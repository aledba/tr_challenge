  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against DoorDash, Inc., a now-defunct California-based food delivery platform, and its former CEO, Karson Theiss, in an emergency action to compel arbitration.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 25, 2019, Theiss and Theiss used DoorDash's platform to provide tips to their drivers, as well as Missouri and Illinois subclasses.  The complaint alleges that DoorDash engaged in deceptive tipping practices, representing that consumers' tips would benefit drivers but instead using those tips to fund the minimum payments that Door Dash guarantees its drivers.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants' tipping practices violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their allegedly ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant.gov website to quickly identify whether they are on inquiry notice of a potential arbitration proceeding.  For example, the SEC\u00c2\u00a0recently issued an Investor Alert alerting investors to the dangers of online tipping. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges DoorDash with violations of Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar.  To learn more about arbitration, see Litigation Release No. 17-1 (2014).  The Complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction, an order requiring DoorDash to comply with the Commission on International Affairs, a court order requiring it to provide a copy of the Commission's Rules of Practice, and to provide an accounting of any alleged violations of these provisions.  Finally, the Complaint seeks an injunction against future violations"
