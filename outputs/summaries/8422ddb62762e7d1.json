  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of a felony charge of domestic violence.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that, from at least August 2015 through September 2016, defendant, who was charged with a felony for his role in a domestic violence case, shot her husband, J, in the leg. The complaint alleges that J, who is from a previous marriage, was the aggressor, and that defendant told J that he needed to defend himself against the threat posed by J. According to the complaint, J replied that he did not have a gun and that he had \"never put his hands on that woman.\" The complaint further alleges that defendant and J continued to argue after J left the house, saying that J had \"grabbed a gun\" and \"got violent\" when he confronted her. J also allegedly threatened to kill himself. The SEC alleges that the defendants agreed to settle the SEC's charges by agreeing to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against J. The case was investigated by the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Criminal Justice. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Oregon State Attorney General's Office."
