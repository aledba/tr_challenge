  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the City of Seal Beach in a civil injunctive action brought by the California Department of Education and the Department of Justice.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the SEC's judgment, which was entered without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, held that, as a matter of law, the city was required to meet and confer with its governing body before placing a citizen-sponsored ballot initiative on the city's ballot.  In addition, the court found that the city had no obligation to meet or confer with the governing body prior to placing the city on the ballot, and that it could not impose a \"meet-and-confer\" obligation upon the city.  As a result of the court's order, the complaint alleges that the City violated its obligations under the federal and state securities laws and, in a parallel action, the California Secretary of State's Office filed an unfair practice charge (UPC) against City of San Diego on January 20, 2012, and the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On February 10, 2011, the Court granted the complaint and ordered a temporary restraining order, an accounting, and an accounting of the amount of money that has been spent on the City's pension system.  Without admitting the allegations of the complaint or ordering an injunction, the City has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and to pay an officer and director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see San Diego Municipal Employees Association v. City of Vallejo (2014) (pp. 582, 584-1) and Cal.Amateur District v. San Diego City Council (2014).  The court granted the request for an injunction and ordered the city to comply with the UPC's order.  Separately, the Commission on Audit and Rulemaking has issued an order appointing an independent receiver to determine whether to issue an injunction against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17"
