  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against a Chicago man accused of driving a minivan into another vehicle.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Chicago, on November 2, 2009, the Chicago Police Department's Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI) conducted narcotics surveillance at the intersection of 63rd Street and Wabash Avenue after receiving information from a nearby business owner that two men were running from the scene.  The complaint alleges that defendant-appellant, Darrell Whitlock, was driving a Chevrolet Silverado minivan at the time of the crash when he recognized the two men from the video.  As alleged in the complaint, Whitlock was driving the minivan when the officers stopped him and pursued him.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Central District of New York entered a guilty verdict for felony murder, attempted first degree murder, and reckless homicide in the death of Valerie Davis.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 30 years and a $1,000,000 civil penalty.  On November 4, 2015, the trial court found defendant guilty on all counts of felony murder and attempted first-degree murder.  He was sentenced to 30 years in prison on September 3, 2015.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Department of Justice in this matter."
