  "summary": "On March 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against a former employee of online retailer Zappos.com, Inc., which allegedly stole the personal information of more than 24 million of its customers, including their full credit card numbers.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Nevada, filed on January 16, 2012, hackers targeted the servers of the online retailer and stole their personal information, including the names, email addresses, billing and shipping addresses, telephone numbers, and credit and debit card information.  The complaint alleges that the data breach places them at imminent risk of identity theft or fraud, and that the company failed to adequately protect its customers.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that, in addition to the alleged theft of the customer information, the hackers used stolen information about the customers to conduct subsequent financial transactions, including opening accounts or spending money in the names of customers who had been targeted by the hackers.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, however, the court has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On March 19, 2019, the Court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction against future violations and granted the defendants\u2019 request for an emergency court order halting the ongoing litigation.  A hearing on March 21, 2019 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 598 (2010).
