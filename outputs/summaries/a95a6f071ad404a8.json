  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against a Mississippi man convicted of capital murder in the Alcorn County Circuit Court of Appeals.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Corinth, Mississippi, alleges that, on February 1, 2016, Micah Bostic was arrested and questioned by the Corinth Police Department, who questioned Bostic about his prior armed robbery of a cab driver. Bostic allegedly told the officers that he wanted to take his mother's advice and that he was going to take her advice. The complaint alleges that the officers continued to question Bostic, despite Bostic's repeated requests to suppress his statements. The SEC alleges that Bostic replied, \"No, I am taking my mom's advice, I want an attorney.\" The complaint further alleges that when the officers confronted Bostic at the scene of the crime, Bostic refused to comply with their requests for an attorney and continued the questioning. The court also denied Bostic and Traylor's requests for a new trial.  On December 1, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint against Bostic for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  In its order granting the SEC's request for a judgment, the court also entered a temporary restraining order, which prohibits Bostic from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for an exemption from the broker-dealer registration requirements. The order also requires Bostic to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders Bostic liable for a civil penalty of $100,000.  Bostic has also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for May 5, 2017.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 19, 2017).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Mississippi Division of Criminal Investigation.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Boggs and supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley of the Atlanta Regional Office."
