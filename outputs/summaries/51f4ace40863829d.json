  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western Division of the District of South Dakota today entered a final judgment against Calmer Cottier, a South Dakota man charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 12, 2015, in the Uinta County Courthouse in Sioux Falls, S.D., a member of a rival gang, the Tre Tre Crips, engaged in a long-running verbal tussle in the backyard of his grandmother's house. The complaint alleges that, as a result of the verbal confrontation at the Cottiers\u2019 home, Cattier and his brothers Terry Goings III, Jerome Warrior, and Billy Bob Bluebird were among the men who allegedly engaged in the tussling, which resulted in the death of Brings Plenty.  The complaint further alleges that the court improperly vouched for the credibility of witnesses, including Goings, who corroborated the testimony of Goings.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed criminal charges against the three men. The SEC also announced that the defendants would be sentenced to prison terms ranging from 210 months to 210 months.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits. The court also granted the defendants the right to return their allegedly stolen property and pay civil penalties equal to their respective profits.  On August 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge David A. Davidson of the Uptown District Court in South Dakota issued a temporary restraining order halting the alleged misconduct of the district court. The order also prohibits the defendants from associating with any third party, including a law enforcement agency, from using the internet to disseminate information about third-party criminal prosecutions.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter."
