  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, on July 26, 2006, Josh Heisler, who also did work for Rutten, entered Rutten's bedroom and found Rutten lying on the floor of his bedroom, unresponsive.  According to the complaint, Williamson told the interrogating agents that he entered the bedroom without authority and that he would not pursue any charges against him.  As alleged, however, the agents raised questions, asking Williamson to consider \"what have you got to lose\" and \"how is it going to hurt[.]?\"  He replied, \u201ca whole lot.\u201d  The complaint further alleges that the trial court did not err in finding that he lacked authority to enter Rutten\u2019s bedroom, if indeed he entered it at all.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Williamson acknowledged entering the bedroom after Rutten was shot, despite having new appellate counsel present at the time of the alleged misconduct.   The court also ruled that, based on the evidence presented to the jury, Williamson was entitled to a hearing at which he would have the opportunity to determine whether to grant a permanent injunction, impose a civil penalty, or otherwise impose a conduct-based injunction.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Williamson has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  He has also agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On November 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Williamson, charging him with violating the antigorgement provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of its Investment Advisers Act and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting certain of Williamson's violations of Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder and with respect to his cooperation in the investigation of the case.  To settle the case, the court granted the SEC"
