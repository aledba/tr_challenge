  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against a New Mexico state police officer who allegedly used excessive force to stop a family of five for speeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Taos, New Mexico, alleges that on October 28, 2013, Officer Tony DeTavis stopped a minivan driven by five children for speeding in a 55-mph zone. According to the complaint, the officers confronted the children and told them that he was going to give them a penalty of $126 within 30 days. The complaint alleges that the officers then fired three shots at the minivan, causing the children to scream and jump in and out of the vehicle. The defendants allegedly refused to comply with the officers' orders to stop the vehicle, and the officers continued to chase after them. The SEC also alleges that De Tavis fired at least one shot at the van, which was then stopped by another officer. The court's order against the officers, which entered a temporary restraining order, permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the officers to pay a $126 penalty. The judge granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the merits of the case and ordered them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, order them to disgorge their illusory gains, and impose civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico announced criminal charges against the Farrells. The case was supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley and supervised by Amy S. Cotter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Mexico State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, the FBI, the Colorado Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
