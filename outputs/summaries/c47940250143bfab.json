  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against a former registered representative of the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that on June 7, 2012, a federal district court in Madison, Wis., entered a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  The court's order also prohibits the appointment of a clinician or other clinician to determine whether a person with a serious mental impairment has a reasonable chance of being able to perform work within the RFC determined by the Commission.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the individual.  According to the SEC's order, filed on June 8, 2012 and unsealed on July 10, 2013, Plaintiff was seen by Dr. Raj Saralaya in Amarillo, Texas, for a second opinion concerning her condition. The complaint alleges that she had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 1976 and had been hospitalized for a heart attack in March 2006, but had no symptoms of the condition.  She also had had foot surgery in 2008 and had had hip surgery in 2009.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Plaintiff has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to return to the United States and pay a civil penalty of $2,500, and imposing a $10,000 penalty against her.  On July 11, 2014, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Dr. Sarallee, charging her with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and seeking a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 15b2-3 thereunder. The SEC is continuing to investigate the matter of whether or not to issue an order imposing a civil monetary penalty against the defendant.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17, July 26, 2014."
