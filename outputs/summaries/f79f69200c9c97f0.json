  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was barred from appearing before the court for failing to exhaust his administrative remedies.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on June 6, 2019, a federal judge in Portland, Oregon, issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering the release of an inmate who had been previously convicted of first-degree sexual abuse.  According to the complaint, the order imposed temporary restraining orders and other emergency relief.  In its order imposing the restraining order, the court found that petitioner failed to adequately exhaust all of the issues that he raised in his petition for judicial review, and that the court had failed to consider the specific legal issues that petitioner raised.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, petitioner consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest.   The court also granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze against the defendant and ordered a hearing on the merits of the case.  To learn more about restraining order relief, see Press Release No. 5, No. 10, and No. 17-cv-1 (2014).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against the individual charged in the case, charging him with violations of Sections 144.335(1)(b) and (2) the books and records and reporting provisions of Sections 206(1) and 206(2)(A), and charged the individual with violating Section 13(b)(2)(B) of Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule 12b2-3 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, as well as an order appointing a receiver to conduct an independent investigation of the alleged violations of Section 12(b).  The case is being handled by John C. Dubin, Torquemada Meets Kafka: The Misapplication of the Issue Exhaustion Doctrine to Inquisitorial Administrative Proceedings, 97 Col. L. Rev. 1289, 1309 (1997) and the appointment of a receiver under the supervision of a state parole board. \u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U. S. Attorney's Department of Justice, and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission."
