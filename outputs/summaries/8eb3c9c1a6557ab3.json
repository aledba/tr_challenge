  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the former shareholders of American Realty Capital - Retail Centers of America, Inc. (RCA) and American Finance Trust, Inc.'s (AFIN) merger.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, the former RCA shareholders learned that AFIN was worth less and was less healthy than represented in the proxy statement that induced their vote for the merger. The complaint alleges that the proxy statements omitted material facts about AFIN's financial condition, including that the company's NAV had declined in 2016 before the merger was finalized and AFIN had a management contract that was difficult to terminate because it had a twenty-year term.  The complaint further alleges that, in 2014 and 2015, AFIN and AR Global had management contracts that required AFIN to maintain a NAV of $24.17 per share.  AFIN, through an affiliated company, created and sold its Merrill Lynch properties at a higher capitalization rate than the capitalization used to calculate the December 31, 2015 NAV and thus at a price that might lower AFIN or RCA's NAV.  In addition, the proxy allegedly omitted information about the financial condition of AFIN during the merger, which was not disclosed in the Proxy.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the RCA Shareholders consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains plus interest. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael O. Basinger and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Karpel. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
