  "summary": "On April 10, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Del Norte County, New York, alleges that, on October 27, 2015, a jury found Henry Lee Grandberry guilty of a single felony count of unlawful possession of a dirk or dagger while incarcerated at Pelican Bay State Prison. The court also found that Grandberry failed to adequately explain or deny any of the evidence presented at trial, including that he had served a prior prison sentence for first degree murder, a 1996 conviction for first-degree robbery, and a 1988 conviction for second degree robbery. According to the complaint, Grandberry also failed to tell the jury that he received the classification chrono and agreed it was accurate. The complaint further alleges that he failed to explain to the jury why he delayed a year before providing support for his story at trial and why he \"agreed\" with the decision to place him in administrative segregation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
