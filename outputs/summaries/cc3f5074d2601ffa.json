  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against E.B. For violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, N.J., alleges that, on July 14, 2014, a trial court in New Jersey found that, based on unproven and unreliable testimony, a defendant with a history of sexual violence committed a felony committed a prior felony. The complaint further alleges that E. B. had been convicted of two prior felony acts of deviant sexual behavior, which included initiating contact with a fourteen-year-old girl, missing required treatment sessions, and failure to notify police of an address change. The SEC alleges that the defendants' statements, which were not supported by the experts' evidence, constituted net opinions.  According to the complaint, the defendants also failed to adequately demonstrate that they had a history and background of contact with underage females, which did not lead to convictions.  In addition, the complaint alleges the defendants failed to properly focus their opinions on the current condition of E. b. who received an eighteen-month sentence for Community Supervision for Life (CSL) violations.  E.b. also allegedly participated in a gang attack on a group of young girls at a public swimming pool.  Dr. Harris and Dr. Carmignani also agreed that the defendant had a significant risk of reoffending if he were to be committed pursuant to the SVPA.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty, and requires him to register as a sex offender under Megan's Law. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On November 17, 2018, the Honorable Judge James F. Mulvihill of the Federal District Court in Newark issued a temporary restraining order and ordered E. to comply with the court's order. The court granted the request for an emergency court order, which requires the court to determine whether to impose a civil penalty against the defendant based on the findings of the trial court. The order also requires the defendant to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court for further determination by the court upon motion of the court.
