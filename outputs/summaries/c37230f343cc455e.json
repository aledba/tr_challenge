  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against a Florida-based company and its president for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, alleges that, on August 9, 2017, Raj Dubey, President of True Penny, Florida, and his company, AmResorts, LLC, solicited a job offer from a Massachusetts resident while he was at home in the Commonwealth.  According to the complaint, after receiving the offer, the resident immediately notified his employer that he would be resigning from his position to take the job with True Penny.  As alleged, the relationship between the two men deteriorated, and Plaintiff never worked for True Penny as a result of the alleged misconduct.  In addition, the complaint alleges that neither defendant traveled to Florida to negotiate nor was performance contemplated in Florida, despite the fact that he did not own the land and instead acted through power of attorney.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the securities laws, require them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties of $10,000 and $20,000, respectively.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17.  On August 13, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the Boston Regional Office issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and imposing a civil penalty of $50,000.   The court also issued an order suspending the sale of the company's stock and ordering the company to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
