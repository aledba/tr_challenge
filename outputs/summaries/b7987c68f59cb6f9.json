  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Darrell Havens, a former prison inmate, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that, from 2008 until 2015, Havens was incarcerated at Fort Lyons Correctional Facility in Bent County, Colorado.  According to the complaint, as a result of Havens\u2019s incarceration, he was denied meaningful access to the programs and services available to able-bodied inmates at the prison.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Havens failed to adequately demonstrate that he was entitled to reasonable access to certain of the services and programs offered by the prison, and failed to show that he had the requisite knowledge and understanding to make a reasonable determination about whether those services and services should be provided to him.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Havens from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078, and orders a civil penalty of $100,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 562 F.3d at 1229.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in New York, charging Havens with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 5(b).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Colorado today announced criminal charges against Havens arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On September 18, 2017, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone entered a judgment ordering the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the issues raised by the complaint and to determine whether it was appropriate to issue a judgment imposing permanent injunctions against future violations, imposing civil penalties, and appointing a receiver to determine the appropriate amount of relief to be distributed among the affected inmates.  A hearing on September 19, 2017 was scheduled for 11:30 a.m. Eastern. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the SEC's Denver Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by"
