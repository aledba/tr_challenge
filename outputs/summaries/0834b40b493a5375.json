  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against a former state trooper accused of orchestrating a triple-murder that left seven potential jurors unharmed.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that, on July 11, 2012, a trial judge improperly seated seven jurors on the first day of jury empanelment without having inquired of them whether they had been exposed to media coverage of the case and, if so, whether such exposure had led them to form a bias against the defendant.  According to the complaint, the defendant replied to a question posed by a witness by saying, \"We good.\"  The complaint further alleges that the defendant allegedly used his cell phone to communicate with a coventurer who was at the victim's home to make a drug deal.  In addition, the complaint alleges that after the jury deliberated for approximately one hour, the jury found the defendant liable for a total of five felony counts of murder and sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of a fair and impartial trial.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  On August 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Steven J. Webster of the Boston Regional Office issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney. The order also orders the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of restitution that he has already paid to the jury.  To learn more about jury selection, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (2014).  The case was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Massachusetts Commodities Futures Trading Commission in this matter."
