  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New Hampshire today entered a final judgment against Lakes Region Water Company, Inc., a New Hampshire-based water company, and its customer, Robert Mykytiuk, ordering Lakes Region to refund a second base charge it had imposed on its customer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Nashua, New Hampshire on November 10, 2016, alleges that Lakes Region violated the federal securities laws by failing to provide timely and accurate information about the nature and nature of a service provider's obligations under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and failing to inform the customer that the company was not required to charge a separate base charge or a separate meter for the additional service.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Commission failed to provide sufficient information to determine whether the additional base charge was an unreasonable or unreasonable charge and whether the company had met its duty to do so.  For example, the SEC's order requires that a company pay a \"burden of proof\" of proof, including whether it has a duty to show that it has complied with the Commission's rules, and that it is entitled to a fair and equitable treatment of its customers.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Lakes Region has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions and orders it to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, a $20,000 penalty, and a $25,000 officer-and-director bar.  Lakes Region also agreed to pay $1,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as an officer and director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Massachusetts Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
