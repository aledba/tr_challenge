  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former registered nurse and her husband in a drug conspiracy case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that, from June of 2014 through September of 2014, Anthony Markeith King and Kristen L. Raines, both registered nurses at Little Rock-area medical clinics, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, King and Raines agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  Raines also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in any government investigation of the clinic and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization.  In addition, Raines was ordered to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and ordered to comply with a court order requiring him to provide a \"good faith\" explanation of his role in the alleged drug conspiracy.  Without admitting the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Raines from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders Raines to pay civil penalties of $2,500 and $3,500, respectively, for each of those violations.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 17-cv-8221 (Feb. 26, 2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U. S. Secret Service in this matter."
