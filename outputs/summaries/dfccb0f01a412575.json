  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that the court improperly relied on a statistical table to determine the length of Clemons\u2019 sentence. The court found that Clemons had been previously convicted of a felony for improperly discharging a firearm, robbery, and twice committing felonious assault. According to the complaint, Clemons was previously sentenced to 80 months in prison for those same crimes. The SEC alleges that, in Clemons' case, the court relied on the statistical table rather than on the actual sentencing average, which Clemons claimed was reasonable because he was being targeted, not only by the community, but also by the law enforcement. Clemons also allegedly engaged in a pattern of witness intimidation, including one in which he shot a sixteen-year-old boy in the leg during a fight. In addition, the complaint alleges that when Clemons pleaded guilty to a felony, he was sentenced to a sentence of 80 months, which was significantly higher than the federal sentencing average. The complaint further alleges that in sentencing Clemons, the district court relied too heavily on the national sentencing average and did not consider the relevant sentencing factors in determining his sentence. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Clemons.  In a related matter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained a court order temporarily freezing Clemons's assets, freezing his assets, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000. The agency's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry. The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and Carol S. Cotter of the Boston Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Office of International Affairs. The investigation was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Antonia G. Gottschall of the New York office, and the case is supervised by Lara S. Mehraban of the Atlanta office. The trial is being led by Mr. Werner under the supervision of Mr. Braunstein. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the U."
