  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Colorado today entered final judgments in favor of the Colorado Department of Commerce in a related case.  The court entered a final judgment on consent against Yakutat Land Corp.'s (\u201cYakutat\u2019s\u201d) Mountain Coaster project, finding that the mountain coaster project was properly classified as a Park and Recreation Facility, rather than as an Outdoor Commercial Recreation or Entertainment Establishment.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Estes Park, Colo., on January 4, 2020, the Colorado Division of Commerce issued an order requiring the District of Commerce to determine whether a proposed park and recreation facility should be classified as an outdoor commercial recreation or entertainment establishment.  In its order, the court found that the proposed structure and use of the property fell within the \"park and recreation\" provisions of the federal securities laws, and that it was reasonable to determine that the project fell within that definition.  Without admitting or denying the findings of the court, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the District Court to determine the appropriate use classification for the project. The court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-4-102(1)(b) (C.A.R. 50).  The Court of Appeals also issued a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of Section 13(a)(4)(A) and (c) thereunder. The Court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered the destruction of any evidence supporting its findings, and appointed a receiver to oversee the investigation. The District Court will consider the merits of the case upon motion by the parties."
