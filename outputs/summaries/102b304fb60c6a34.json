  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former Portland Police Bureau officer for his role in a DUII case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on September 7, 2015, Officer Scott of the department's Traffic Division pulled defendant's car over after detecting signs of impairment during field sobriety tests (FSTs). According to the complaint, Scott told the officer that he had received 24 hours of standardized FST training, which included participating in two \"wet labs\" that simulated the use of alcohol in a vehicle. The complaint further alleges that Scott described his performance on the FSTs as \"the product of scientific research.\" The complaint alleges that the officer's testimony, based upon his training and experience, was not scientific. Rather, the complaint alleges, the officer had relied on the scientific underpinnings of those tests, and he had failed one or more of the tests.  Scott agreed to settle the SEC's charges by agreeing to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Scott arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint. The SEC also announced that it filed criminal charges in the parallel criminal case against Scott.  On May 24, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Scott, charging him with violating the antiligence provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) the federal securities laws and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Scott consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering him to comply with the court's order, and imposing a $2,000 civil penalty. The court also ordered Scott to pay disgorgment of $9,965, which is $1.05 per hour, and to pay prejudgment interests of $2.05.  A hearing scheduled for May 26, 2019 is scheduled for June 5, 2019.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Eric R. Werner."
