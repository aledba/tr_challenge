  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Alaska today announced criminal charges against a Klawock, Alaska attorney accused of defrauding injured workers out of millions of dollars.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alaska, alleges that the Alaska Attorney General's Office (ABA) improperly overstated the amount of attorney's fees awarded to injured workers.  According to the complaint, beginning in June 2012, Sandra Rusch injured her back while working for Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium (SEARHC) in Alaska. The complaint alleges that SEARHC failed to adequately consider the issues raised by the claimants, including whether Graham had performed reasonable work in the field of personal injury and workers' compensation, and whether he had provided timely and effective assistance in resolving their claims.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the ABA has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the Board from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The SEC also charged Graham with violating the duty to consider reasonable fees when evaluating a claim for compensation.   The complaint charges the Board with overcharging for services performed by injured workers, and the complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, officer-and-director bars, and penny stock bars against Graham.  It also seeks a permanent injunction against Graham from violating the broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws, as well as an order requiring him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and a penny stock bar against him.  Finally, the complaint charges Graham with overstating his experience as an attorney by claiming that he had performed \"reasonable\" work in multiple states, including advising workers on certain compensation issues, and that he provided timely assistance in settling their claims without being able to provide timely or effective assistance. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being"
