  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin today entered a final judgment against defendant Luis Fernandez, who was convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison, Wisconsin, alleges that Fernandez was falsely told that the gun belonged to his friend, Adam Voecks, and that he had obtained the gun from a friend who had recently died.  According to the complaint, however, as alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant was not able to establish the full content and context of the statements he had given to Frusti during the two interrogations.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the defendant told the officer that he did not see who had placed the gun in the center console of the car.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Fernandez.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Fernandez consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $5,000 and a $100,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wisconsin Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
