  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against the defendants for their participation in a fraudulent student loan debt relief scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from at least April 2013 through September 2015, the defendants made numerous false and misleading representations to consumers through inbound telemarketing and radio advertising, and through out-to-market calls to consumers who responded to the defendants' websites.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud student loan borrowers by falsely promising to reduce or eliminate their student loans.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, these representations were not true and the defendants failed to adequately allege that they were liable for the alleged violations of the federal and state securities laws.  For example, the SEC alleges that one of the defendants, Damien Alvarez, falsely claimed that he was entitled to relief when, in fact, he was not entitled to any relief at all, and that he had no role in the scheme. The complaint also alleges that, in a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the District of Miami today announced criminal charges against Alvarez.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint filed in the federal court, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, and from participating in the offering and sale of securities. The final judgments also order the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants the right to a temporary restraining order and to a conduct-based injunction, which is subject to court approval.  On December 13, 2016, the Honorable Judge John J. O'Sullivan of the United States District Court in Miami issued a preliminary injunction against the Defendants' violations of Section 13(b)(2) and Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, and ordered the Defendants to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million and $2 million, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the SEC. The SEC also issued an order suspending the Defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for today for January 24, 2017.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Cohen and Eric R. Werner of the Miami Regional Office."
