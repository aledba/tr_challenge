  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Gary and Kristin Marks.  The SEC's complaint alleges that the Markses violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, filed in federal district court in Little Rock, Arkansas, the defendants failed to comply with discovery sanctions imposed by the trial court on their motion to reopen the record.  In a parallel action, the SEC charged the defendants with acting as unregistered brokers in the sale of a warranty deed to Gary Alan Marks and failing to provide complete discovery responses to their requests for the warranty deed.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders them to pay civil penalties of $32,500 each.  On December 5, 2016, the court granted the defendants' motion for reconsideration and ordered them to vacate the premises.  As set forth in the complaint:    The defendants' response to the discovery requests was deficient, was inconsistent with their representations to the court, and they failed to respond to the requests.  They also failed to provide any corroborating evidence for their claims that the defendants had engaged in a pattern of misconduct that led them to violate the discovery sanctions.   In addition,   the Defendants' subsequent November 23, 2016 motion to compel discovery was verified and presented in the court's order. &nbsp;   On January 18, 2017, a trial court entered an order compelling discovery on a motion for a new trial in an action tried without a jury on September 14, 2016. The court then issued an order requiring the defendants to provide full and complete responses to all discovery requests by 5:00 p.m. on January 24, 2017.  A hearing on January 25, 2017 was scheduled to consider the merits of the case and determine whether to impose additional sanctions against the defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
