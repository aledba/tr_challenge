  "summary": "On September 4, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of South Carolina entered a final judgment in favor of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, Inc., a South Carolina-based provider of family planning services.  The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal health care law.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Charleston, South Carolina, on August 24, 2017, the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services terminated PPSAT from South Carolina's Medicaid program.  In its order, the court held that, in the absence of a court order requiring the termination of the program, the state would not be able to provide services to Medicaid-eligible patients.

In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for South Carolina today announced criminal charges against Ms. Edwards for her role in the alleged violations of these provisions.  On September 5, 2018 the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against PPSat, alleging that it violated the federal securities laws, and ordering the company to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty and disgorg"
