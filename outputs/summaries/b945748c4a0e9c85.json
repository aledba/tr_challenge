  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jersey City Police Officer Joseph Labarbera for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against A.A. from future violations of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, on July 7, 2016, two individuals suffered non-life-threatening gunshot wounds to the leg as a result of a street shooting that occurred on Wilkinson Avenue in Jersey City. The complaint alleges that, despite having been advised of his right to self-incrimination by law enforcement officers, the defendant ultimately made an incriminating statement that was not produced by the direct questions of the officers. The SEC alleges that the defendant was not restrained by his or her parent, and that he was not subject to unreasonable searches and seizures.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Laberbera and Rogue. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's New Jersey Division of Criminal Investigations, and is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Office of Inspector General, and the New York Police Department."
