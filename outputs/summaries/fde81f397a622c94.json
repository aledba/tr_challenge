  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in favor of Anica Ashbourne, a tax attorney and certified public accountant, in her second civil action.  The court found that Ashbourne violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered her to file a single, consolidated complaint containing all of her Title VII claims in a single proceeding.  According to the court's order, Ashbourne filed a complaint in June 2010 with the Department of the Treasury alleging that she was terminated by the same defendants in her first and second federal actions, and that she had not been given a timely right-to-sue letter in her administrative proceedings.  Ashbourne's second complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, alleged that her termination and related events violated the anti-discrimination provisions of the federal securities laws.  In its judgment, the court found Ashbourne liable as a defendant for violating those provisions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in Ashbourne\u2019s second action, the Court also ordered Ashbourne to comply with the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of those provisions, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.   The SEC previously issued an order suspending Ashbourne from appearing before the SEC as an attorney.  On May 28, 2011, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Ashbourne and two of her former supervisors for violating the same anti-fraud provisions in her initial complaint.  It also issued a temporary restraining order, barring her from participating in future litigation, and requiring her to provide a copy of the complaint to the SEC's Office of Inspector General, which is conducting an examination of the matter, to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support her claims.  Finally, on November 9, 2012, a federal district court in Maryland entered a judgment against the defendants in their personal capacities for improper service of process for Ashbourne II, a second complaint filed in the same district court for the second time in May 2016, and a third complaint in September 2015. The court also granted summary judgment for the other defendants in the second case, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each.  As set forth in the order, the settlement is subject to court approval, and the court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1153 (D.C. Cir. 2013).  The Court also granted a preliminary injunction against future violations"
