  "summary": "On October 30, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Hustler Club, a New York-based adult entertainment club, and two of its members in a sales and use tax audit conducted by the Department of Taxation and Finance.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, the club's sale of scrip, a form of in-house currency that the club sold to its customers at a 20% markup, constituted a \"live dramatic or musical arts performance\" and was exempt from the amusement tax.  The complaint alleges that, in addition to the 20% surcharge imposed on its scrip-purchasing customers, it charged entertainers and floor hosts a fee to redeem the scrip paid to them by patrons.  As alleged in the complaint, the fee for the private room and the private dance were separate, and the club did not \"merely\" offer such performances, so as to qualify as dramatic for purposes of the exemption.  To obtain a private dance during the period in question, customers were required to pay a \u201croom charge\u201d to the club and an additional fee directly to the entertainer, which could be paid in cash or, if the customer paid by credit card, with scrip.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the Club consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the club to pay $2,113,204.38, plus statutory interest, for a total of $4.8 million.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the club.  On October 31, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Barry. The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Complex Financial Instruments Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in this matter."
