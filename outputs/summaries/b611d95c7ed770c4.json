  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Kentucky today announced criminal charges against a Kentucky man accused of orchestrating a long-running drug ring.  According to the SEC's complaint, on February 15, 2016, the Kentucky State Police conducted a stop and search of a truck in Nelson County, Kentucky. The complaint alleges that the officers observed Keeling drive up to a certain house on a certain night to transport a supply of methamphetamine. Keeling allegedly followed the officers' instructions to stop him, and the officers followed him to another suspected drug house. The SEC alleges that Keeling continued to drive the truck after the officers stopped him, but the officers continued to search the truck, finding more guns and over 100 grams of methamphetamine in the vehicle.  The complaint further alleges that during the search, Keeling dropped his right hand and reached for his waistline.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a temporary restraining order against Keeling and ordered him to surrender his passport. The court also denied Keeling\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering him to comply with the court order, and ordering Keeling to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Keeling consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see United States v. Ostrove, 567 F.3d 754, 762, and 206 S.Ct. (2010).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an investor's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.
