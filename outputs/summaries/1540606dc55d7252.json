  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment in favor of the dance academy's motion to dismiss its claims against the charter school.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, since at least 2010, the Dance Academy of Chicago (the dance academy) engaged in the practice of performing professional theater and dance instruction to middle and high school students at two of the school's campuses.  According to the complaint, on February 24, 2017, the plaintiffs sat on a bench after being instructed to do so by a charter school employee. The complaint alleges that the plaintiffs' counterclaim was filed in violation of Section 13-204(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 13-20 thereunder, and that it was time-barred because the defendants had failed to file their original complaints within the one-year statute of limitations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's order, the dance Academy consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 24, 2018, the trial court granted the dancers' request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants' assets, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million and $2.2 million, respectively. The dance academy has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000 and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The court also granted the plaintiffs the right to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest and to request a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities laws. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Department for the Northern District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
