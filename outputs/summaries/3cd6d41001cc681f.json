  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a Fort Worth, Texas man who was convicted of felony assault causing bodily injury.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on June 13, 2016, in a federal district court in Houston, Texas, Latricia A. Tyler was charged with a felony for her role in a domestic violence case.  The complaint alleges that Tyler was the only person in the room with a gun when she was confronted by Petitt, her neighbor, and a woman she identified at trial as a \"district attorney.\"  As alleged in the complaint, Tyler ran toward Petitt and slammed into her, causing her to shake and recoil, and then proceeded to kick her about before the officers returned to the scene.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against Tyler, charging her with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, Tyler consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders her to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and imposes a five-year officer-director bar.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Office of Inspector General."
