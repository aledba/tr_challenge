  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and two medical providers for failing to pay outstanding medical bills.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, between August 29, 2009 and November 17, 2011, Liberty and two other medical providers, Marque Medicos Archer, LLC and Medicos Pain & Surgical Specialists, S.C. (collectively, the providers), delayed paying medical bills to an injured employee of codefendant-appellant, Morse Automotive Corporation (Morse Automotive).  The complaint alleges that the providers failed to pay their obligations under the settlement agreement and failed to timely pay their bills to the IWCC.  According to the complaint, in a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Liberty for breach of contract and for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Liberty has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders it to pay $163,000 in disgorgement, $41,751 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $50,000.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of both defendants, and ordering Liberty to pay a $75,000 civil penalty in the amount of $40,000, which is equal to the amount owed to the injured employee in the alternative.   The court also granted Liberty's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 8.2 of the Insurance Code, and ordered the providers to pay civil penalties of $55,000 each. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael D. Bogenberger and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
