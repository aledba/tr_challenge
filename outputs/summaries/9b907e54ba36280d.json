  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against a former principal of a public school for making false and misleading statements in an anti-SLAPP motion.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, alleges that, in 2016, former principal Richard Hicks sent a letter to the Diocese of Los Angeles informing them that he wanted to allow the producers of a television show to film the school's campus for the purpose of raising funds for the school. According to the letter, Hicks instructed a group of middle school males to be instructed by him about masturbation and fired a staff member who complained about the activity to parish and Diocesan officials. The complaint further alleges that in the fall of 2016, Hicks asked Richard to serve as the chair of a school advisory board for the 2016-2017 school year, despite having been discharged from the school the previous year, Hicks repeatedly refused to disclose the accrediting organizations' findings. Hicks also allegedly had not convened another advisory board meeting in the subsequent 10 months, contrary to the collaborative approach recommended by and promised to the school community. In addition, the letter alleged that Hicks had previously permitted a motorcycle dealership to use the school for a photo shoot and had received complaints because of the pornographic nature of the photographs taken. The SEC alleges that Hicks violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hicks has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Education today announced criminal charges against Hicks arising from the same conduct alleged in the letter. The Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of investing in a private school.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and whether they have any background in any matter of public interest. Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to identify people who are likely to be targets of investor fraud."
