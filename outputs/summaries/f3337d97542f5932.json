  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Colorado yesterday entered a final judgment against the City of Denver for its negligent operation and maintenance of a public sewer main.  The court found that the City had waived its immunity under the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (CGIA) by hiring an independent contractor to perform the work on the traffic light.  According to the court's order, Apeiron Utility Construction (Apeiron) was contracted with the city to do the maintenance work on a traffic light in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  As alleged in the complaint, the city did not have the personnel or equipment to bore under the road to place the conduit, so it hired a private contractor to do this underground drilling work.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against the city.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Denver, alleges that the city violated its duty of care to safely maintain its utility, electric, and sewer lines.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the City consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of its civil penalties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael P. Powell and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Department of Transportation, and the Colorado Office of Inspector General.  For further information, see Press Release No. 24-10-106(1)(f).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Barry, with assistance from Joseph G. Sansone, and Mr. Powell will lead the case."
