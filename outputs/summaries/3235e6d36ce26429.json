  "summary": "On May 27, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against Hyundai Motor America, Inc. and New World Car Imports San Antonio, Inc., finding that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 2301 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Austin, Texas, between 2010 and 2013, Hyundai made material misrepresentations to a Texas-based independent fact-finding agency in its determination of whether a company required adherence to the 100% sales efficiency standard.  The SEC alleges that, contrary to these representations, Hyundai improperly allocated vehicles to its dealers to meet the requirement.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2009, during the first six months of Mr. Hetrick's tenure as regional general manager, he provided 134 cars through discretionary allocation to Red McCombs and 20 to World Car.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hyundai consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAS).  The litigation will be led by Kenneth Culp Davis and Richard J. Pierce, Jr. and supervised by Lara S. Mehraban."
