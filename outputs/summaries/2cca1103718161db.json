  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Department of Corrections (DOC) in a civil action brought by a former corrections officer who alleged that he was sexually exploited by a DOC employee while he was an inmate at a Vermont prison.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least April 2011 through June 2014, DOC violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that DOC failed to adequately investigate the allegations of sexual misconduct by Salls and plaintiff, and failed to provide adequate response to the allegations.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in late May 2011, DOC began receiving reports of boundary violations regarding Salls's conduct, including reports that Salls ate in the dining hall with plaintiff, reports of Salls spending too much time in the cells, and reports about Salls' strange behavior with plaintiff in the recreation room.  According to the complaint, Salls agreed to work overtime but agreed to participate in the repositioning of the camera so that it would be able to spot Salls during the investigation.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, DOC consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also granted a temporary restraining order against Salls, ordering her to return to her duties as an officer and director of a public company, and ordering DOC to conduct an independent investigation of her conduct.  On June 12, 2011, the court granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of the State against DOC, and ordered DOC to comply with the court's order. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against DOC. The SEC is continuing its investigation of the same conduct alleged in the complaint. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U. S. Attorney's Department of New Jersey, and the Vermont Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
