  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Cox Communications, Inc. and CoxCom, LLC, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least 2011 through at least 2014, Cox violated the federal securities laws by failing to comply with a mandatory safe harbor provision for internet service providers.  According to the complaint, Cox failed to show that it was liable for contributory infringement when, in fact, it was not liable because it had not implemented a policy entitling it to a safe harbor defense.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Cox did not adequately record or record its receipt of any infringement notices, despite repeated reminders from the court to do so.  As alleged, the SEC's final judgment, which permanently enjoins Cox from violating these provisions, orders the company to pay $25 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and orders Cox to pay civil penalties and legal fees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the company consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal laws, ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and ordering Cox to disgorge its allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, pay a $25,000 civil penalty, and pay an officer and director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Koon and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the United States Secret Service in this matter."
