  "summary": "On January 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut entered a final judgment against Doctor's Associates, Inc. (\"DAI\"), a Connecticut-based company that owns and operates a Subway franchise.  According to the court's order, filed on February 15, 2017, Alemayehu sought to purchase an existing Subway franchise in Colorado from Gary Newcomb.  The court found that, in denying his application, DAI violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that, as a result of the district court's finding, the parties did not agree to arbitrate the franchise application.  In addition, the court ruled that the arbitration provision of the Franchise Application was not supported by sufficient consideration, that there was no binding contract, that the parties had not agreed to arbitration, or that DAI engaged in its own wrongful conduct.    In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Connecticut today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Connecticut, charges DAI with violating the anti-discrimination provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(5) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000, and require them to provide background checks and other assistance in determining whether the parties agreed to arbitrates the franchise applications.  Additionally, the judgment orders DAI to pay a $50,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval, and requires the parties to provide a background check and a recommendation on how to proceed with the arbitration.  On March 2, 2019, the Court granted the motion to compel arbitration and ordered a hearing on the merits of the matter.  To learn more about arbitration, see Litigation Release No. 17(e) of June 17, 2017 (S.D.Ct. 2017).  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by J. Appellee and Graham Loomis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Office of Financial Regulation."
