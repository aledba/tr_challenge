  "summary": "On August 24, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment ordering the eviction of a former tenant of Park Lake Residences in Hempstead, N.Y.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 21, 2015, Curel Patterson, a co-tenant at Park Lake, was arrested on July 10, 2012, for participating in a fight outside Hempstead High School.  The complaint alleges that Curel was not removed from the subsequent recertifications until there was a court order authorizing him to evict the tenant.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the court granted the landlord's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Curel to recertify the rent subsidy and renew the lease for 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Curel.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the landlord consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $3,557.00. The court also granted the tenant's motion for an asset freeze and ordered the landlord to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2017.  This matter was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in this matter."
