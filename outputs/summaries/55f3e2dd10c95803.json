  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that the SEC improperly assigned little or no weight to a treating physician's opinion based on the fact that Howard had been disabled since July 15, 2011.  According to the complaint, Dr. Ricardo Fermo, MD, a registered clinical trial physician, evaluated Howard on a consistent basis for five years and concluded that Howard was not disabled. The complaint further alleges that Dr. Fermo provided the agency with over 200 pages of treatment notes, which contained evidence of Howard's improvement, but did not support his view that Howard could perform any meaningful work activity.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, based on Howard's subjective complaints, Fermo's opinion was not entitled to controlling weight, and that Howard would likely experience difficulty in a work setting due to his severe mental impairment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the SEC has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining the SEC from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the SEC to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Fermo and his companies.  On May 18, 2018, a magistrate judge issued an order appointing a receiver to evaluate Howard's mental health. The receiver is scheduled to respond to the order on August 21, 2019, with a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to comply with the court's order.  A hearing scheduled for September 24, 2019 is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 19, 2017).  The complaint charges Fermo with violations of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206-8 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-director and penny stock bars.
