  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the medical board's motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the board, and ordering the payment of a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that, in August 2011, the board obtained information about a patient who was being prescribed high-risk, highly addictive and dangerous drugs through a program of controlled substance prescriptions.  According to the complaint, the Board obtained a copy of the patient's prescriptions from the CURES database, which contained detailed information about the patient.  In its order, the court found that the Board violated the patients' right to privacy when it obtained the records without a reasonable expectation of privacy.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order, Michael Chiarottino consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil monetary penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization.  On May 2, 2013, the U. S. District Judge for the Southern District of New York granted the Board's request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, ordered the Board to comply with the subpoenas, and ordered the board to provide an accounting of the amount of money spent on the investigation.   The court's order also ordered the investigation of the matter by the California Office of Inspector General, which conducted an examination of the issue of patient confidentiality. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Scott Frost and supervised by Marc Blau of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the California Department of Health and Human Services, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
