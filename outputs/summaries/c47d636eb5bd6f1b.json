  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against the City of Diboll, Texas, charging the City with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Texas Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, Texas on May 13, 2015, the city and its officers violated the antiligence provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to publish red light camera violations.  The complaint alleges that the city violated Section 17 (a)(1) of that federal securities law, and that it failed to comply with certain of those provisions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the City consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the city's officers and a civil injunctive action against the officer and director of the agency.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Fort Worth Regional Office by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Fort Worth Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson, Ms. Gibson, and Mr. Boren.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17 (4/20/17).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Dallas Police Department, and the Texas Department of Insurance in this matter."
