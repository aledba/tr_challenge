  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two New York City officers who allegedly caused a woman to lose her right to a fair trial.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, on February 18, 2016, a woman who was arrested and subsequently incarcerated for disorderly conduct while parking in a crosswalk outside a Vitamin Shoppe in Manhattan was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that the defendants made four false representations to the jury, including that the plaintiff was the hero and the cops were not, that she had hit a police officer with her car, and that the defendant had left the scene of the crime.  The complaint further alleges that, in deciding to terminate the plaintiff, Officer Davodian and another Montefiore surgeon told the plaintiff that she did not hit the officer.  Instead, the defendants allegedly told her that the officer had hit her with his car and that he did not see any evidence of such injury.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the defendant officers' fabrication of evidence led to the plaintiff's deprivation of liberty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of $1,181,549, prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil penalty of $200,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 24, 2019).  The SEC&rdquo:  The Complaint seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest from the defendants, as well as civil money penalties."
