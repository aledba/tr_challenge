  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the trustee's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, on November 30, 2006, Ameriquest Mortgage Company (\"Ameriquest\"), the loan originator, purchased a group of residential mortgage loans from a codefendant, pursuant to a Mortgage Loan Purchase and Loan Repurchase Agreement (MLPA).  The complaint alleges that, in the MLPA and RA, the trustee made various representations and warranties regarding the general underwriting practices and quality of the individual loans, including that a contractual remedial provision was in full force and effect, and that the trustee could cure or repurchase those loans within six months of the date of the termination of the action.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that when the trustee failed to remedy the breach, the trust terminated its action immediately after the termination.  The court's final judgment against the Trustee, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins the trustee from future violations of the provision, and orders the trustee to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the trustees agreed to a permanent injunction and to the appointment of a receiver to determine whether to proceed with a civil action against the defendant.  On November 29, 2012, the court granted the trustee the temporary restraining injunction and ordered the receiver to comply with the pre-judgment approval of the final judgment.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the New York Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Manhattan, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (FINRA), and the Federal Office of Inspector General (OIG) in this matter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov website\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint Bulletin on\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act\u00c2\u00a02014,\u00c2\u00a0requiring investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0Adviser"
