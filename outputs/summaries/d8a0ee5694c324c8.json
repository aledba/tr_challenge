  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of Eureka and five individuals in an ongoing civil action brought by the city.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 14, 2010, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, defendants engaged in a pattern of conduct and tactics that led to the filing of a civil action against the city and several individuals.  The complaint alleges that, shortly after filing this complaint, the City issued an inspection warrant for the Sunny Avenue property, which the complaint alleges violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that City Manager Michael Knight acted as an unregistered broker-dealer in executing the warrant.  As alleged in the complaint, this conduct was consistent with the conduct of the City's own employees, and the city's failure to respond to the complaint.  In addition, the complaint alleged that the City violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act, Section 904.1(a)(13) and Rule 9b2-3 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and orders them to pay $57,414.28 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $34,918.50.\u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  This case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the San Diego Regional Office.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.
