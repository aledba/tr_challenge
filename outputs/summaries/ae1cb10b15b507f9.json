  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Chase Holdings, Inc. (\"Chase\"), a San Diego-based real estate investment adviser, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 580(b) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego on March 21, 2011, Chase alleges that on May 20, 2004, Carol Coker purchased a condominium with the assistance of a $452,000 loan from Valley Vista Mortgage Corporation.  The complaint alleges that the loan was secured by a deed of trust, which guarantees the security of the property.  As alleged in the complaint, however, when a borrower defaults on a purchase money loan, the lender is liable for a deficiency judgment against the borrower.  In a parallel action, on March 10, 2010, a federal district court in Los Angeles entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Chase from violating Section 580b, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $375,061, which is equal to the amount of the principal owed on the loan.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Chase consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering the sale of the condominium to a third party.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Scott A. Birkenheier.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
