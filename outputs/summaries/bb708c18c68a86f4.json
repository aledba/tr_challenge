  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of a California-based woman who was incarcerated for selling drugs.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Bernardino, California on January 6, 2012, Mary K. was incarcerated when she gave birth to A.C. and was due for release in July 2013.  The complaint alleges that, while incarcerated, Mother made an inappropriate plan for the child's care and supervision in that she had designated her maternal uncle and godmother as an appropriate family members, and the maternal grandparents and maternal uncle were unwilling to provide care for the baby.  As alleged in the complaint, Mother failed to reunify with the children, and in 2009 her parental rights were terminated and the girls were adopted by a foster family.  In 2012, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Mother and ordered her to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Mother consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On January 13, 2013, a federal district court in Riverside County, California entered an order granting the court an emergency asset freeze, freezing the assets of the defendants, and imposing a $1.5 million civil penalty against Mother.  A hearing scheduled for February 27, 2012 was scheduled for 11:30 a.m. that same day, but was not scheduled for that time.  After the hearing, the judge issued an order requiring the court to determine whether to grant the court a temporary asset freeze and order the defendants to return the assets to the defendants.   The court also ordered the defendant to provide an explanation for why she had not made an appropriate plan in the five months that she spent in custody, when she had been told by a social worker that she would be placing the child with a relative or other adult custodian, and when she was unable to do so because she was incarcerated and had a history of substance abuse and mental health issues, she would not be able to make an appropriate decision.  Finally, on January 4, 2012 the court denied the defendant's request for an asset freeze against her and ordered the release of the baby from the custody of the California Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS).  In a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the defendant. "
