  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a case brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, N.Y., alleges that, since at least 2011, the federal government has imposed a six-month delay on the issuance of a court order requiring a bond hearing for an alien detained pursuant to Section 1225(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1940.  According to the complaint, this delay is a relic of a now-defunct federal rule that requires mandatory bond hearings after six months in immigration detention.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court previously issued a temporary restraining order requiring bond hearings for certain aliens detained under the federal order.  As alleged, the court's order requires that bond hearings be conducted \"across-the-board to each putative class member\" in order to determine whether a reasonable bond hearing should be required.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for six months or more.  Additionally, the judgment requires that the defendant pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement and prejudgment interest that would be imposed by the court upon each of the class members.  For further information, see Litigation Release Order No. 17-CV-6263-FPG, 2018 WL 5269992.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Brooklyn, New York, charging a defendant with violating the federal due process provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The complaint also charges a defendant for violating the mandatory bond hearing provision of Rule 1225, and seeks a permanent injunction against further violations of that provision, as well as a penalty from the court for further determination by the defendant.  On March 18, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone, Judge of the Southern Division of New Jersey, issued a preliminary injunction against the defendant and ordered him to comply with the court order. The court granted the motion for a temporary injunction and ordered Sansone to comply.  A hearing is scheduled for May 24, 2019.  To learn more about the subject matter of immigration detention, see"
