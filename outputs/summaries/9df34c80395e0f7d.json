  "summary": "On February 23, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Kentucky entered a final judgment against Scottie McCarty, a Kentucky resident who was sentenced to prison for orchestrating a multi-million dollar real estate fraud.  The court found that McCarty violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  McCarty consented to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  According to the court's order, McCarty agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.00 per month.  Risner also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against McCarty.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Magoffin County, Kentucky, charges McCarty with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties against Risner. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Scott L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
