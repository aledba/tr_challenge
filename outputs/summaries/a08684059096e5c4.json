  "summary": "On August 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the federal government's motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and imposing a civil injunctive action against the defendants.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that, since at least 2010, the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") has issued a series of orders requiring federal employees to participate in certain off-duty \"partisan\" activities, including: (1) participating in political rallies or meetings; (2) serving as an officer in a partisan political organization; (3) attending events for a partisan candidate for office; and (4) driving voters to the polls on behalf of a party or candidates.  In addition, the complaint alleges that certain employees engaged in non-partisan political activity, including, among other things, attending partisan fundraisers and attending party conventions, rallies, or meetings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the DoJ has agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar.  On August 3, 2019, the Court granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the Doj's orders, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000. The court also granted the defendants' motion for preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  To learn more about DoJ's obligations under the federal securities laws, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-221 (2014).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against two federal employees for their roles in the DOJ's Office of Inspector General's (OIG) Office of Public Education (OIEA) and Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCEA) frauds. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of these provisions, as well as civil penalties against the other defendants. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit in the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Criminal Justice."
