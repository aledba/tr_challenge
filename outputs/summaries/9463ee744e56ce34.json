  "summary": "On November 9, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Fifth Judicial District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against J.B. \"J.B.\" Claimant, a clerk of courts for the Allegheny County Orphans' Court, for violating the federal code of conduct for employees of the Unified Judicial System.  According to the court's order, filed in January 2018, Claimant had a relationship with an inmate in the county jail. In the course of that relationship, she hid Inmate's vehicle, ostensibly used in a crime, and hid the $80,000 it contained in her home. Claimant also allegedly told Inmate she needed to be put in cement shoes and sunk in the river. The court found that Claimant violated the work rule when she hid the vehicle and the cash in the spare room of her home while Inmate was in the County Jail.  The court also found that, contrary to Claimant's characterization, the referee improperly reopened the record without a written request by any party.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court agreed to the final judgment that permanently restrains Claimant from receiving UC benefits under Section 402(e) of the UJS Code of Conduct. The final judgment orders Claimant to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay a civil penalty, and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Allegheny announced criminal charges against Claimant. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Mark Rymas of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Eric R. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
