  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona today entered a final judgment against defendant James Clayton Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, Arizona, alleges that Johnson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Johnson raised the issue of whether the court should impose a death penalty based on the facts of the case, including that Johnson had a history of substance abuse, was an adolescent when he started abusing drugs, and was an adult when he committed the crime.  Johnson also alleges that the court improperly restrained him from raising any reasonable questions about the nature of the crime, including whether there was a reasonable basis for a sentence less than death.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Arizona today announced criminal charges against Johnson, charging him with one count of first degree murder and two counts of second degree murder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Johnson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires him to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the judgment, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The court also granted Johnson the right to return a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws and ordering him to comply with the court\u2019s order barring him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On August 7, 2019, the court granted Johnson a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, to be deemed satisfied by the amount of money he has already paid in restitution, and to pay civil penalties of $2,500 and $3,500, respectively.  A hearing scheduled for September 5, 2019 is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release Order No. 13-4031 (2014).
