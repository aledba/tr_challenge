  "summary": "On March 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against appellee for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that Appellee, who was previously sentenced to prison for identity fraud, held himself out as an eligible offender by failing to disclose that he was under investigation for bad appraisals. The complaint further alleges that, as a result of his conduct, appelle was unable to participate in the business because of his poor financial condition. The SEC also found that, in committing identity fraud while under investigation by the Division of Real Estate, he produced a number of seriously under-secured mortgages that, if defaulted, could potentially cause future economic harm to the lending institutions and the borrowers.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against the defendant.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on January 13, 2016, the trial court found that appelmanlee committed identity fraud in violation of Section 2929.12 of the Exchange Act and Rules of Practice, and that he had violated Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933. The court also ruled that Appelmanlee violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 13b2-B thereunder and that it had no jurisdiction to determine the severity of the alleged fraud.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Appellelee consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2019, the court issued a judgment ordering Appelle to comply with the court's order and to submit a second assignment of error to determine whether to proceed with the case against him. The judgment also ordered Appellem to pay restitution in the form of a $100,000 civil penalty, a $10,000 officer-and-director bar, and a $50,000 penalty. The final judgment also requires Appelmanlem to submit to the court a written statement acknowledging the seriousness of his alleged fraud, and to provide an explanation for why he did not respond to the Commission's order. The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael R. Kasper and supervised by Scott A. McKinley of the Ohio Office of Inspector General. The litigation will be led by"
