  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Nevada today entered a final judgment in favor of the California Department of Water Resources (DWRID) in a water rights case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 22, 2018 in the United States District Court in Las Vegas, Nevada, the Commission on Environmental Quality (CEDQ) issued a temporary restraining order on June 7, 2018, ordering the DWRID to comply with the court's order.  The SEC alleges that the Commission issued the order without admitting or denying the Commission\u2019s findings, and that the Court improperly held that the District Court had jurisdiction over the issue.  In its order, the court also ordered the Commission to determine whether it had sufficient authority to issue a temporary injunction against the Commission from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal water laws.  Without admitting to these findings, the commission agreed to a final order that permanently restrains and enjoins it from violating these provisions, and from issuing any other orders or orders. The Commission also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, which is equal to the amount of water that will be sent to the receiver of the receiver, and to pay an $8,500 civil penalty against the receiver.  On June 13, 2019, the Court granted the Commission's request for an injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as an order appointing a receiver of receiver of receivers of receiver water.  To learn more about water rights in Nevada, see Water Resources Control Board v. Nevada State Engineer (1936).  The Commission has also issued an order suspending the issuance of any order or order directing the receiver to provide water to a specific location within the Walker River Basin.  A hearing on June 8, 2019 will be conducted by David H. Gottschall and Glenn S. Gordon in the Denver Regional Office, with the assistance of John Rymas of the Division of Environmental Quality and the Nevada Division of Fish and Wildlife.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-20, May 24, 2019. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's complaint charges the Commission with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Commission with violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0the Commission's Rules of Practice, and with aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(b)(2) and 16(a)(3) of"
