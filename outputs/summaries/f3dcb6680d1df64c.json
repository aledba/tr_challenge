  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Missouri today announced criminal charges against a Desloge, Missouri man accused of repeatedly threatening law enforcement officers at two separate traffic stops.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Francois County, Missouri, alleges that, on August 30, 2016, Officer Jacob Sitton of the Deslogee, Missouri Police Department was driving his patrol vehicle when he encountered Schelsky driving a stolen Pontiac Trans Am with a broken taillight.  According to the complaint, after the first traffic stop, Scselsky raised his pistol and aimed it at the two officers, causing them to fear for their lives.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, the defendant did not fire his pistol.  Instead, the complaint alleges that SchelSky raised his gun and pointed it at one of the officers at the second stop, causing him to lose control of the gun, and causing the officer to withdraw his taser from his holster.  In a parallel action, the Missouri Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed an emergency action and obtained a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and issuing an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the case, Sitton consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,500, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Richard J. Pyszka entered a judgment ordering Sitton to pay $1.5 million in civil money, and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay a $500,000 civil penalty, and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Sitton agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction that prohibits him from further violating the federal securities laws, including Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and requires him to provide a copy of the Commission's Rules of Practice, including an explanation of why he did not comply with the Commission\u2019s Order, and to provide an explanation for why he didn\u2019t comply with its order.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Missouri Office of Criminal Investigations."
