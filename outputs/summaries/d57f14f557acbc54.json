  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against York Healthcare & Wellness Centre LP, a California-based nursing home, for failing to timely file a case management statement (CMS) with the Department of Health and Safety.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that York failed to file a CMS within six months of the filing of the department\u2019s answer to a complaint concerning a long-term care facility citation.  According to the complaint, York was cited because in December 2014 its facility failed to properly address a resident's dehydration and severe constipation, and as a result of drugs it administered, the resident developed an infection and had to be rushed to the hospital for treatment. The complaint further alleges that, following 2013 amendments to the California Rules of Court, York filed a complaint with the court, alleging that, in violation of Rule 212, the department improperly delayed filing of a CMS until after the court had reviewed the complaint. The court ultimately ruled against York, finding that York violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1428(b) of the federal securities laws, and ordered York to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. York agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay $20,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $25,000 and $50,000, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the California Department of Justice today announced that it has filed a civil action against York. The SEC also announced criminal charges against York arising from the same conduct that led to the SEC's investigation of York.  On May 16, 2017, the court granted a temporary restraining order against York from further violations of the anti-fraud provisions and ordered him to submit an amended complaint to the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, York consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering York to comply with the order. The final judgment orders York to submit a amended complaint, which was filed on May 17, 2016, and requires York to respond to court orders by June 15, 2017. The Court granted the request for an injunction against further violations"
