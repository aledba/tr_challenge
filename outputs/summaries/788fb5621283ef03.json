  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against a DeKalb County man accused of orchestrating a series of drug-related robberies.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Michael Blaine, a convicted felon, led a group of people who targeted drug dealers and others with the purpose of robbing them.  According to the complaint, Blaine and his accomplices, Darren Batteast and Johnny Travitt, convinced Blaine to join them in a scheme to steal $50,000 worth of drugs and other personal items.  Blaine allegedly told the men that he would use the stolen goods to make a drug deal and that he had got locked up.  As alleged, however, the defendants did not steal the goods and instead used the stolen money to make Ponzi-like payments to the victims.  Instead, the complaint alleges that Blaine led the men to a house where he met Yucef Ellis, a known drug dealer, and demanded that he tell the group where the remainder of the money was.  On the morning of September 23, 2006, after meeting Blaine at Tara Carnes\u2019 house to conduct a drug transaction, the men allegedly entered the house and began beating Ellis, who was lying on the ground covered in blood, with a gun.  At a pre-trial hearing, the jury found Blaine liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Atlanta today announced parallel criminal charges.   The case is being handled by Scott A. Williams, John Rymas, and Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Justice in this matter."
