  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission against them.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in 2012, Applied Underwriters, Inc. and its subsidiary, T&M Framing, Inc., violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to adequately disclose to the Commission that the arbitration provisions of the Exchange Act were not enforceable, and that the Commission had no authority to rule on the enforceability of the delegation and arbitration provisions.  In addition, the complaint alleges the Commission failed to consider the arbitration provision as a valid and enforceable part of the contract.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $10,000, and ordering the Commission to issue an order requiring an injunction against violations of the Exchange Act.  Additionally, the Commission has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1,500, which will be determined by the court upon motion by the Commission.  On May 23, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. G. Sansone of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued an order enjoining defendants from violating Section 10 of the\u00c2\u00a0Exchange Rules\u00c2\u00a0and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $100,000.\u00c2\u00a0The Commission's order also prohibits defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any type of insurance, including reinsurance, without a court-ordered injunction, and prohibits them from engaging in any conduct that constitutes an unreasonable search and seizure of property, including the right to a penny stock bar.  It also prohibits the Commission from issuing an order appointing an independent arbitrator to determine whether an arbitration provision is enforceable under the Exchange Rules.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-11658 (2014).  The Commission's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in this matter."
