  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against a group of Christian Indonesians who were ordered to return to the United States by the Indonesian government.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Hampshire on November 27, 2017, Jeffrey Winters, Ph.D., a New Hampshire resident, and two other Indonesians with final orders of removal were encouraged to come \"out of the shadows\" and identify themselves to ICE during the humanitarian program. The complaint alleges that, in exchange, they were granted temporary stays of removal and placed under Orders of Supervision, which allowed them to seek employment and also prescribed conditions with which they would be persecuted after removal.  The complaint further alleges that the government never made any promises or agreements that the defendants could stay in the country indefinitely.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants were not permitted to apply for the right to re-enter the country after their removal, and were instead subject to an emergency court order that would halt their re-entry.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Winters consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement today announced that it has obtained a temporary restraining order halting the illegal entry of certain Indonesian nationals into the country. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban. The Office of International Affairs has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) in this matter."
