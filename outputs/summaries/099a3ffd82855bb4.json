  "summary": "On January 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina entered a final judgment against Michael J. Slager, Jr., a former officer with the North Charleston Police Department, who was sentenced to 240 months in prison for his role in the April 4, 2015, shooting of Walter Scott.  The court found that Slager violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  Slager agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $500,000 officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, Slager consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of 240 months.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Slager.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York on January 17, 2018 and unsealed on January 24, 2019, the SEC charged Slager with violating Section 15(b)(2)(A) and Rule 15b-5 thereunder, and Slager was charged with aiding and abetting Slager\u2019s violations of Section 16(a)(1) and (3) of Rule 16a-3 thereunder and with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder; and with aiding Slager in violating Section 13(d) of Exchange Act Rule 13d-1.   The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a penalty equal to the amount of time served by the defendant.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 549 (4th Cir. 2013).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
