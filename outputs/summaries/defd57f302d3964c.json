  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment in favor of the City of Powell, Ohio, in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, in April 2016, the city of Powell issued a Zoning Certificate to Golf Village North, LLC, a religious order conducting services and Bible study sessions in a residential neighborhood.  According to the complaint, the Zoning Administrator's May 5, 2016, response was not sufficient to warrant an injunction against the application.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the city issued a temporary restraining order preventing Golf Village from violating the federal securities laws and requiring it to submit a site plan for a residential hotel.  In a parallel action, on May 24, 2017, the Sixth Circuit granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction against further administrative action against Golf Village, and ordered the city to consider whether to issue a final decision on whether to grant the injunction.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000 and a civil penalty of $1,000.

The complaint also alleges that defendants violated the Administrative Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) by failing to timely submit a final application for a Zoned Credential, or otherwise attempting to use the federal court as a shield against a state enforcement effort.  As alleged in the Complaint, the Defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and Section 15(a)(2) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder.  Finally, the Commission found that, as a matter of law, defendants violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of"
