  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing criminal case against Carlos Urbina-Fuentes.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Laredo, Texas, alleges that, on February 16, 2017, a federal district court in Miami, Florida, entered a final judgment finding that the Florida burglary statute is indivisible and that a defendant should be entitled to relief if he has suffered a clear and severe violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Central District of Florida today entered final judgments against the defendants in a related criminal case.  According to the SEC's order, the court entered the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, however, that the court improperly used the 2016 model to determine whether to apply the new model to a defendant who had been previously convicted of a similar felony and who was still on supervised release at the time of his conviction.   The court found that the 2015 model did not meet the criteria for a defendant to qualify as an \"aggravated felony\" under the federal sentencing guidelines, and instead imposed a four-point enhancement for a previous conviction for a felony burglary of a dwelling under the applicable Florida statute.  On February 24, 2018, the Florida court entered a judgment ordering the defendants to pay a penalty equal to the amount of their prior criminal convictions, which would have required them to be sentenced in the same manner as the first three prongs of the sentencing guidelines.  It also issued an order requiring the defendant to surrender his passport and to surrender to the court at a later date.  Finally, on April 18, the Miami court issued a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the federal, state, and local sentencing laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties of at least $100,000, $50,000 in disgorgement, and $10,500 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $75,000.  Additionally, the judge issued a temporary restraining order halting the defendants\u2019 entry of a building or conveyance with the intent to commit a crime of violence, and ordered the judge to issue an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the stolen property.  Without admitting to the facts of the case, the defendants consented to the appointment of a receiver and to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining them from violating the federal and state sentencing laws"
