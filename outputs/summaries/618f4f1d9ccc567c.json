  "summary": "On May 28, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order (TRO) against two Arkansas parents for unlawfully terminating their parental rights to their minor child, Z.P. (D/O/B February 24, 2017).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson County, Arkansas, alleges that Rachel Peterson and her husband, Franklin Peterson, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint also alleges that the court improperly terminated Rachel Peterson\u2019s parental rights because she was unable to provide services to the child at the time of her removal.  According to the complaint, the court found that the parents were not capable of independent parenting and that they had failed to remediate the issues that caused the child to be removed from their home.  Further, the complaint alleges that, despite repeated requests for the parents to cooperate with the court, Rachel continued to maintain an inappropriate home that included dog feces; broken glass; trash on the floor; no hot water; an infestation of mice; and an opossum.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New York today announced criminal charges against Franklin and Rachel.  On May 29, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action (TPR) against Franklin, Rachel, Franklin, and Franklin, seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay civil penalties, and bars them from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-funded entity, and orders the destruction of any evidence that may have been obtained in connection with the TPR proceedings. The court also ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is twice as much as the amount of their legal fees.  Additionally, the judge appointed separate attorneys to represent Rachel and Franklin in the case.   The court granted the defendants\u2019 requests for an injunction against future violations, and ordered the court to consider the merits of the case against them.  Among other things, the Court found that Rachel had a history of mental illness and had been hospitalized for suicidal ideations and hallucinations, and that Franklin had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder.  As a result of the court order, Rachel was placed in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) without reasonable efforts to resolve the underlying issues of her"
