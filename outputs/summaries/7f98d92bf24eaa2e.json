  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California yesterday entered a final judgment against Jon Davler, Inc., a cosmetics company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that, among other things, that Davler violated the employment-related practices exclusion by failing to disclose that one of his employees had engaged in a sexual misconduct with a co-worker in the company's bathroom.  According to the complaint, Davler also failed to disclose to the co-workers that the alleged misconduct occurred out of an employer-employee relationship.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the employees' claims were based on false imprisonment, fraud, wrongful termination, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief, and ordering the company to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the California Office of Inspector General, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Arizona Office of the Secretary of State's Office."
