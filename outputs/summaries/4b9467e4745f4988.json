  "summary": "On May 10, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of South Dakota entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sturgis, South Dakota, alleges that Ronda Halvorson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the administrative adjudication provision of Section 15(b)(1) thereunder. The complaint alleges that the federal district court entered final judgments in favor of the defendant, finding that the FTCA's preemption provision was inconsistent with the federal statute of repose.
