  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia today announced charges against a Hampton, Virginia man for his role in a recent drug-related criminal case.  The SEC's complaint alleges that on May 18, 2017, Hampton Police Officer Juan Figueroa, while conducting a routine background check on a convicted felon, located a green Crown Royal bag containing 12.65 grams of cocaine, \"roughly $1,000\" in $10 and $20 bills, and 45 MDMA (methamphetamine) pills. According to the complaint, the bag contained two firearms wrapped in a pair of jeans and two Gatorade bottles. The complaint further alleges that the bags were inadmissible because they were not \"physically signed by a judge.\"  The complaint also alleges that a \"large quantity of [drug] dealers carry firearms\" on their person, and that Miosa Henderson owned the gray Ford Fusion that Raspberry drove on the day of his arrest.  In a parallel action, the Virginia Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Raspberry arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC's earlier criminal case against him.  On May 19, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Raspberry, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Raspberry consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-01-389."
