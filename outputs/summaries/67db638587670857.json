  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska yesterday entered a final judgment against a Gordon, Nebraska man for first-degree criminal trespass in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 28-520 of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on April 3, 2017, at a Subway sandwich shop located in the same physical structure as a Pump & Pantry convenience store, Rudy Stanko entered the building and received a letter from the company issuing the letter stating that he was not licensed or privileged to enter the building. The complaint further alleges that the letter specifically stated that, under the affirmative defense set forth in \u00a7 28-522(1)(a), the building was open to members of the public, and that the defendant had complied with all lawful conditions imposed on access to or remaining in the premises. In addition, the complaint alleged that, as a matter of law, the defendant was not permitted to enter or remain in the building until he had received the \"stay away\" letter.  According to the complaint, however, the company had previously sent a letter to the pump & pantry stating that it would no longer carry the newspaper at the time it was open for business. The letter also stated that Stunko was not lawfully following the conditions imposed upon him because he failed to follow the \u201cstay away\u201d letter directed toward him.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of these provisions, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Nebraska Department of Commerce, and the Nebraska Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
