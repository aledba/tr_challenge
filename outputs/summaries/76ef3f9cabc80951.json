  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against a group of men accused of stealing a firearm.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that Nathaniel Perez, David Semprit, Vanessa Dubey, Ricky Alcantara, and Ricky Perez violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants stole a firearm from Perez's car and discharged it twice into the air. The complaint alleges that the defendants knew that the weapon was a firearm, but did not have the requisite knowledge to determine whether the weapon met the statutory definition of a firearm or whether it was capable of discharging a shot or bullet. The SEC also alleges that Perez failed to adequately demonstrate that he had knowledge of the specific physical characteristics of the firearm that made the weapon a firearm according to the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Perez, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of one year and a half. The court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordered them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Perez consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to return his allegedly stolen firearm to the court for a full accounting. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 534 (2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Boston Police Department, and the Massachusetts State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
