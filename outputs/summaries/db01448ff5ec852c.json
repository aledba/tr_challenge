  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the producers of a television series based on the life of the Mexican-American celebrity Jenni Rivera, who died in a plane crash in December 2012.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, alleges that, from at least September 2013 through September 2016, the producers and producers of the TV series \"Jenni Rivera\" breached a nondisclosure agreement with Salgado. According to the complaint, Salgado allegedly breached the agreement by signing a notarized affidavit under penalty of perjury, signing a cease-and-desist letter, and then failing to disclose his breach of the agreement to the producers. The complaint alleges that Salgado also violated the contract by drafting an unpublished manuscript of a book about Rivera, which he did not read, and by failing to tell the producers he had signed the agreement. In addition, the complaint alleges the producers failed to disclose to Salgado that they had received a cease and desist letter from Salgado shortly before they began producing the series, and that they failed to inform Salgado of their obligations under the agreement and to inform him of their intent to breach it. Finally, the SEC alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 12b2-2, and 12b3-3 thereunder. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the defendants' ill-gotten gains plus interest, and a civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Consumer Affairs, and the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California in this matter."
