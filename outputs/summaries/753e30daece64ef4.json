  "summary": "On June 19, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Mississippi entered a final judgment against Lisa Pritchard, a Montgomery County, Alabama woman who was charged with filing a false divorce complaint.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Lisa was never properly served with process when she filed a complaint for divorce with the Chancery Court of Lowndes County, Mississippi.  According to the complaint, on March 1, 2017, Donald filed a divorce complaint with the court for divorce on the basis of adultery, habitual drug use, and desertion or, in the alternative, irreconcilable differences.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that after Donald entered the final judgment of divorce, he received a second copy of the complaint from Lisa, signed it, and sent it to Lisa's residence sometime between two days and two weeks after she delivered the certified mail to Lisa.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Donald for his role in the alleged misconduct.  On June 20, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Donald, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Lisa's violations of Rule 4(c)(5).  The court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against Donald from further violations of the federal securities laws, and ordered him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $25,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Donald consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, orders him to comply with the requirements of Rule 5(c) and imposes a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any such order, and requires him to submit to a court-ordered injunction against future violations of Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder of the Exchange Act.  Donald also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office.
