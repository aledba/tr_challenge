  "summary": "On January 31, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against Danny Walterscheid, a cattle investment company owner, and his business partner, Clint Sicking, in a civil theft case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cooke County, Texas, alleges that, from at least 2014 through at least 2015, Danny and Sicking engaged in a series of cattle purchases as part of a broader cattle investment arrangement.  According to the complaint, the defendants made misrepresentations concerning the nature of the cattle investments and failed to disclose that Sicking had signed a Consent Decree that required him to pay for the cattle purchases.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Danny did not have any ownership or control over the cattle, and that he never provided any financial assistance to Sicking.  Instead, the SEC alleges that he and Danny engaged in two seemingly successful cattle transactions, one of which resulted in the loss of approximately $1 million, and the other one resulted in a total loss of almost $873,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Danny agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Sicking to pay $385,121.20 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $65,000 civil penalty.  Sicking has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, and ordering him pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.3 million.  He has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay a $2.5 million civil penalty and to pay an officer and director bar.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 17, 2016, the court entered a judgment enjoining Danny from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act and Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13d-1 thereunder.  It also ordered Sicking not to violate the agreed-upon settlement provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder and ordering the payment of a civil monetary penalty of $256,558."
