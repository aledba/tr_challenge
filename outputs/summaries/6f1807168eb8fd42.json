  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Massachusetts yesterday entered a default judgment against Tenacity Construction Inc., a Massachusetts-based construction company, for failing to timely respond to a summons and complaint filed by George P. Dumas III.  The SEC's complaint alleges that on January 13, 2014, Dumas was working for Dumas Roofing Company, Inc., on a construction project in Northborough, Massachusetts. According to the complaint, he served as a senior project manager by delivering in hand to Mark Foley, the person in charge of Tenacity's business at the time of service. The complaint further alleges that Foley was not served and was not in charge when the project was completed. The SEC alleges that the deputy sheriff's return of service constituted prima facie evidence of service, which Tenacity had failed to overcome.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Dumas.  On May 17, 2016, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Tenacity to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Tenacity consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $3,256,300 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Tenacity also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Dumas has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws and to the appointment of a receiver of the company's books and records. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (2014).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Personnel Admin. and Ms. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
