  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Vivint Solar, Inc. (\"Vivint\"), a California-based solar power company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 17(b) and (c) thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Vivint and his wife, Margaret Aanderud, entered into an arbitration agreement with Vivint in July 2014 pursuant to which Vivint agreed to pay $250, which is approximately equivalent to current Court filing fees.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of this agreement, all of the Aanderuds' individual claims were subject to mandatory arbitration, and the arbitration provision did not apply to the individual claims.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Vivint did not disclose to Margaret that he had spoken with a JAMS case management employee who advised there was a $1,200 filing fee and $5,000 retainer to set up an arbitration.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Vivint also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a civil penalty of $250.   The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
