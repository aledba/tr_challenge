  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jason Douglas Hensley, a Conway, Ark., man who was convicted in a jury trial of kidnapping, rape, aggravated assault, and aggravated residential burglary. The jury found him liable on all of these charges.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Conway, Arkansas, Mr. Hensly told the jury that he was going to kill himself because he had no life and needed to see his ex-wife once more before he took his own life.  The complaint further alleges that he used a box cutter from his pocket to cut his wrists and used a pair of handcuffs to restrain his wife.  He also allegedly told his roommate that he had a gun and wanted to have sex with her.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the jury found that he did not have the right to use a gun, and that he needed to get out of the house.  After the jury deliberated for a short period of time, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Arkansas today announced criminal charges against the husband of a woman who was also convicted of a residential burglary and sentenced to thirty years in prison.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to return to his prior criminal conviction, and ordering the destruction of any evidence that may be relevant to his future criminal conviction. The court also ordered the husband to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  On February 22, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Mr. Smith, charging him with a felony for his role in the scheme. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Matthew Hugen and Carol Murnahan of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Ms. Smith and Mr. Hugen, and the case is being supervised by Assistant Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Christopher R. Basinger of the Atlanta Regional Office. The case has been supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley."
