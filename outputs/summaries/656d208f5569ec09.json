  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Federal Railroad Administration in a case brought by the freight railroads.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Spokane, Washington, alleges that the 2008 Rail Act gave Amtrak the ability to impose its own set of metrics and standards without the involvement or control of a neutral federal agency.  According to the complaint, the federal agency had the right to determine whether to impose those standards on its competitors.  As alleged, however, the arbitration provision in Section 207(d) of the Rail Act expressly prohibited Amtrak from imposing those standards without a court's approval.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, without an arbitration provision, Amtrak could not impose those metrics or standards unilaterally without the approval and consent of the federal government.  For example, as alleged in the complaint:  The arbitration provision prohibits Amtrak from unilaterally imposing its own self-interested regulatory measures over its competitors without the consent and control of an arbitrator.  Without a court-ordered arbitration, Amtrak would have no power to determine how to proceed with those standards and standards, and would have to rely on the assistance of the agency that issued those standards.  On the other hand, the SEC's case is being handled by the Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Division of Enforcement's Enforcement's Risk Analysis Task Force. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission."
