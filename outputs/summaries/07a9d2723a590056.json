  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota today entered a preliminary injunction against a Minnesota-based high school athletic league and several of its officers for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that the Minnesota State High School League violated its rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.  According to the complaint, filed in federal district court in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the league violated its obligations under the federal securities laws by prohibiting boys from participating on high school competitive dance teams because they are male.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Minnesota today announced criminal charges against two Minnesota high school seniors for their participation in high school dance teams.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, D.M. and Z.G. were among the first to sue the league, alleging that it violated their First Amendment rights by excluding them from participation on their school\u2019s competitive dance team.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of federal law, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $10,000 and $20,000, respectively.  Additionally, the court granted the boys\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order, which is subject to court approval, freezing their assets, and barring them from participating in any activities or sports for the rest of their lives.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal court in Minnesota against the League, charging it with violating its First Amendment right to equal protection under the securities laws, and with aiding and abetting the violations of the First Amendment by the Minnesota Department of Education, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in connection with this matter.   The complaint charges the League with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and seeks a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 5(b).  In addition, the complaint seeks preliminary injunctions against further violation of Section 15(a) and Section 17(b)(2) and (c) of The Securities Act of 1933, and seeks an officer-and-director bar and penny stock bar against the defendants.
