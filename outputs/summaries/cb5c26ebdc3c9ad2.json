The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, alleges that, on October 3, 2012, Daniel Ramirez, a resident of El Paso, Texas, filed a false and misleading complaint alleging that Geico delayed paying his medical bills. According to the complaint, Geico allegedly delayed paying the medical bills by more than a week, and then did not make any additional payments to his chiropractor until August 26, 2013.

The judgment also prohibits defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security in connection with an insurance policy, and from engaging in any conduct that constitutes a reasonable claim for relief. In addition, the order prohibits the defendants from making materially false, misleading, or deceptive statements to the court, and prohibits them from acting as unregistered brokers or agents. The Court also ordered the defendants to provide a copy of the complaint to the SEC, which was approved by the court on September 13, 2014.
