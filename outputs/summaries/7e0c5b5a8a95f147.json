  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Jaki M. Lipscomb, a former Pontiac Correctional Center officer who was convicted of attempted escape from a penal institution.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on or about December 22, 2013, defendant, who was incarcerated for a prior felony, attempted to escape from Pontiac.  According to the complaint, defendant told one of the officers that he had a \"hand drawn map\" of the prison where he had been incarcerated, and that he placed a dummy in his bed to conceal himself from the officers.  He also allegedly told the officer that he was going to \"cuff up\" the dummy and \"put it in the cuffing hatch.\"  The complaint alleges that the officer did not respond to the defendant's repeated requests to be shackled.  In addition, the complaint alleges the defendant did not tell the officer about the dummy when he was being shackled, and did not mention the fact that the dummy had been removed from view during the trial.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunctive relief order.  On March 4, 2019, the court entered final judgments against defendant, ordering him to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws.   The court also ordered the defendant to pay a $25,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Office of Inspector General, the Illinois Department of Criminal Justice, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Michigan, and other emergency relief agencies."
