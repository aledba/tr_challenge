  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas on June 14, 2019 entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins Arkansas resident Ladonna Huddleston from terminating her parental rights to AH (born August 9, 2015) and ID (born September 29, 2010). According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas on May 17, 2019, Huddleneston, who lives in Arkansas, told the court that she was unaware of the abuse and that she would protect her children and keep them safe from harm. However, the court found that she did not do enough to prevent the children from being removed from her custody and ordered that she be placed separately from JD due to his severe mental health issues. The court also found that Huddlneston failed to comply with the case plan and court orders. The complaint further alleges that she allowed two men into her home during her trial home placement, which led to the sexual abuse of ID and the destruction of ID's physical and mental health.  The complaint alleges that the court improperly classified the evidence in its order as \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the children were at substantial risk of serious harm if she were to be placed in an acute treatment facility.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Huddneston.
