  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on December 19, 2016 entered a final judgment against defendants in a securities fraud case brought by a group of investors in a Cayman Islands-based investment advisory firm.  The SEC's complaint alleges that defendants used various means to manipulate the Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate (BBSW), a rate set at the relevant times in Australia but allegedly used widely in the United States and elsewhere in the world as a benchmark for the pricing of various financial derivatives among other purposes.  According to the complaint, BBSW was assigned by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to FLH, a Delaware-based entity incorporated under Part VII of the Companies Law, and was required by Rule 17(a)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to be a \"foreign limited partnership.\"  The complaint further alleges that FLH was not entitled to the requisite authority by virtue of being an assignee of a foreign limited partnership, and that it had no standing to bring the litigation in its own name.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against defendants.  On December 19th, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the assets of the defendants, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief, and requiring them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.   The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, offer and sale of securities, and registration of the securities in the issuers' names.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17(b)(2)(A) and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
