  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the parents of three severely disabled children who were left out of school for several years because of DOE's failure to provide them with IEP-related services.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, the Department of Education (DOE) and Department of Health and Human Services (OHHS) failed to provide timely and appropriate IEP services to their children.  The complaint alleges that the DOE's policies and procedures were so inconsistent and widespread that, in some instances, they prevented the children from attending school.  In addition, the complaint alleges, DOE failed to adequately evaluate the needs of the disabled students, including J.P., M.C., and O.A., who suffered from a rare genetic disorder that causes muscle spasms, hydrocephaly, and frequent severe seizures.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the DOE and OHHS have agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the DOE to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (Aug. 5, 2016).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage parents to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that DOE violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and that OHHS violated Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and penny stock bars against the defendants.   The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Education's Cyber Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Education, and the U.K. Secret Service in this matter."
