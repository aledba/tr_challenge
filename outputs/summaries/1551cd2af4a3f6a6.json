  "summary": "On September 12, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against Amazon.com, Inc., a cloud computing company, and its Vice President of Sales for the healthcare and life sciences sectors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that Amazon and Moyer violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, as a condition of working for Amazon, Moyer agreed not to violate the provisions of the federal securities laws and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of sales of any product or service that does not directly or indirectly compete with Amazon.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Moyer was not required to disclose material non-public information about Amazon's business interests and goodwill.  As a result, Amazon's complaint alleges, it was unable to determine whether Moyer had access to any documents containing such information and that he should be restrained from contacting existing AWS financial services customers or potential Google Cloud/AWS healthcare customers.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Amazon consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar in the amount of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to find out whether they have any conflicts of interest.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Moyer for his role in a related criminal case brought by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit, under the supervision of Marc Blau. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, and the Department of Justice in this matter."
