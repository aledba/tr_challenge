  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Social Security Administration employee who claimed to have suffered severe migraines.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City on March 1, 2018, Kelly L. Berryhill, a registered representative for Social Security, falsely claimed that she suffered debilitating migraine headaches and side effects of medication.  The complaint alleges that Berryhill told her doctor that she had suffered severe migraine headaches over ten years, and that her medication had not worked and she suffered severe side effects.  Berryhill also allegedly claimed that her migraine headaches were frequent and severe.  As alleged in the complaint, Berryhill's testimony was inconsistent with the evidence presented at the hearing, and she was unable to perform the jobs that she claimed she could perform.  In a parallel action, on January 10, 2019, the United States District Judge in Manhattan entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Berryhill from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Berryhill to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million, and ordering the payment of a civil monetary penalty of $250,000.  She also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply for the security of the company's securities.  On January 11, 2020, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Berryhill and ordered her to surrender her passport and other documents related to her claims of having suffered migraine headaches.  A hearing scheduled for February 17, 2017, was rescheduled for February 24, 2017.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 539 (7th Cir. 2004).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Bunn and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00c2"
