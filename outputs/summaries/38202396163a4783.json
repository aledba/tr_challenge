  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered final judgments in favor of the estate of HomeBanc Corp., which was in the business of originating, securitizing, and servicing residential mortgage-backed securities.  According to the court's order, on August 3, 2007, Bear Stearns & Co., Inc. (jointly referred to as \u201cBear Street\u201d) and its mortgage broker, George Miller, entered into an agreement that required the broker to determine the fair market value of the securities at issue. The court found that the broker-dealer had sufficient discretion in coming to a fair market valuation of the thirty-seven securities and that the auction was reasonable. However, the court held that the transaction did not constitute a \"fair market value\" because it was conducted in good faith compliance with the terms of the repurchase agreements.  The court also held that, in the event of a default, the broker would have to determine whether the securities were worth the broker's pre-judgment interest and whether the broker had sufficient reserves to cover any shortfall.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Miller. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges the broker with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On August 6, 2017, the Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the assets in the escrowed escrow of Bear Street, which is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the broker from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders Miller to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
