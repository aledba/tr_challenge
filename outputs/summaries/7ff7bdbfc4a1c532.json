The final judgment, which was entered on May 2, 2018 and unsealed on May 4, 2019, finds that the court violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that, in a parallel action, the court improperly imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of 11 years on the charge of attempted murder and a three-year sentence of 12 months imprisonment.  In a separate action, on May 5, 2018 the U-S Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Illinois announced criminal charges against Sernas.

The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David Bautista and Carol M. Basinger of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C.

The exam that led Thompson to this conclusion was conducted with the assistance of a mental health professional, and the examination was conducted in conjunction with the examination conducted by the unit's clinical trial team. The trial court concluded that, based on the evidence obtained by the trial court, the defendant was able to complete his sentence on the basis of reasonable and convincing evidence, and that he was capable of distinguishing right from wrong at the time of the alleged crime. The sentencing hearing followed by a hearing on May 17, 2018. The hearing concluded that the defendant had a history of psychosis and had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The jury deliberated for a total of 10 minutes before finding him guilty on all of the charges. The final judgments, which are subject to court approval, order Sern"
