  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against Jeffrey Henry Williamson, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 96 months of imprisonment for threatening to kill an FBI agent.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that, before the sentencing hearing, Williamson made a series of threatening phone calls to an FBI field office, including one in which he repeatedly stated that he would \u201csmash the f\u2014 out of\u201d the agents he believed were harassing him, and \u201cplead not guilty by reason of entrapment.\u201d  The complaint also alleges that Williamson failed to adequately disclose that he had engaged in a pattern of threatening conduct over a period of years for his political activism and that the harassment continued until Williamson made the threatening phone call.  According to the complaint, Williamson then allegedly told the field office that he was going to \"pop them in the heads and blow them away.\"  The court ultimately ruled that Williamson had not violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Williamson arising out of the same conduct alleged in the SEC's action.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, Williamson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 96 months.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 549 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Fort Worth Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in this matter."
