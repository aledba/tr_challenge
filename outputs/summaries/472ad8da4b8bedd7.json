  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered final judgments against Jacqueline Coleman for violating the antifraud provisions of the Kansas Securities and Exchange Commission's (KSTC) securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that Coleman violated the securities laws by failing to disclose that she had been convicted of a prior felony for a person crime.  According to the complaint, Coleman was sentenced to 12 months' probation in 2015 for a previous felony conviction for involuntary manslaughter.  As alleged, Coleman's 2015 conviction was comparable to the earlier felony convictions, but the difference was significant because Coleman was not a person at the time of her 2015 theft convictions.  Coleman's plea, which was filed under seal in the federal district court in Manhattan, charges Coleman with violating the \"wanton\" provision of the KSTC, and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Coleman consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her sentence.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court granted Coleman's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered her to comply with the court's order.  On May 2, 2013, Coleman pleaded guilty to two felony counts of theft after prior convictions were determined by the court to be \"reckless.\"  The court also found that Coleman failed to adequately disclose that her prior felony conviction had been improperly classified as a person felony in the earlier criminal statutes.  To learn more about involuntary manslaughter, see Litigation Release No. 552 (2014).  The complaint also alleges that the court improperly classified Coleman's prior felony convictions as person or nonperson, despite the fact that the previous criminal statute did not require such a classification.   In its order granting Coleman's motion for a preliminary injunction, the Court also ordered Coleman to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a $10,000 civil penalty.  For further information, see Criminal Code Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, 13b2-2, and 13b3-4 thereunder.  It also issued an order requiring Coleman to surrender her passport in the event of an emergency, requiring her to show cause and effect of a criminal conviction, and imposing a $50,000 officer and director bar against her. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing,"
