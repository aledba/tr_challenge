  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of terminating the parental rights of a Tennessee mother and her two children, Johnathan and Jordan M., who were born in March 2009 and June 2011.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, on August 2, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the SEC Court of Appeals found that the mother violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that, contrary to the court's findings, the mother failed to provide reasonable support for or to support the children while incarcerated.  In addition, the court found that Mother violated the anti-fraud provision of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rules 5b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder, and that the court improperly terminated the mother's parental rights.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the judge also ordered the mother to pay a civil penalty of $75,000 and ordered her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $50,000 civil penalty for a second time.  On the same day, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the mother and father of the children.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Tennessee Department of Health and Human Services."
