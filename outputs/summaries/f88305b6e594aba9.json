  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment against Brent Cornman, the former chief executive officer of Cornman Construction, Inc., for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, alleges that, in the fall of 2013, the defendants met with Brent to discuss the possibility of hiring him to build a new home for the plaintiffs. According to the complaint, Brent agreed to build the home in order to induce the plaintiffs to sign a contract that required him to perform certain work related to the construction of the home. The complaint alleges that Brent failed to perform these duties and instead engaged in a pattern of misconduct that was not consistent with the current state of the law. The SEC alleges that the defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and that Brent was liable as an officer, director or shareholder for violations of those provisions.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Brent has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from participating in any future offering of securities. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Brent.  On May 24, 2016, the Honorable Judge William L. Pyszka granted Brent's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered him to comply with the court's order. The court also ordered Brent to pay disgorgement of $2,500 plus prejudgment interest of $7,500, and ordered a temporary restraining order against Brent and a hearing on May 26, 2016. The hearing is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17."
