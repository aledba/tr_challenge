  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against a Clinton, North Carolina man for his role in an online child pornography ring.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Clinton, alleges that, from at least December 2014 through March 2015, a Clinton man was placed on GPS monitoring in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the GPS monitoring provision of Section 265 of the federal securities laws prohibits the imposition of a search warrant without a court-ordered injunction.  In addition, the complaint alleges that GPS monitoring is not a reasonable search because it requires the defendant to maintain a reasonable expectation of privacy in his or her identity.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Finally, the court granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from participating in any future GPS monitoring activities, and ordered him to comply with a court order requiring him to surrender his passport and other documents in order to obtain an attorney.  On May 2, 2020, the U. S. District Court for the Western District of New York entered a final consent judgment against the defendant, finding him liable for violating Section 5(b).  The court also entered a consent judgment in favor of the defendant in this matter, ordering him to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of the alleged ringleader of the ringleader's online child-trafficking ring. The court's order also imposed a $25,000 civil penalty against the convicted ringleader, and a $10,000 bar against the other ringleader in this case.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (2014).  In its continuing investigation, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunction, and the appointment of a receiver.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Criminal Justice and the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit, with assistance from John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Cyber Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice"
