  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of Indiana-based medical laboratory equipment manufacturer Lab Verdict Corp. and its president, Mark Rafman, in a civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on November 10, 2011, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, Indiana, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that defendants used a collection agency to collect an alleged debt from Indiana residents, and that the defendants sent emails and postings on their websites calling for the return of used lab equipment to Indiana residents.  As alleged in the complaint, these posts were meant to deter others from doing business with the out-of-state defendants.  In addition, the complaint alleges the defendants defamed Mr. Johnson by engaging in a concerted campaign of blast emails, postings, and urging others to boycott the defendants' products.  Among other things, the court found sufficient contacts to exercise personal jurisdiction over the defendants because the defendants \"specifically aimed their tortious conduct at Indiana, not just to the Indiana residents.\"  The SEC's Complaint alleges that Defendants intentionally targeted Indiana residents with the intent to harm their reputations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On November 11, 2014, a federal district court in Indiana issued a temporary restraining order against the defendants and ordered them to cease and desist from making materially false and misleading statements to the public in connection with their conduct in the Exchange Act and orders the defendants to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.   The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review of the case. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael Tamburo and supervised by Marc Blau of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Indiana Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Indiana Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
