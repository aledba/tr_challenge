  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Abdiaziz Hussein, finding him liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Lawrence, New Jersey, alleges that, on November 10, 2017, an officer with the Lewiston Police Department went to Hussein's apartment to serve him a criminal summons. According to the complaint, Hussein refused to sign the summons, repeatedly saying that he would sign it, and that he had run from the officer and was \"flailing and fighting violently\" as the officer attempted to arrest him. The complaint further alleges that the officer repeatedly told Hussein that the summons simply established a court date for Hussein and that signing it was not an admission of guilt. In fact, the complaint alleges, the officer had kicked Hussein in the face and kicked him in the head. The SEC alleges that Hussein, who was arrested on the same day, had a pen in his hand when the officer entered the apartment and kicked the officer several times. The court ultimately found Hussein guilty of all three of the charges and ordered him to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hussein has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $500,000, and imposing an officer-and-director bar. The judgment also orders Hussein to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $150,000 and a $50,000 civil penalty.  On July 19, 2018, the court entered a judgment against Hussein that permanently enjoins him from participating in future securities law violations, orders him to surrender to the SEC, and orders him be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The order also prohibits him from associating with any third party, including a broker or investment adviser, and from using the internet to make personal purchases.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Hussein. The case is being handled by John R. Rymas of the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The litigation will be led by Kenneth S. Broun and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter."
