  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Starkey Laboratories, Inc., a Minnesota-based hearing aid manufacturer, and its former CEO, Jerry Ruzicka, in a parallel action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Texas on April 6, 2018, Austin and Starkey violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Austin violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and Section\u00c2\u00a010(b)(2) and Rule\u00c2\u00a017(a)(3) thereunder of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Austin consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court entered a temporary restraining order against Austin and ordered him to comply with the court's order, ordering him to show cause and effect, and to provide a copy of the complaint to the court for further determination by the court upon motion of the SEC.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Office of Inspector General, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.
