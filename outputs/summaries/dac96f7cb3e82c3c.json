  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Cash Biz, LP, Redwood Financial, LLC, and Cash Zone, LLC d/b/a Cash Zone that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000.  The court also granted the parties the right to compel arbitration.  According to the court's order, the Borrowing Parties filed a complaint in federal district court in Texas on January 30, 2015, alleging that cash biz illegally and wrongfully used the criminal justice system to collect payday loans through the wrongful filing of criminal charges and pursued criminal charges against its customers in violation of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, on March 2, 2016, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York unsealed criminal charges related to the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  As alleged, the complaint also alleges that Cash biz violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and the books and records provision of Section 15(b)(2)(A) and 15(c)(3)(B) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 12b2-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Cash and Redwood have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requiring Cash to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount owed to them by the court.  Cash also agreed to pay disgorgement of $10,000, which is the amount it has already paid to settle the case.  On March 4, 2017, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, and ordered Cash to comply with the court order.  At a hearing on March 5, 2017 the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the U. S. District court for the Central District of California granted the request for a temporary asset freeze, ordered the issuance of a civil injunctive relief, and issued an order suspending the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any security that may be necessary to enforce the agreed-upon provisions of the arbitration provision.   The SEC also issued a subpoena and other emergency relief, including an order appointing an independent receiver to facilitate the investigation of the alleged violations. "
