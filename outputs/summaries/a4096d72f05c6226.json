  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a New York City man accused of driving a Dodge Durango into the path of a Toyota Highlander.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, on August 14, 2013, Carly Rahal, 22 years old at the time of the accident, was driving the Durango when she was hit by the vehicle.  The complaint alleges that, before the collision, the defendant's vehicle entered the parkway's median and entered the right lane.  As alleged in the complaint, after the impact, the driver's vehicle passed through the middle of the two lanes and into the median, causing Rahal to lose control of the vehicle and hit a tree.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Rahal consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her disgorgement plus prejudgment interest in the matter.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a judgment against Rahal and ordered her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains plus interest and pay a civil penalty of $10,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David Tully and Eric Kaplan of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Kaplan.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Pennsylvania Office of Insurance Regulation."
