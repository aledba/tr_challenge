  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida yesterday entered a final judgment against the Florida Department of Health and Human Services (DOH) in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, alleges that the DOH violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(3) of the Florida Administrative Code (GAAs) and Rules 206(4)-8 thereunder, and that the agency failed to adopt a recurring methodology for calculating hospital outpatient reimbursement rates.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to the GAAs, the agency did not adopt a consistent methodology for establishing reimbursement rates for Medicaid outpatient hospital services.  According to the complaint, the Agency's methodologies were not consistent with the reporting requirements of the federal government, and the agency was unable to implement any recurring methodology as required by GAAs.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, DOH consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the agency from violating the federal, state, and local reporting requirements, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $16,796,807.00. The final order also prohibits the Agency from requiring it to implement a recurring method for calculating the hospital's rate reductions.  DOH also agreed to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any health care product for a specified period of time and requires the agency to provide timely and accurate information about the patient's progress.  Additionally, the final order orders the agency not to exceed its reporting requirements and requires it to use the available information to determine whether it has complied with GAAs and Rule 206(6)-8. The agency is also prohibited from imposing a percentage-based rate reduction on a patient based on his or her medical condition.   The court's order, which was entered yesterday, reserves the issue of whether the agency violated the reporting provisions of GAAs or the reporting provision of the GAA and orders the Agency to use a \"recurring methodology\" to determine the effect of the MTA reductions on patient rates. The court also ordered the Agency not to overpay for services performed by third-party Medicaid managed care plans, which are not subject to the grant of agency discretion.  For example, the SEC previously issued an order requiring that certain hospitals and clinics be audited in order to determine if they had complied with the agency's reporting requirements. The SEC also instituted a new rule that requires hospitals to submit annual reports to the agency that show that they have complied with its reporting provisions.  As a result of the new rule, hospitals can expect to receive more than $1.5 million in reimbursement per year."
