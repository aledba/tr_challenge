  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Florida woman accused of purchasing oxycodone pills from dealers.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that Karen Potter, who was arrested on May 13, 2016, was a drug dealer and would purchase the pills from a dealer.  According to the complaint, Potter split up her prescription pills, placing some of the pills in a Walgreens prescription bottle with the label removed, and leaving the rest in Bailey\u2019s purse.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, Potter did not have a valid 2014 prescription, and she did not use the prescription bottle to purchase the oxycodones.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, while the police were conducting the search of the apartment, Potter allegedly split up the prescription pills and placed some of them in Bailey's purse, leaving the remainder in the original, valid prescription bottle.  Potter also allegedly told the officers that she had had a funny feeling before we had got arrested that something bad was going to happen when she bought the oxycone pills.  Finally, the SEC alleges that Potter violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Potter consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Additionally, Potter agreed to cooperate with the SEC with the assistance of the Office of the United States Attorney for the Central District of Florida, and to cooperate in the investigation of the matter.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Potter to surrender her passport and other personal information.   The court also granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction, which requires Potter to show cause and effect, including a copy of the court order, that she has not violated the registration provision of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and that the court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Miami Regional Office."
