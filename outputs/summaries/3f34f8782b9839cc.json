  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against two individuals for their roles in a fraudulent scheme to steal Native American tribal recognition.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants misrepresented to the SEC that Native American tribes were members of a \"collective\" of tribes, and that the tribe was not a part of a collective.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to adequately consider the evidence presented in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, which was filed in the federal district court for the district of Massachusetts, and failed to consider the fact that the complaint was filed on behalf of a tribe that had not yet been recognized as an American Indian tribe.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's Order, the Defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Section 83.7 of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The Commission's order also prohibits the defendants from violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of an order appointing a receiver of Native American tribe claims to be a member of a recognized tribe, including the Nipmuc Tribe.  It also prohibits defendants from associating with any non-Indigenous person, including members of any tribe, other than members of the Hassanamisco Tribe, or members of other non-indigenous communities.  For example, the Commission has not issued a final determination on whether the tribe is entitled to tribal recognition under the federal   \u00c2\u00a0regardless of whether it has any historical affiliation with a tribe.\u00c2\u00a0The Commission has also not issued an order requiring the receiver to provide any additional information about the tribe to determine whether it is a legitimate tribe, such as whether there is any historical basis for the tribe's claims, and whether there are any historical ties to the tribe. The Commission also has not appointed a receiver to determine if the tribe qualifies as a tribe"
