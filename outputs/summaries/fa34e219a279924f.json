  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against a Mississippi man convicted of sexually abusing a five-year-old.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Cody L. Pitts violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Pitts told the jury that he had been sexually abused by his mother, Janice, and that Pitts had told him not to tell anyone because he would get into \u201cvery big trouble.\u201d  The complaint further alleges that the trial judge improperly instructed the jury on how to weigh Billy's out-of-court statements, which were consistent with a child that had been victimized by a predator.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in a parallel action, the Mississippi Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Pitts, charging him with violating Section 97-5-23 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of ten years, day for day, without the possibility of parole or early release, and requires him to register as a sex offender upon his release from prison.  On March 13, 2018, the court granted Pitts's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to surrender his passport and be barred from associating with anyone other than his mother and Janice. The court also ordered Pitts to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil monetary penalty of five years.  To learn more about how to deal with a jury, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Feb. 24, 2019)."
