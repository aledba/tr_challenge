  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the California Department of Industrial Relations, which found that Vector Resources, Inc. (Vector), failed to pay the appropriate prevailing wages to its workers on a public works project for the San Diego Unified School District.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, California, Vector failed to comply with the prevailing wage laws.  The complaint alleges that the Department of Labor determined that Vector underpaid its employees by failing to pay a higher \u201cshift differential\u201d rate for work performed during shifts commencing after 12:00 noon.  As alleged in the complaint, the Department's prevailing wage determination was based on regulatory language in a document entitled \u201cImportant Notice to Awarding Bodies and Other Interested Parties Regarding Shift Differential Pay in the Public Works Project.\u201d  The document also contains a \" Stamp\" that the department places on the cover page of prevailing wage determinations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Vector and the Department have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1773 of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  In addition, the court granted the Commission's motion for summary judgment, which is subject to court approval, for a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Finally, the Commission agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins Vector from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders the Commission to conduct a hearing on the matter, and orders the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSA) to conduct an independent examination of the matter. The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Marc Blau. The SEC's litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
