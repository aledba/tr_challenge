  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin yesterday entered a final judgment against Christopher Mason, Jr., a Wisconsin resident, for two counts of identity theft.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison, Wis., alleges that, in 2014, Mason was convicted of two identity theft counts.  According to the complaint, Mason presented a credit or debit card for payment, which he knew was not his and that he was not authorized to use, and used a credit card to obtain gasoline at a Mobil gas station, both times without the knowledge or authorization of the cardholder. The complaint further alleges that Mason used the credit and debit card as payment for the gas and food at a Burger King restaurant, and then drove up to a pay-window and used the card to make the Burger King purchase at the same time.  Mason also allegedly used the debit and credit card for the same purpose, but the complaint alleges that he did not present the cards as payment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mason.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Paul J. McCole granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Mason, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  McCole also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any financial transaction card. The court also ordered Mason to pay disgorgement of $5,000, prejudgment interest of $1,500, and a $100,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s action, Mason consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, as well as an order requiring the issuance of a civil injunctive relief, an order appointing a receiver, and the appointment of a receiver for the purpose of recovering stolen property.  To settle the SEC case, Mason agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
