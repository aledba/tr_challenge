  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered final judgments against The Travis Law Firm, P.C., and Porter-Garcia, both of whom have been charged by the Texas Workforce Commission with fraud and theft.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that, from at least September 2014 through September 2015, Porter and Martin violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that Porter-garcia and Martin failed to establish by clear and specific evidence that they were entitled to paid time-off, and failed to make up the missed work time. The SEC alleges that the defendants violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws by failing to establish a prima facie case of fraud or theft. The defendants also allegedly violated the pre-judgment provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(2)(A) the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-6 thereunder, and that they violated the registration provision of Section 5 of the Exchange Act. In addition, the complaint alleges that Martin violated Section 13(d) and 13(e) of Exchange Act Rule 13d-1 and Rule 13e-2 thereunder and that the complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against Porter, Martin, and Porter. The case is being handled by Eric R. Werner and Glenn S. Gordon of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner, Ms. Gordon, and Ms. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Attorney General's Office in this matter."
