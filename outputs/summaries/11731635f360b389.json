  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against Lorenzo Fondzel Brooks, a judgment of acquittal for first degree burglary.  The court also entered a judgment against Brooks on a second-degree burglary charge.  According to the court's order, Brooks, who was previously convicted in a similar case, entered a guilty verdict on the second degree burglary charge and was sentenced to three years in the custody of the Department of Corrections on the remaining charges.  In its judgment, the court found that Brooks violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Brooks agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Without admitting or denying the findings of the court, Brooks consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, ordering him to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit, and from making any investment in a home or business that may be deemed to be of interest to a security deposit recipient.    In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Brooks arising from the same conduct alleged in the criminal case.  On January 24, 2019, the U. S. District Judge in Denver issued a temporary restraining order against Brooks and ordered him to surrender his passport and be enjoined from future securities law violations. \u00c2\u00a0The court also issued a preliminary injunction against Brooks, ordering Brooks to pay disgorgement of $2,965, which is approximately twice the amount Brooks was previously ordered to pay.  A parallel criminal proceeding was conducted in the parallel criminal case against Brooks by the Colorado State Attorney General's Office, which also conducted an examination of Brooks' criminal history. The SEC's investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, the FBI, the Colorado Department of Justice, and the FBI in this matter."
