  "summary": "On April 1, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (\"Walgreens\"), an Illinois-based manufacturer of bottled water.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, since 2008, the City of Chicago has charged a five-cent tax on the purchase of water that was exempt from taxation under the federal bottled water tax.  According to the complaint, in 2015, the city charged the tax on retail sales of carbonated, flavored, and mineral water that were exempt from the tax. In 2016, the complaint alleged that, in a deceptive course of conduct by the defendant, the company improperly charged the bottled water price on exempt purchases from a municipal tax. The complaint further alleged that the overcharge was inconspicuous because only a close inspection and investigation of the applicable tax rates and the specific tax charged by the company would reveal the overcharged price.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On April 24, 2018 the U-S District Judge in Chicago granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The court's order, which is subject to court approval, reserves the issues of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty for further determination by the court upon motion of the SEC. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 24, 2019).

The Commission is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, a conduct-based injunction, a penny stock bar, an officer and director bar, and other emergency relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the charged"
