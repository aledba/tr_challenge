  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Charles S. and Marian V. of Valdez, Washington, permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Seattle, alleges that Charles and Marian violated Section 47.10.011 of the federal securities laws by failing to adequately supervise their three children.  According to the complaint, the complaint also alleges that the parents failed to adequately protect the children from Charles\u2019s substance abuse and mental health issues.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington today announced criminal charges against Charles.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, Charles, Marian, and their four children, Maya, Sierra, and Chase, were in OCS custody for three years when Charles was arrested by the agency for his alleged involvement in a domestic violence case.  Charles, who has been sober since January 2015, has been diagnosed with anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and reactive attachment disorder.   The complaint further alleges that Marian failed to provide sufficient support to the children and to maintain contact with the children, despite repeated requests from the agency to do a case plan.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Charles has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 47, 10(b)(5) and 13(a)(2)(A) and provides that the court will consider the merits of the case upon motion of the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  Separately, the Department of Health and Social Services today announced that it has issued an order suspending Charles from participating in the agency's child-rearing program.  On August 2, 2018, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered Charles to return to the agency with the assistance of an officer and director of a community mental health facility.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Children and Family Education and the case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Family Education.  A hearing on August 13, 2018 was conducted by David A. Kasper and Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office, with assistance from John R. Rymas of the Public Health Abuse Unit, and supervised by Scott A."
