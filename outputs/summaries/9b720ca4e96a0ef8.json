  "summary": "On June 15, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against MediMarts, Inc., a San Jose, California-based medical marijuana collective, and its president, David Armstrong, in an emergency action to halt the company's operations.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Armstrong violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, Armstrong was not entitled to a penny-per-trick exemption from the federal securities laws, and that he was not required to pay the $58,788.53 tax owed under the exchange.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Armstrong consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating Section 5, and orders him to pay $767,058.60 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $215,111.17.  In a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Armstrong.  On July 11, 2014, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office announced that it had obtained a temporary restraining order against Armstrong from violating the federal anti-fraud provisions, including Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the San Francisco Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, and the California Office of Financial Regulation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Department of Justice has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint to the California Secretary of State's Office, seeking a preliminary injunction against the issuance, purchase, offer and sale of any medical marijuana product, and an order requiring the issuance of a Form 10-K. The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction against Armstrong, a civil monetary penalty, and other relief.   The case is being supervised by C.J."
