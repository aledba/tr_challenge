  "summary": "On May 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against Lamar Advertising Company, Inc., a Los Angeles-based advertising company, for violating the federal and state advertising laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that Lamar violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5412 of the California Department of Transportation, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Regulation 2270. The complaint also alleges that, in 2008, Lamar replaced the billboard face and support structures with a new design that was not \"customary maintenance\" and was not subject to local permitting requirements. In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2009, Lamar's re-erection of the billboard was not permitted under the state law, because it was not part of the commercial billboard exclusion zone. In 2010, Lamar appealed the District Court's order, finding that it was entitled to rebuild the billboard without compensation, and that Lamar had to submit a nonconforming review application to the County of Monterey for approval. In 2016, Lamar filed a civil injunctive action against the County, alleging that it violated the federal, state, and local permitting laws. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered Lamar to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and issued a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Lamar. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Los Angeles County Office of Inspector General, and the California Office of Inspections and Examinations, which has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of investing in advertising billboards.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling them by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0Among other things, the SEC encourages investors to use\u00c2\u00a0investors'\u00c2\u00a0instant funds to make\u00c2\u00a0informed decisions about whether to invest in\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0adviser\u00c2\u00a0program\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0may be\u00c2\u00a0used\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0a\u00c2\u00a0business\u00c2\u00a0regardless of the cost and time limitations."
