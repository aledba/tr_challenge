  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii today entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of Briandalynne Castro, a mother of a stillborn fetus who died in prison.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 6, 2008, filed in the U.K. District court for the Central District of Hawai'i, Castro, an attorney, and two correctional officers, Debra Pimental and Ted Choy Foo, raised the issue of whether a viable fetus could recover loss of enjoyment of life damages.  The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rule 206(3) and (4) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of $250,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Mark Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Bhalang. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services."
