  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon for his role in a federal child-pornography investigation.  According to the court's order, on January 22, 2016, David Wright, a resident of Hartford City, Indiana, was arrested and charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court found that Wright violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by failing to disclose that he had engaged in a search and seizure that resulted in the discovery of child pornography on his computer.  Wright consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Wright agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the federal, state, and local securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Wright.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Indianapolis, charges Wright with violating Sections 9(a)(1) and 9(b)(2)(A) and (3)(B)(3) and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On January 24, 2017, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Wright and ordered him to surrender his computer equipment, surrender those devices, and remain away from the scene of the alleged crime. The court also granted the request for an asset freeze and an officer-and-director bar.
