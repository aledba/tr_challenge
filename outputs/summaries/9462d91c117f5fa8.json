  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment in favor of the City of Seattle against Officer Hinson, who was not certified as an expert in field sobriety tests.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, alleges that Hinson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hinson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Hinson also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hinson.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, in April 2015, the Seattle Police Department conducted an emergency response to a motor vehicle accident that resulted in the death of a motorcyclist. The emergency response team responded to the scene of the accident and found Levesque unable to drive. The SEC alleges that the officer who performed the emergency response was not qualified to provide an opinion on the severity of the impairment, and that he failed to provide a reasonable basis for his opinion. The complaint charges Hinson with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act Section 17(b)(5) of The Exchange Act and Rules 17a-14, 13a-15, and 13a2-1 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future. The court also ordered Hinson to cooperate with the investigation, which is continuing.  A hearing for the SEC is scheduled for May 17, 2018.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 5, 2017."
