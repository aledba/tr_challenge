  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment in favor of the parole board's motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of certain individuals, and ordering the release of others.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Board of Parole and Probation and Parole issued an order suspending the asset freeze and other emergency relief provisions of Section 6138 of the Parole Code. The order temporarily froze assets held by certain parole violators, including those who had been re-instituted as a CPV. In addition, the order permanently froze the assets held in the escrow account of a convicted felon who was recommitted as a TPV during a prior period of parole. The court's order also temporarily froze asset freeze provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c). The SEC's order, which was entered in a parallel administrative proceeding, prohibits the Board from suspending or freezing assets of any parole violator for a specified period of time, including time spent in good standing while on parole. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the board has agreed to a permanent injunction and to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The Court also granted the Board's request for an expedited hearing on the merits of the case.  In its order, the court also issued an emergency order suspending asset freeze provision of Section 5(b).  The Court's order freezes assets held held in escrow accounts.  The court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the court. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General in this matter.
