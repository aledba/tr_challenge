  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against James Hiller in contempt of court for violating the antifraud provisions of a court order.  The court found that James had the ability to comply with the court\u2019s order to pay $11,493.48 in attorney fees to Jennifer and $4,082 in expert witness fees.  According to the court order, filed on July 8, 2016, James was ordered to prepare and deliver a quitclaim deed for an undivided 1/64th interest in a parcel of his farm property.  As alleged in the order, however, that James was unable to pay the attorney fees because he was a strong-willed teenager who unilaterally refused to attend visits when he was required to do so.  In addition, the court ruled that James could \u201cpurge\u201d himself of contempt by paying attorney fees when he disagreed with the underlying court order and ordered him to participate in a custody evaluation with Dr. Gretchen Hartmann.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, James consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay attorney fees, and requires him to provide an accounting of the amount of attorney fees that he has already paid to Jennifer, and orders James to pay a civil penalty of $5,000.  James also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On August 2, 2018, a federal district court in New York granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against James and ordered the court to determine whether to issue an order imposing a civil injunction against James, ordering the issuance of a cease-and-desist order, and ordering the payment of civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges James with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against James.  To settle the SEC case, James agreed to a settlement in which he would pay $6,500 in disgorging and prejudgment interests, plus a $1,500 civil penalty, and to be restrained from participating in any court-ordered family reunification therapy.  He agreed to the settlement, which is subject to court approval.  A hearing on August 13, 2018"
