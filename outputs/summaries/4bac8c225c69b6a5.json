  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of a Florida man who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for a second-degree murder he committed when he was a juvenile.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that defendant Joshua Phillips violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Phillips, who was 14 years old at the time, was the rare juvenile offender who did not commit a serious crime and was not subject to the mandatory minimum sentence required by the federal securities laws.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, that Phillips violated Section 921.1401 of the United States Constitution.  In its judgment, the court found that Phillips was entitled to a presumption of constitutionality because he had proven himself to be neither incorrigible, irredeemable, nor corrupt, and that he had the right to a sentence review after twenty-five years of incarceration.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint or otherwise, Phillips consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal criminal laws and orders him to pay a penalty of life without parole, subject to a court-ordered injunction, and bars him from participating in any form of pre-judgmental or disciplinary proceeding.  Phillips also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years.  On November 10, 2018, the Florida Court of Appeals issued an order imposing a preliminary injunction against Phillips and ordering him to comply with the court's order.
