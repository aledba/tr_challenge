  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against the Corps of Engineers in a related case.  The court entered the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, which alleges that the Corps violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its order, the court also entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the Corps and ordering the issuance of a nationwide permit for shellfish aquaculture.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Seattle on October 30, 2019, the Corps failed to adequately evaluate the impact of shellfish-aquaculture activities on the environment and the potential impacts on the wider aquatic ecosystem. The court also ordered the Corps to comply with the federal environmental laws, including the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and the requirements of Section 13(b)(5)(A) and 13(c)(3)(B)(2)(A). The court granted the Corps' motion for summary judgment on the merits of the case, and ordered the agency to provide an accounting of the material and cumulative impacts of the permitted shellfish activities.  On October 31, the Court granted the Commission's request for a preliminary injunction, ordered an accounting, and issued an order appointing a receiver to determine the appropriate timing and amount of dredging and fill material to be used in the application of the federal permit. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.
