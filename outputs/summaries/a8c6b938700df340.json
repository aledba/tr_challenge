  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the appellee Holiday Island Suburban Improvement District #1 (HISID) for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Little Rock, Arkansas, on October 19, 2015, the court found that the property owners of the timeshare units were not property owners as contemplated by Arkansas Code Annotated section 14-92-201(3)(Repl. 1998) and therefore were not entitled to receive individual notice of upcoming elections for commissioners or to receive ballots to vote in the election.  The court also found that HISID had failed to provide absentee ballots to certain timeshare owners, and had improperly restricted their voting rights to one collective vote.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, HISID consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Arkansas today announced criminal charges against the defendants.   The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0report\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0successor of\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0their investments.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J.
