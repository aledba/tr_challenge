  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against two New Bedford men for their roles in a 2013 armed robbery that left Sharone Stafford seriously injured.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Samir Baptista and Antonio Rodrigues, along with another defendant, Antonio Mendes, engaged in an armed robbery in the parking lot of a New Bedford sports club on November 23, 2013. According to the complaint, Baptista used \"crack\" cocaine in the course of the robbery to convince the victim that he had just shot someone with a shotgun. The complaint further alleges that DaCosta told Baptista that he was going to rob other drug dealers to \"get the[m] off the streets\" and that he planned to use a gun to commit the crime. The SEC alleges that Baptista's testimony, which was corroborated by testimony from the victim's family members, was not supported by the evidence presented to the jury. In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Baptista, ordering him to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Rodrigues to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of the case. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered Baptista to surrender his passport, and ordered Mendes to pay a civil penalty of $250,000. The defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay civil penalties of $150,000, and requires them to be barred from serving as officers or directors of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted a parallel criminal investigation. The case is being handled by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Mascianica of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office in this matter."
