  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment in favor of Brooke Dixon Littlefield, a Mississippi woman who was recently separated from her husband.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi on February 5, 2018, alleges that, during their five-year marriage, Eddie and Brooke Littlefield were married in 2012 and had no children from the marriage. According to the complaint, Eddie allegedly used religion to manipulate Brooke and control their relationship.  In one instance, the complaint alleges that Eddie allegedly demanded that Brooke relinquish her right to most of the marital and disputed property, including a 2007 Infiniti, which the chancellor awarded to Eddie on the basis of adultery with prejudice.  As the complaint further alleges, Eddie also allegedly threatened to stop taking care of all the couple's pets and to set all of the pets loose in the backyard, an act that the chancellor deemed untimely.  After the divorce proceedings were over, Brooke and Eddie filed for divorce on the ground of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment or, in the alternative, for irreconcilable differences.  On November 9, 2017, the chancellor entered his opinion and final judgment, finding that Eddie violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Eddie has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval, and the court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by James Shelson and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter in the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Shelson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Mississippi Office of Financial Regulation."
