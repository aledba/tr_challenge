  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of Azusa, its municipal utility, and the successor agency to its redevelopment agency.  The court found that the City violated the federal and state contracts provisions of the Community Redevelopment Law by failing to recognize as enforceable certain obligations of the city's former redevelopment agency, the Utility.  According to the court's order, the City's claims arise from the fact that the Utility loaned money to the RDA, which was required to repay the loans, to the city.  As alleged in its complaint, the city alleges that the loan was not required to be repaid, and that the repayment of the loans did not result in any tax increase.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, once repaid, the loan became an RDA asset, and therefore was subject to legislative disposition.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, however, the Commission of Inspections and Examinations has issued an order suspending the issuance of the Commission's Order and ordering the Commission to conduct an independent examination of the borrower's books and records and to determine whether to issue an order imposing a civil injunctive proceeding against the Commission. The Commission's order also prohibits the City from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and prohibits the Commission from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer in connection with the issuance or sale of any municipal bonds or municipal securities.  Finally, the court ruled that the Commission has a duty to protect the interests of ratepayers, including the right to reapply as a trustee of the municipal bonds and municipal securities at a later date.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the city from future violations of the federal, state, and local securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amounts to be determined by the Commission upon its motion. The court also ordered the Commission not to violate the anti-fraud provision of the Public Finance Abuse and Education Act of 1940, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  A hearing on May 24, 2019 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m."
