  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Phillip L. Clapp for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder. The court found that Clapp violated his probation, revoked his probation and imposed an additional 60-day prison sanction on a second-time violator. According to the court's order, Clapp failed to comply with the requirements of the probation revocation provisions of the federal criminal code and was instead ordered to serve a 180-day sentence in the Department of Corrections and be reinstated as a probation violator for a second probation violation. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the court granted Clapp's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar. The SEC's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins Clapp from violating the probation provision and orders him to serve the remainder of his sentence. The final judgment orders Clapp to pay the $1.2 million civil penalty, imposes a 90-day jail sanction, and requires him to complete a job search and obtain employment. The Court of Appeals also ordered Clapp not to participate in any probation revocation scheme, including participating in any peer-to-peer counseling program, participating in a community correctional services program, or any other supervised release program, and requiring him to attend recommended mental health treatment.  The court's final order also prohibits the issuance of a subpoena or other emergency relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Clapp. The case was investigated by the Office of Inspector General's Criminal Justice, which issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage people to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-3716(c)(1).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Office of Financial Regulation in this matter."
