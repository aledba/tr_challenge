  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against Michael J. Nissen for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 875(c) of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that, on November 2, 2018, a Texas man made a series of threatening phone calls on the internet, including one in which he allegedly told an FBI agent that he would \"unload six bullets into\" a federal law enforcement officer's brain.  According to the complaint, the FBI agent had just given him several citations for making such a threat, and the defendant replied, \"You guys got some of the stupidest fucking pigs on the road.\"  The complaint further alleges that the defendant told the agent that \"if you break into my house you know I will kill you\" and \"I'm gonna take my revolver out and put that motherfucker drop dead.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On May 28, 2019, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an asset freezing order.  In its order granting the court's request, the SEC also issued an order suspending the issuance of an emergency court order, freezing the assets of the defendant, and imposing a civil injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint or the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The court also ordered the defendant to pay disgorgement of $2,500, which is equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively. The SEC also requested a temporary asset freeze and a permanent conduct-based injunction against further violations of the anti-fraud provision of Section 10(b) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court consider the merits of the proposed asset freeze as part of its jurisdiction over the case.  Finally, the Court granted the request for the asset freeze.  A hearing scheduled for August 5, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. EST.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2019.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Schiff and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Schiff."
