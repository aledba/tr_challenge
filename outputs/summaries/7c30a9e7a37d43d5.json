  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against two insurance companies for their failure to procure insurance coverage for a trucking business.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Richmond, Virginia, alleges that 1st Southern Insurance Services, Inc. (collectively \"Barker\") and its owner, George Roberts, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants were aware that Barker & Son had a history of failing to provide insurance and therefore relied entirely on the defendants and their promised expertise for the selection and placement of insurance.  As set forth in the Complaint, however, that the defendants' reliance arose, at least in part, from Defendants' claimed experience in insuring truckers.  For example, the complaint alleges that, under the terms of the Exchange Act, the insurers had to provide at least $750,000 in liability coverage when, in fact, they had not provided that coverage.

Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's judgment, the parties consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $2,450,000 plus prejudgment interest of $650,000, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the judgment orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $250,000 each.  On August 2, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants, and ordered the payment of civil penalties in the amount of $150,000 and a $50,000 civil penalty, respectively.   The court's order also prohibits the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any insurance policy, and prohibits them from making any misrepresentations or omissions to the Commission as to the nature of any injury or damage to the insurance policy.  Finally, the Court has issued an order requiring the Commission to consider whether to issue an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of receivership of the receiver's receivership, ordering the receiver to provide a copy of the receivership order to the receiver, and imposing a $75,000 bar against each receiver. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission has also issued an Order appointing a Receiver for the Receiver of"
