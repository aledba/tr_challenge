  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of South Carolina today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon for his role in a drug-trafficking scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that John Ross, a reserve deputy for the Pickens County Sheriff's Office, illegally obtained and sold pseudoephedrine in the form of \"cookies.\"  According to the complaint, Ross and his co-defendants, Jason Mealor, Daniel Ray Hurley, and Cynthia Greenfield, allegedly made methamphetamine from the substance in question.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Mealor and Greenfield allegedly used a method called \"one pot\" to make methamphetamine, which is a chemical method used to produce methamphetamine.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Mealor had been trained in the manufacturing of methamphetamine and had been involved in the seizure of hundreds of thousands of grams of methamphetamine.&nbsp;  The complaint further alleges that one of the defendants had been convicted of possession of the substance and sentenced to nine years in prison.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the court held that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Mealor also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Additionally, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $250,000, ordering Mealor to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, and ordering Greenfield to pay prejudgment interest in the matter.   The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, and requiring them to provide a copy of the Exchange Act to be sent to the court as part of a case-by-case review.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-20, July 17, 2018.  Separately, the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against Mealor."
