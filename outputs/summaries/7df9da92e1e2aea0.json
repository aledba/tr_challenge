  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma yesterday entered final judgments in a civil injunctive action against a former general laborer who was injured in an automobile accident.  The Court of Appeals held that, contrary to the court's findings, Jesse J. Atkins was not injured while working on a crew that was reroofing a grain elevator in Enid, Oklahoma.  According to the Court's order, Atkins was injured while walking from a bar to his hotel room in the middle of the night and was unable to assume any of the duties of his employment.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Atkins.  On January 7, 2015, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Atkins to return to work on a full-time basis.  At the time of his injury, Atkins had become a \"fixed-situs\" employee who had established a temporary residence at the Baymont Inn.  As a result of his injuries, Atkins lost vision in his right eye and underwent several skin grafts.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Atkins consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $25,000, which is equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 civil penalty.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 595 (2009).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott L. Gibson, John R. Rymas, and Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Kansas Division of Insurance, and the case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Department of Labor, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kansas State Department of Health, the Oklahoma Department of Insurance and the Kansas Secretary of State's Office."
