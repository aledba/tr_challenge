  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against Fedor P. Pakhnyuk, a resident of Chicago, Illinois, in a civil injunctive action brought by the Minnesota Department of Justice.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Minneapolis, alleges that, in July 2012, when he visited his brother's home in Shakopee, Illinois to help his brother with some work, he made several crude and unsophisticated peeping comments to four friends who were watching a movie together. As alleged in the complaint, the defendants entered the home through a window and peeped through the window, which is where the intent to intrude upon or interfere with the privacy of another person resides. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5(a) of the federal securities laws, including Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and Section 10(b) of Exchange Act Rule 10b2-1 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against PakhNYuk.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on May 29, 2012, in the U. S. District Judge's Office in the District of Columbia, Pakhsyuk was convicted of interference with privacy in the home of a relative or friend, and sentenced to prison for five years. The court found that, based on the facts of the case, the defendant did not forfeit his statutory interpretation, and that he was not liable for any monetary penalty. In addition, the court ruled that the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy at the time of entering the home and that the statute required the defendant to show reasonable intent when he entered the property. The Court also ruled that, on the other hand, that he had a duty to protect the safety and well-being of his brother.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court of the SEC, the state consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions, and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer and director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 31, 2013, the SEC issued a subpoena for a copy of the subpoena, which was unsealed on May 4, 2013. The subpoena is pending final approval by the court."
