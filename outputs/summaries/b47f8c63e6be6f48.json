  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware today entered a final judgment in favor of Univar, Inc. (\"Univar\"), a publicly-traded company that claims to hold over $104 million in unclaimed property.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Delaware, alleges that, since 2013, the State of Delaware has engaged Kelmar as a third-party auditor to audit the company's books and records.  According to the complaint, Kelmar is a self-interested party in the audit process, which is intended to determine whether a company is entitled to a right to an audit.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Kelmar has a significant financial state in the outcome of an audit and is not a neutral party in determining whether a claim is ripe for adjudication.  For example, according to the SEC's Complaint, from October 2015 through March 2018, when Kelmar solicited additional states to audit, he failed to show that he had any reasonable expectation that the audit would be conducted by a neutral third party.  As a result, the Complaint alleges, Univar has not been able to meet its obligations under the federal antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties.  Separately, the Court entered a temporary restraining order against Kelmar, ordering him to comply with the court's order.  On May 31, 2018, the court entered a Final Judgment in the case against Univar that permanently enjoins Kelmar from violating the antifascism provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and orders the company to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and requires the auditor to provide a copy of the complaint to the court in a timely manner.  Additionally, the order prohibits the auditor from participating in an audit unless he or she has a reasonable expectation of compliance with the audit, and prohibits the auditing of unclaimed properties by third parties.   The court also issued an order requiring the auditors to submit to the auditor an accounting of the audited company's assets, which would determine whether the auditor had sufficient assets to perform the audit.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office."
