  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Jacob K. Sloan, a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison on two felony counts of resisting arrest and one count of third-degree assault of a corrections officer.  The court also found that Sloan was a dangerous offender due to his prior felony conviction.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, Missouri, Sloan resisted arrest by using violence or physical force, which resulted in serious physical injury to one officer, and knowingly striking another officer. The complaint alleges that, as a result of his resisting arrest, Sloan was not a \"dangerous offender\" and was subject to an enhanced range of punishment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Sloan arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC Complaint.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Snyder granted the SEC\u2019s request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against Sloan.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Sloan consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,500.   The SEC also instituted an administrative proceeding against Sloan, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively.  Sloan also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including in the purchase, sale, or promotion of a security deposit. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 558.016.4, a conduct-based injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against him.  To settle the SEC case, Sloan has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, including, without limitation, the issuance of a civil injunctive relief, disgorgement of his already-convicted gains, and an officer and director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 558-016-4."
