  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5(b)(2) of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C. on February 11, 2019, alleges that the EPA violated Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and that the agency failed adequately to consider the relative qualifications of potential members of its advisory committees.  According to the complaint, as a result of the directive, the EPA's advisory committees were not adequately represented to the court.  In addition, the complaint alleges that EPA failed to adequately consider the qualifications of members of the advisory committees, and failed to consider whether they were \"fairly balanced\" and \"inappropriately influenced\" by the agency's decisions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the agency agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to appoint a permanent director of the agency. The final judgment also orders the agency to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On February 13, 2019 the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the agency, charging the agency with violating Section 5, the securities laws, and the reporting provisions of Sections 5, 5, and 17(a)(1) and (3) and of Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"). The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Feb. 18, 2019).
