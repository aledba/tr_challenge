  "summary": "On June 6, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment against Boca Raton, Florida residents Gerald Gagliardi and Kathleen MacDougall in a civil injunctive action against the city for improperly approving site development plans for the Chabad of East Boca.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, Florida, the city issued an emergency order halting construction of a religious center at the site of a previous lawsuit.  The complaint alleges that the city violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it violated the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The SEC alleges that, in its judgment, the court found that there was no reasonable basis for the city to approve the project.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On June 8, the Palm Beach County Circuit Court issued a temporary restraining order halting the construction of the religious center, which was scheduled to be completed by the end of the year.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.   The judgment also prohibits the city from issuing any emergency relief in the event of an emergency, and from issuing an order to halt the project pending final approval by the court.  For more information on emergency relief, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (1937) and Litigation Alert No. 24-2022 (1941).  The court also issued an order suspending the pending application for a preliminary injunction against future violations, ordering a hearing on the matter, and appointing a receiver to determine whether to proceed with the litigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt of the Miami Regional Office and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC's litigation will be led by David A. Schiff. \u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Inspector General, the Florida Department of State Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Florida Attorney General's Office."
