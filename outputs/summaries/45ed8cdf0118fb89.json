  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against the City of Chicago and the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) in a pension case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, the city and FOP engaged in a long-running legal dispute over the use of the Side Letter calculation method. The complaint alleges that the City, FOP, and the FOP violated the federal securities laws by failing to adequately account for the increases in the retirees' pensions when calculating their pension obligations.  The complaint further alleges that, in 2002, the City and the Police Pension Board entered into an agreement that required the City to pay a \"pension spike\" of $800 per year to a retired officer who was eligible for the pension benefit. The settlement, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins the city from violating the pension code and orders it to pay an annualized pension increase of $876,000.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed an emergency action to halt the litigation. The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by John Rymas. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
