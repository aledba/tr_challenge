  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo & Co. that permanently enjoins the bank from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Wells Fargo to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Wells Fargo opened millions of unauthorized accounts and services without their knowledge or consent, including at least 2.1 million potentially unauthorized accounts, including 623,000 consumer and small business unsecured credit card accounts.  According to the complaint, Wells Fargo failed to adequately disclose to its customers that it had opened over a million unauthorized accounts in violation of the federal securities laws.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the bank failed to inform its customers of the potential conflicts of interest arising out of this conduct.  Wells Fargo also failed to disclose to their customers that the company had entered into an arbitration agreement with Wells Fargo that included a clause that would require the parties to submit to arbitration a judgment that would determine whether or not the arbitration agreement is enforceable.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the bank has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the securities laws, ordering it to pay civil penalties of $500,000, and imposing an officer-and-director bar.  On October 31, 2018, the court entered a judgment ordering the bank to comply with the court's order, ordering the company to pay $1 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and requiring Wells Fargo's payment of a civil monetary penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott Frost, Jennifer Zeleny, and John Rymas of the Salt Lake Regional Office, with the assistance of trial counsel Robert Baker of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Frost and Ms. Zeleny."
