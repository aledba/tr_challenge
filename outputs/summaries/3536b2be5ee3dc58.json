  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Stamford, Connecticut man who allegedly failed to disclose on his financial affidavit that he owned a condominium property and real property located in the Middle East.  According to the court's order, filed on June 14, 2011, the defendant failed to tell the court that he had opened the account in the name of his son and that the property was his.  The court also found that the defendant had failed to adequately disclose to his son that he was entitled to an award of postjudgment interest based on the value of the property.  In addition, the court found that, because the defendant knew about the undisclosed assets, he had a duty to disclose them to her at the time of the dissolution judgment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On August 9, 2018, a federal district court in New York granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for October 11, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 595-A.2d 1377.   The SEC's complaint charges the defendant with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgment of illusory gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendant. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Bromberg.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Office of Financial Regulation in this matter."
