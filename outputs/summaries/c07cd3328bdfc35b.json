  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (\"Chipotle\"), ordering the company to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Chipotle violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from at least July 2009 through December 2010, Chipotle required employees to purchase slip-resistant shoes from a vendor, Shoes for Crews, in order to work at Chipotle restaurants.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, the company did not require employees to buy shoes from the shoes, and instead deducted the cost of those shoes from their paychecks.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2010 and 2011, when Chipotle began requiring employees to pay for shoes, it did so without obtaining written authorization from the employee.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay civil penalties of $150,000, and bars them from serving as officers or directors of any public company.  On May 24, 2013, the court issued an order permanently enjoining Chipotle from violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 201(1), 204(2), and 226(3) of its books and records, and ordering it to pay disgorgement of $50,000 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $10,000 civil penalty for each of those violations.  Finally, on June 19, 2013 the court granted a motion for summary judgment against Kelly L. Gibson, Jr. (\"Kelly\") of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") in connection with a related criminal case.  Gibson agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations. Gibson agreed with the court's order that he will not violate the bar and will not participate in any class action brought by the SEC.  He also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney under the supervision of a public accountant.  To settle the matter, Gibson will be sentenced to a five-year officer and director bar and ordered to pay $1.5 million in restitution.  Kelly will be supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
