  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a foreclosure action.  According to the SEC's complaint, the defendants executed a promissory note on August 2, 2005 in which they promised to pay First Franklin division of National City Bank of Indiana the principal sum of $488,000.  The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to show how this conduct had a reasonable nexus to the making, validity, or enforcement of the note or mortgage.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that, contrary to the defendants' representations to the court, they failed to adequately allege that there was a binding modification to their note and mortgage, that the borrower defaulted on the loan, and that, despite due demand, the mortgagee failed to pay the balances due and owing.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Piper has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains with respect to the relief sought by the court in the complaint.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Connecticut Department of Banking and Securities, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in this matter."
