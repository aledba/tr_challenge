  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan yesterday entered a final judgment against a Michigan-based insurance company for denying coverage to an injured motorcyclist.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 2, 2014, James Toder was injured in an automobile accident while riding his motorcycle and received his policy limit of $20,000 in uninsured/underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage under his insurance policy.  The complaint alleges that Toder, who was insured under the policy, was not operating a motor vehicle at the time of the accident.  As alleged in the complaint, Toder's motorcycle was not covered under the UIM policy because it did not have four wheels.  Toder also had a Ford van, which he covered with a Progressive auto policy, and was unable to access UIM coverage because of the insurance company's actions.  In its judgment, the court found that the insurer violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws, orders it to pay a civil penalty of $50,000, and imposes a $25,000 civil penalty against Toder.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Insurance, and the Michigan Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
