  "summary": "On February 22, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia entered a final judgment in favor of Verizon Services Corp. (\"Verizon\") and its employees in an ongoing labor dispute.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kanawha County, West Virginia, alleges that, in 2016, Verizon Services, Inc. (\"VZ\"), through which it provides sales and services to customers of Verizon Communications, Inc., engaged in a nationwide strike of its union employees, failed to prove that there had been a substantial curtailment of work at its Clarksburg facility during the strike.  According to the complaint, the company's employees performed no work and did not receive any wages during the stoppage.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the company had overstocked its stores in anticipation of the strike and used other wholesalers and suppliers to ship goods directly to its retail locations.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Verizon has consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, LLC (\"Advisers\"), and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.   The court's order, which is subject to court approval, reserves the issue of whether to proceed with a judgment imposing a permanent injunction, imposing a conduct-based injunction, and ordering the company to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by David A. Adkins and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, and the Department of Justice in this matter."
