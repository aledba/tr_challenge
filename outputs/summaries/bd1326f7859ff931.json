  "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a New York-based trading firm and its co-defendant in a parallel action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that Lek Securities Corporation and its CEO, Terrence Hendershott, engaged in a multi-level scheme to manipulate the securities market.  According to the complaint, the scheme involved placing orders on both sides of the market to determine whether there was sufficient liquidity to execute trades.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the traders placed orders on either side of the open market, which is consistent with a market-moving strategy.  As alleged, however, the traders did not execute all of the orders.  Instead, the SEC alleges that they simply placed orders at the end of a trading day and then closed out their positions for a profit.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaints, Lek has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Lek from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Lek also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1789 (DLC), July 12, 2017 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 28, 2017).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant a number of other defendants who have agreed to permanent injunctions, to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, and to be deemed competent to provide an independent opinion on the merits of the case. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau of the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority (ORSA) in this matter."
