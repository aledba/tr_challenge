  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for Arizona announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against Jason Wayne Lay for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the Arizona district court for Precinct One of Yuma County, Lay was charged with harassment and threatening or intimidating after he developed an online relationship with someone he thought was a 14-year-old Phoenix girl.  The complaint alleges that Lay told the victim that he would kill her current partner and threatened to circulate nude photos of her and to go to her work or home and destroy her belongings.  As alleged in the complaint, Lay's conduct was designed to cause fear, anxiety and other emotional upset in the victims.  In a parallel action, the Arizona Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Lay arising from the same conduct.  Lay has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, plus prejudgment interest of $2,065, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions, and ordering him to return to his home, where he had been living, to comply with the court's order, and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be prohibited from participating in any conduct that constitutes a \"permanent and significant effect\" on the company's business.  On May 9, 2019, the court granted Lay's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to surrender his passport.  A hearing on June 13, 2019 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Arizona Department of Justice v. Lay, 2017."
