  "summary": "On March 5, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment against BMO Harris Bank N.A. (\"BMO\"), a Minnesota-based bank, for its role in the Petters' Ponzi scheme.  The court found that BMO violated Rule 37(e)(1) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Minnesota, BMO failed to preserve or preserve the emails or documents that contained relevant information related to Petters and Petters Company, Inc. (\"PCI\").  The complaint alleges that, contrary to representations to the court and the court, the company intentionally destroyed and failed to remove the emails from its records.  BMO also failed to inform its own counsel about the destruction of the backup tapes.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota today announced criminal charges against the company.  On March 6, 2020, the court entered an order requiring BMO to preserve, search, and index all of the emails in its possession, including those found in 2014 and 2017.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins BMO from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder, and orders the company to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael Collyard, Richard Spehr, and Jan Folena of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Douglas A. Kelley and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Minnesota Office of Professional Regulation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Minnesota Department of Banking and Securities."
