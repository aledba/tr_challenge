  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against GEICO General Insurance Company, Inc., a California-based reinsurance company, for negligently overcharging its insurance policyholder in a serious automobile accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Riverside County, California, alleges that GEICO unreasonably delayed paying its policyholder Mazik the policy limits of $50,000 on an underinsured motorist policy after Mazik was injured in the accident. According to the complaint, the company failed to adequately evaluate Mazik\u2019s injuries and instead selectively relied on medical records that supported its position that Mazik had fully recovered from the injury. The complaint further alleges that, in evaluating Mazik, GEICO failed to disclose to the claims adjuster that he had suffered a serious and permanent injury and that he was likely to require surgery. The SEC alleges that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(A) and 5(b)(5)(B) and (c) thereunder of the federal securities laws.

Welshhans entered a judgment ordering GEICO to pay a civil penalty of $4 million, ordering the company to disgorge $3 million in ill-gotten gains plus interest and a $100,000 civil penalty, and ordering the insurer to pay an $8 million civil penalty. The court also ordered the company and the insurance adjuster to jointly and severally pay $2.2 million in prejudgment interests.  According to a complaint filed in the U. S. District court in San Diego, Mazik's injuries were so severe that he needed surgery. In addition, the complaint alleges that in reviewing proposed settlement offers, Grothen had access to the entire claims file and spot checks the information. The jury deliberated for over an hour before finding that Grothen was liable for a civil monetary penalty that would be more than twice as high as the punitive damages awarded by GEICO. The final judgment, which was entered by the court, permanently enjoined Grothen from future violations of the securities laws and ordered him to"
