  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment against Mandi Mumm, a former federal prison inmate, for her role in a 2014 medical malpractice action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Council Bluffs, Iowa, alleges that Mumm was unlawfully incarcerated in a halfway house operated by CH, Inc. under a contract with the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Mumm alleged that the halfway house failed to get her needed medical attention and that the physician rendered negligent care, thereby leading to delayed detection and treatment of the stroke. The complaint further alleges that the jury was confused and wanted to award her 25% of her damages against Dr. Mileris. The jury deliberated for approximately twenty-four hours before Mumm agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Mumm to provide a jury trial transcript. The court agreed to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court of appeals.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mumm. The SEC is continuing its investigation into Mumm\u2019s alleged misconduct. The case is being handled by Scott A. Welshhans, John Rymas, and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Burt of the SEC."
