  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former employee of the North Slope Borough Department of Public Works for making threatening and aggressive statements in the workplace.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Anchorage, New York, alleges that Tom Donovan Nicolos, a licensed professional counselor, was terminated by the Borough on January 14, 2015, on the basis of his alleged misconduct.  According to the complaint, Nicolos told a supervisor that he was not in a good place, did not want to hurt others, had a premeditated plan to use firearms to harm or kill people at his workplace, and that he had a list of people he wanted to harm with guns or other weapons.  Nicolos also allegedly told his supervisor that Toalston was number one on his list of potential victims and that the Borough failed to conduct an adequate investigation before deciding to discharge him.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Nicolos.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Borough agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining Nicolos from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Nicolos to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunctive relief order.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Mascianica of the New York Regional Office, and is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
