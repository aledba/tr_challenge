  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Indiana today entered a final judgment in favor of the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that the SEC improperly relied on the opinions of state agency medical consultants in rejecting her application for disability insurance.  According to the complaint, Dr. Reecer, who is board certified in physical medicine and rehabilitation and a certified physician assistant at Fort Wayne Orthopedics, failed to adequately evaluate the medical evidence presented to the court.  For example, the complaint alleges that, in evaluating her claims, the SEC failed to consider the fact that she had a history of severe physical and mental impairments and that she was unable to perform any work related to her disability.  In addition, the court failed to properly consider the evidence presented by other medical professionals, including a vocational expert who reviewed Plaintiff's claims.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Indiana Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
