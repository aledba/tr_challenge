  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil action brought by a company that defrauded investors out of millions of dollars.  The SEC's complaint alleges that J.R. Simplot and his company, Dickinson Frozen Foods, LLC (DFF), violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Simplot, DFF, and DFF violated the anti-fraud provision of Section 12-120 of the Exchange Act.  According to the complaint, Simplot's complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., alleged that DFF and Simplot violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 12(b)(6) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint also alleges that Dff violated the broker-dealer registration provision of Sections 13(a)(1) and 13(c) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-13, and 13b2-14 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order Simplot to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Simplot.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in the District Court against DFF.   The court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against further violations of the securities laws and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000.  Simplot agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of Section 13(b).  The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Idaho Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Idaho Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
