  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of West Virginia today entered a final judgment against Massey Energy Co. and its former directors and officers in a shareholder derivative action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in West Virginia, alleges that Massey and its then-Board of Directors violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to disclose that the merger resulted in substantial value to Massey shareholders when negotiating and approving the merger.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants did not disclose material information about the merger when negotiating the merger with Alpha Natural Resources, Inc., a subsidiary of Massey.  As a result of the defendants' misconduct, Massey's stock price increased significantly, and the petitioners lost standing to pursue the derivative claims.  Massey agreed to settle the SEC's action by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the Defendants consented to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the federal and state securities laws, ordering the defendants to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, pay civil penalties, and pay officer-and-director bar in the amounts of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively, and ordering the Defendants to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  On June 7, 2018, the court granted the Defendants' motion for leave to amend the Complaint and granted the defendants a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15(b)(5) and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and granted them the right to apply for a preliminary injunction against future violations.  Additionally, on May 16, 2011, the Court of Chancery issued an order suspending the Defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any securities in the United States that may be subject to court approval.  This order also prohibits Defendants from acting as unregistered broker-dealers in connection with the issuance or sale of a security, including securities in a public company, and from engaging in self-flagellation and prejudgmentation of the securities laws.
