  "summary": "On February 4, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Indiana entered a final judgment against the Commissioner of Social Security Administration denying Plaintiff's application for Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that the Commissioner improperly relied on the testimony of a long-time care physician to determine whether Plaintiff could perform a significant number of jobs in the national economy.  According to the complaint, the Commissioner failed to consider the fact that Plaintiff had been suffering from severe back pain, arthritis, and diabetic neuropathy for many years.  The complaint further alleges that, contrary to the Commissioner's findings, Plaintiff was unable to perform any of the jobs required for her to be entitled to Social Security disability insurance because of her diabetes.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Plaintiff's diabetes caused her to experience severe pain, stiffness, and fatigue, and that she had difficulty standing or walking.  As a result of the Commission's decision, Plaintiff has been unable to participate in any meaningful work within the economy since 2014.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Commission has issued a Final Judgment that permanently enjoins Plaintiff from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Pollock and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in this matter."
