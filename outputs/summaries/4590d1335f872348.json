  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was unable to attend a hearing because of an unavailability of a witness.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that the Oregon Attorney General's Office improperly obtained a subpoena on a witness who had been unable to show up to testify at trial.  According to the complaint, the court found that the defendant had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant had repeatedly threatened to kill the witness and had repeatedly told her that he was the acting president of the Mongols, telling her that, if she went to the police, he could dig a hole and bury her in the ground and no one would ever find her.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The final judgment also orders the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $100,000 civil penalty.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Robert C. Hannan of the federal district court for the Eastern District of Oregon granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder, and orders Hannan to comply with the court\u2019s order barring him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  Hannan also agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from associating with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, investment adviser, or registered investment adviser. The court also granted the SEC the right to request a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Oregon State Corporation Commission in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone offering to sell or offer them an investment in an investment by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0report to\u00c2\u00a0the SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify investors who are at risk of losing their investment"
