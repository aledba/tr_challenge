  "summary": "The Ohio Department of Education today announced that it has obtained a temporary restraining order halting an ongoing litigation action by Ohio-based real estate developer Network Restorations I, L.L.C.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that Columbus City Schools Bd. of Edn., 151 Ohio St. 3d 12, 2017-Ohio-2734, 85 N.E.3d 694), and Notestine Manor, Inc. (\u201cNotestine Manor\u201d) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the appraiser.  According to the SEC's order, the auditor valued the property at $4,417,500 for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2013.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the BTA has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains the valuation of the property and orders it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its value. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 17, 2017, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office issued an order appointing a receiver to determine the true value of a low-income-housing property. The receiver will determine the value based on the valuation determination of the receiver upon the recommendation of the court."
