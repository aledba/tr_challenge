  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Wilhelmsen Maritime Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the company, and two other companies charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on June 19, 2018, the SEC alleges that, from at least 2014 through at least 2018, defendants engaged in a multi-pronged pricing strategy to determine the market for certain products and services, including boiler water, cooling water, and air conditioning products.  The complaint alleges that defendants used market segmentation for the purpose of determining whether a specific product or service could be a \"reasonable substitute\" for another product.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants' pricing strategy is inconsistent with the market-based nature of the products they sell.  For example, the complaint alleges, among other things, that defendants failed to account for the fact that, in many instances, the prices of boiler water and cooling water products were so high that they could not be accurately calculated.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties.  On June 20, 2019, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Gottschall of the U.N. Division of Economic and Risk Analysis issued a temporary restraining order halting the proposed merger, ordering a preliminary injunction, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against further violations of the anti-fraud provision of Section 13(b).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Jennifer Chun Barry and Ms. Basinger. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
