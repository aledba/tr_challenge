  "summary": "On May 18, 2006, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against defendant Kristian Von Ritzhoff, finding him permanently and permanently disabled.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on May 18 and unsealed on May 24, 2009, the court found that, on three separate occasions, defendant was unable to cross-examine his client because he had been denied due process.  The complaint further alleged that, during one of these instances, defendant had the opportunity to testify before the court, but instead refused to do so because he did not have the right to.  As alleged in the complaint, in the third hearing of the case, the judge granted the court's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered that VonRitzhoff comply with the court order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against defendant.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from appearing before the SEC as an attorney or practicing as a public figure.  On May 20, 2013, the SEC issued an order requiring the court to consider the merits of the claims in its order against the defendant in a parallel administrative proceeding.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Office of Inspector General, and the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
