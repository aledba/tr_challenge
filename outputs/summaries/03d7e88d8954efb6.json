  "summary": "On January 23, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the Arkansas Times, which alleges that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that the First Amendment applies to all forms of free speech, including the right to engage in political boycotts of Israel.  According to the complaint, the SEC alleges that, in violation of the federal law, the Times violated the First and Second Amendment by failing to register as a \"boycott\" with the federal government.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In addition, the court granted the Times' request for a temporary restraining order and a cease-and-desist order, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  On January 24, 2020, the United States District Court entered a preliminary injunction against the defendants, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, a civil monetary penalty, and a penny stock bar against each of the defendants.  To determine whether to proceed with the litigation, the Court also ordered the companies to provide a copy of the complaint to the SEC, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1771 (1962).  In a parallel action, the Department of Justice today announced that it has obtained a court order halting the defendants' violations of the anti-bias provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, promotion, or promotion of any type of political or religious statement, without a legitimate basis.  This order also prohibits the Defendants from engaging in any conduct that constitutes a \"pre-judgment interest\" in the federal district court for the Northern District of Arkansas, including a boycott of Israel, and from participating or participating in any commercial purchase of a product or service that is not subject to First Amendment protection.  It also orders the companies not to participate in the boycott, and to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively, for violations of Section"
