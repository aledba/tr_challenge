  "summary": "On June 7, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a convicted felon for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, John MacKenzie shot and killed a New York State Police Officer during a burglary in 1975.  The complaint alleges that the Board of Parole determined that the defendant had a history of committing felonies, had no disciplinary infractions since 1980, assumed leadership positions in various prison programs, worked for years to found a Victims' Awareness Program in prison, and was assessed \"low\" for all risk factors on his prior conviction.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the Board's determination was based exclusively on the severity of the defendant's underlying criminal conviction and did not require reversal.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  To learn more about civil contempt, see Litigation Release Bulletin No. 598 (January 2, 2016).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert on the subject of civil contempt.
