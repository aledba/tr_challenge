  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jedo J. Jerke, a South Sudanese political refugee who was convicted and sentenced to a term of 4 to 6 years\u2019 imprisonment.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on August 6, 2012, Jerke told his appointed counsel that he wished to accept the Nebraska Postconviction Act and enter a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to an ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The complaint alleges that Jerke was not aware of possible immigration consequences resulting from his conviction, and that his trial counsel had failed to advise him before he entered his plea that second degree assault was a deportable offense.  The complaint further alleges that the court improperly granted Jerke's motion to vacate his conviction and withdraw his plea, which was subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Jerke from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Jerke to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his sentence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Nebraska today announced criminal charges against Jerke. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Ciampi. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Nebraska Office of Immigration and Citizenship, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Nebraska Department of Justice in this matter."
