  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the California Department of Water Resources' motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, California, alleges that, in 1969, the California Secretary of State's Office issued an order requiring the District of Columbia Water Resources Control Board to determine whether a prior owner of a dry cleaning facility could be held liable for the discharge of waste into the waters of the state.  According to the complaint, the order required that prior owners of the dry cleaners be named in a cleanup order.  In addition, the complaint alleges that prior owner liability for discharge could be determined by the district court by whether the prior owner knew or should have known of the risk of discharge.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13304 of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  On October 25, 2018, the court granted the SEC\u2019s motion for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary asset freeze, and ordered the District Court to issue an order appointing a receiver to determine the appropriate amount of relief to be provided to the relief investor.  To learn more about this matter, see Litigation Release No. 13304 (January 24, 2019).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against UATC, Resolution Trust Corp., Inc., and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (Nov. 21, 2018).  The litigation will be led by John Rymas of the San Diego Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the District Attorney's Office of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
