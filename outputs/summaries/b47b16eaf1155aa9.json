The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Palmdale, California, alleges that, on December 3, 1978, Terry Moses entered a guilty plea and was sentenced to five life terms without the possibility of parole.  According to the complaint, Moses initially refused to cooperate with the defendants, but later changed his mind after the court found him guilty of the charges.  In a parallel action, the U. S.

Finally, the court agreed to send a copy of the judgment to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which will determine the amount of restitution to be paid to the victims of the alleged crime.  It also ordered Moses to comply with the court\u2019s order that he surrender his right to a jury trial, which would determine whether to impose a penalty of 10 years or less, and that he would pay a restitution fine of $6,500.
