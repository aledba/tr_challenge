  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Ohio today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of corrupting another with drugs.  According to the SEC's complaint, on August 4, 2016, a Cuyahoga County jury found that Mark R. Price was liable for the death of an Ohio man who died from a drug overdose.  The complaint alleges that Price provided the victim with heroin and fentanyl in the course of a drug transaction.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the victim did not have a prescription for the drug.  Instead, the complaint alleges, Price supplied the heroin to a third party and provided the drug to the victim.  In a second assignment of error, the court found that Price violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Price consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $3,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Price also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any drug, other than for his own personal use, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest.  On August 5, Price pleaded guilty to one count of felony drug possession and was sentenced to eight years of supervised release.  He was also ordered to pay $2,500 in restitution, a $1,000 civil penalty, and a $100,000 officer- and director-and director bar.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Ricchiute and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
