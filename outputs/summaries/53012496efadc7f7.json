  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against Henrico County, Va., that permanently enjoins HHHunt from building a road in Hanover County.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Richmond, Virginia, in 1989, the County Board of Supervisors rezoned 1,089 acres for a large master-planned community named Wyndham. The complaint alleges that, prior to the Board\u2019s decision to abandon the road, the county did not have a legitimate right to develop the road. In addition, the complaint alleges, in 1992, when the Board was required to find that the road was no longer necessary for public use, it did not include a right of way. In 2016, the court found that the County had no vested right in the continuation of Dominion Club Drive, and that it could not rely on the abandonment provisions of Title 33.2 of the state road system. The court also ruled that, in the future, a city could rely on a constitutionally vested right to build a road when it had no such right at any time.  The court further ruled that the county had no reasonable right to proceed with the development of a road.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Virginia today announced criminal charges against the County. The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that the Court improperly held that the District of Columbia violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining the County from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties. The Commission has also agreed to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty. The Court also ordered the County to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the Commission.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Murnahan and Carol A. Hannan and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Mr. Hannahan and Ms. Braunstein. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson."
