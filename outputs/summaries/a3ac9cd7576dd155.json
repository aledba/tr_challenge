  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the California Native Plant Society, Inc. (\"Association\") against the City of Victorville for failing to recirculate an Environmental Quality Act (EIR) that required the city to generate electricity on-site.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Rancho Cordova, California, Wal-Mart and its subsidiary, Rothbart Development Corporation (RDC), failed to adequately analyze the project's impacts on greenhouse gas emissions and its consistency with the general plan.  The complaint further alleges that the City failed to consider the potential impacts of the project on the city's land use and development plans.  In addition, the complaint alleges the City did not adequately prepare an adequate EIR before approving the project.  As alleged in the complaint, the city failed to make all of the findings required by the EIR, including the fact that the project would cause the level of service at certain of the affected intersections to become deficient.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's judgment, the City consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, LLC (\"Advisers\"), and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  Wal-mart agreed to a permanent injunction and to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be imposed by the court upon the City.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.
