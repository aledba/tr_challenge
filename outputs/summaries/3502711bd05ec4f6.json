  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against convicted child pornography violator Patrick Harris, finding him liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in November 2014, Harris pleaded guilty to one count of possession of child pornography and was sentenced to eighty months of imprisonment.  According to the complaint, Harris admitted to downloading child pornography from peer-to-peer file sharing programs, such as eMule and Bit Torrent, to search, obtain, and share child pornography.  He also admitted that he had been viewing child pornography for a lengthy period of time.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court improperly applied a two-level enhancement for the purpose of knowing distribution, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's presentence report, to a total of more than 1,000 images of prepubescent and pubescent minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.  As alleged, Harris also admitted to using the internet to obtain and share known child pornography, including images of sadistic or masochistic activities, and to the use of a computer.  Harris also agreed to the entry of a judgment that imposes a five-level sentencing enhancement, which requires the court to consider whether a different sentence was required.   The court also found that Harris did not object at his sentencing hearing to the fact that it had \"view[ed] statements [he had] made in the light most favorable to [him] that were out of proportion with the offense conduct.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Harris arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.
