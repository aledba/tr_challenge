  "summary": "On October 18, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Ohio entered a final judgment against a former employee of Meigs County EMS/Meigs County Commissioners who allegedly caused a car to crash into an ambulance.  According to the court's order, on March 23, 2013, while responding to an emergency call from an urgent care facility, Lyons veered left of center and hit a sedan traveling in the opposite direction.  The court found that, at the time of the collision, Lyons was exceeding the posted speed limit by at least twenty miles per hour.  As alleged in the complaint, Lyons's actions were reckless and did not constitute willful or wanton misconduct.  Folmer's complaint, filed in federal district court in Ohio, charges Lyons with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Lyons consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, prejudgment interest of $2,038.81, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against Lyons.  On October 19, 2016, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered a judgment against Lyons, finding him liable for liability under the federal criminal laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, and to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $75,000, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio State Attorney General's Office, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
