The court entered a temporary restraining order against Polaha and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  According to the SEC's complaint, Polaha made an RTKL request on October 14, 2014, to the Pennsylvania Department of Housing and Urban Development, which administers the Housing Choice Voucher Program, which provides rental assistance to low-income families.

Additionally, the order requires the Authority to provide an accounting of the number of HCVP tenants who are receiving assistance from the Township, and the date on which the property was last inspected.
