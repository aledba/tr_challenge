  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern and Southern Districts of Iowa today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a related criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Des Moines, Iowa, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including the securities laws.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to show a realistic probability that they would be convicted of aiding and abetting the delivery of a controlled substance under federal law.  For example, the complaint alleges that they were convicted of possession with intent to manufacture, deliver, or deliver, a drug and were subject to the mandatory minimum fifteen-year sentence imposed by the federal district courts.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Iowa announced criminal charges against the defendants.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, these defendants were convicted under the federal laws by way of a prior felony conviction, and were sentenced to prison terms ranging from five to ten years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions, and ordered them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their prison time.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Iowa Department of Criminal Justice, and the Iowa State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter.\u00c2\u00a0In its continuing investigation, the SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check whether they are registered professionals by using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether a person has a history of drug-related felony convictions.  This information is available on Investor.gov and the SEC\u00c2\u00a0Sector.gov websites."
