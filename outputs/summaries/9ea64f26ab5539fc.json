  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former dean of a public university for defrauding students out of millions of dollars.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio on November 16, 2017, alleges that former dean Julian Endres violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Endres agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint by agreeing to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and requires him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Endres also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a university for five years.  In a parallel action, on November 19, 2015, a federal district court in Charlotte, North Carolina, found that Endres was entitled to qualified immunity on the basis of his alleged misconduct.  On November 21, 2016, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, ordered Endres to return to NEOMED, and ordered the college to provide him with a copy of the final judgment, which is subject to court approval.  Last week, the SEC issued an order suspending Endres from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of an ongoing investigation that was conducted by the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations, with the assistance of the Division of Education Office of the Department of Justice.    The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio, and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
