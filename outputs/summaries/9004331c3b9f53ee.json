  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New Jersey today announced criminal charges against a Franklin, New Jersey man for his role in two alleged violations of the Open Public Records Act (OPRA).  The SEC's complaint alleges that on March 19, 2014, Jeff Carter served two requests on the Franklin Fire District No. 1 (District) seeking documents related to its purported violation of the OPRA.  According to the complaint, Carter requested that the District produce responsive e-mails in their original electronic format, in which any of the identified individuals were \"cc[d] or \u201cbcc[rd]\u201d when requested.  The complaint also alleges that Carter failed to provide a detailed explanation of his search, as required by Rule 1:6-6, for the District's search for responsive documents.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that Szymborski failed to inform the District of the need for a special service charge when the District had already produced responsive documents in that format.  Carter also allegedly failed to disclose to the GRC that he was not entitled to the requested documents because he did not have personal knowledge of the searches conducted by the District or the IT vendor and the District employees and, therefore, could not competently certify that the search was reasonable and warranted.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Carter consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a $20,000 civil penalty.  On May 24, 2015, the District issued an order requiring the District to comply with the court's order, ordering it to produce responsive materials in the \"original electronic format\" and requiring it to provide an IT vendor with a copy of the responsive documents requested by Carter.   The order also requires the district to provide access to the records in the form of a \"completed and signed statement of information\" (SOI) and a \"short certification.\"  The court also ordered that the district comply with its July 13, 2014 order by providing access to all e-mail records requested by the district.  It also ordered the district's IT consultant to search the District e-mails located on the District&rsquo;s server for responsive materials.  Finally, the order required the district produce responsive records in a format consistent with the requirements of the federal securities laws, and requires the records custodian to provide timely and accurate information about the search.
