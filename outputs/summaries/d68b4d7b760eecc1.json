  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a temporary restraining order against a Texas-based Border Patrol agent accused of unlawfully using excessive force in connection with an alleged terrorist attack.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in El Paso, Texas, alleges that, on June 7, 2010, Sergio Hernandez, a 15-year-old Mexican citizen without family in the United States, took a position on the Mexican side of a culvert where a group of young men began throwing rocks at him. The complaint alleges that Agent Mesa fired several shots across the border, causing the agent to be fatally injured.  According to the complaint, the defendants' claims were dismissed on the basis of \"special factors\" that the court deemed relevant to the issues of national security and foreign law enforcement.\u201d  The complaint further alleges that the defendants were not entitled to a Bivens remedy when, in fact, they were entitled to one based on the facts of the case.

Separately, a federal district court in Arizona has also ruled against extending the suspension to a third defendant.  On September 24, 2017, the Honorable Judge William J. Wilkie of the United Kingdom entered an order permanently enjoining the suspension from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) the books and records of the federal government.  Wilkie has agreed to a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 5 of the books, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar from serving as an officer or director of a public agency. The order also prohibits Wilkie from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service, including the right to a penny stock. The court's order also requires Wilkie to"
