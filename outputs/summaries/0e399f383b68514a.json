  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Massey's motion for a temporary restraining order against him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Massey violated Section 712A.19b(3)(a)(ii) and Rule 712B.9(a) thereunder by failing to provide sufficient evidence to justify his termination of parental rights.

For example, the order requires that a court determine whether an individual has a reasonable basis for terminating parental rights when it finds reasonable reason to terminate a person's parental rights at a time when the individual is not a member of any Indian tribe.  It also requires that an individual be required to provide proof of a bona fide relationship with the person at issue, including that the individual has an attorney and that he/she has a legal source of income, and that a reasonable likelihood that the child will be placed in a foster home over the parent's home is a reasonable probability that the parent will be able to provide for the child's needs.  Additionally, the Court requires the individual to provide a \"reasonable basis for termination\" when he or she has not provided any evidence to support the individual's claim of having any Native American heritage.
