  "summary": "On March 21, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Kevin Barker, a convicted felon who was sentenced to four years imprisonment, four years of hard labor, and three years of active probation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that on or about October 4, 2018, Kevin Barker went to the Boomtown Casino located on Peters Road in Jefferson Parish after receiving information from a known confidential informant that defendant would deliver a quantity of methamphetamine and liquid methamphetamine to the casino. According to the complaint, the tip provided by the CI indicated that defendant was going to carry the methamphetamine in a backpack. The complaint further alleges that the CI's tip accurately predicted defendant's future conduct in sufficient detail to support a reasonable belief that he and the black male were distributing the methamphetamine from that location.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, that the tip was not accurate and that the evidence seized from Mr. Jones' backpack was not consistent with the evidence presented to the court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Barker.  On March 20, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Barker, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-402 (Feb. 19, 2020).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Amy C. McKinley of the New Orleans Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, and the New Jersey Department of Criminal Justice."
