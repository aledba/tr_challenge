  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Lester W. Pauley, who was convicted of three counts of aggravated sexual battery in 2008.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, from at least February 2008 through August 2014, Pauley engaged in oral sex with multiple women, including one woman who was also a victim of the alleged crimes.  According to the complaint, the victims told Pauley that they were going to have sex and that he demanded oral sex, that he had a screwdriver, and that she had told him to \"grab it down\" and \"put it down.\"  The complaint further alleges that Pauley allegedly forced one of the women into the sleeper cabin of his truck and began to rape her.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Pauley.  Pauley has agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  On May 29, 2015, a jury found Pauley guilty of four of the charges, including kidnapping, aggravated battery, false imprisonment, and terroristic threats, and Pauley was ordered to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  A jury found him liable for the remaining four charges, ordering him to pay $2,500 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and ordering Pauley to pay civil penalties of $3,500 and $500,000, respectively, for each of the other charges.  Without admitting to these charges, the complaint also alleges that Pauley violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  To settle the case, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Pauley from violating the above-mentioned provisions, imposes a civil injunctive relief, and orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with interest, pay a $500 civil penalty, and appoint a receiver of the victims' funds.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-3-1 (1).  The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Georgia State Attorney General's Office, the Alabama Department of Banking and Securities, the U."
