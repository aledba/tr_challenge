  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against two men who were convicted of reckless endangerment during flight from law enforcement.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Cleveland, Ohio, Milton Sherrod and Brandon Heard, both convicted felons in possession of a gun, claimed that an unknown male shot at them from another vehicle, and that they were fleeing out of the car.  Sherrod allegedly replied by firing one round from his gun in the air, causing the vehicle to crash into a house.  As alleged in the complaint, Sherrod was not the driver of the vehicle, but rather a passenger in the vehicle.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against Sherrod.  On March 27, 2016, the court issued an order imposing a two-level, three-level and four-level sentencing enhancement on Sherrod, who was also convicted of violating the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, a $25,000 civil penalty, and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar.  To settle the SEC case, the defendant agreed to a permanent injunction, to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provision, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-05. \u00c2\u00a0On March 29, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, charging Sherrod with violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal criminal laws, and with aiding and abetting the defendants\u2019 violations of those provisions. The SEC is continuing its investigation, which is being conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper."
