  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death for his role in the murders of his aunt and uncle.  The court found that Quintin Phillippe Jones violated the antifraud provisions of Section 3599 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, Jones, who was previously convicted for capital murder, falsely claimed that he had an alter ego named James who lived in his head and who was responsible for killing Bryant. The court also found that Jones had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, had been convicted of several juvenile felony charges, and had been sentenced to prison for a prior felony conviction.  In a judgment that permanently enjoins Jones from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $30,000, Jones will be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and will be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Jones consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and appointing a post-conviction attorney.  Jones also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and to pay civil penalties of $7,500 and $8,500, respectively, for each of his prior felony convictions.  As a condition of granting the judgment, Jones agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations, and agreed to pay disgorgement of $3,500 plus prejudgment interests of $1,038, and to a $50,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David A. Schiff and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Schiff, Ms. Barry, and Ms. Schiff. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Attorney General's Office, and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice."
