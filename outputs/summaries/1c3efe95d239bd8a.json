  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maine today entered a final judgment against First American Title Insurance Company, Inc. (\"First American\"), a Maine-based title insurance company, and its closing agent, HLC Escrow, Inc., for failing to timely and timely respond to First American's claims.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Winterport, Maine, alleges that First American violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it failed to apply Maine's six-year limitations period to certain types of contracts and financial instruments. First American also failed to respond to the SEC's repeated denial of its insurance claim in 2010.  In a parallel action, on August 9, 2016, a federal district court in Portland, Maine entered a judgment that permanently enjoins First American from violating the securities laws and orders First American to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its mortgage lien.  First American agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  On August 23, 2017, the court granted First American a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of First American, and ordering it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil monetary penalty of $100,000. The court also granted the Trasks' request for an emergency asset freeze.  According to the complaint, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 751 (D. Me. Dec. 29, 2016).  The Commission on Civil and Administrative Litigation has issued an Order appointing a receiver for First American. The Commission is continuing its investigation into the matter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Maine Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Maine Office of Insurance Regulation in this matter."
