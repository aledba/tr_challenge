  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Wisconsin today announced criminal charges against a Wisconsin teenager accused of stealing a car and driving it into adult court.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in July 2015, then-16-year-old Matthew C. Hinkle approached a stopped car in Milwaukee County, reached into the driver's window, shut off the car, and ordered the driver out of the car.  According to the complaint, Hinkle then took the car and drove it to Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, where he claimed to have obtained an adult-court adult jurisdiction over Hinkle.  Hinkle's complaint, filed in federal district court in Milwaukee, charges Hinkle with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 938 of the federal criminal code, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Central District of New York today entered a temporary restraining order against Hinkle, freezing his assets, and ordering him to surrender his passport and other documents in order to obtain an exemption from the registration requirements of Sections 938.183(1) and (2).  The court's order also prohibits Hinkle from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit or other security deposit in the name of a court or agency, and prohibits him from associating with any person who has been charged with a felony in connection with the issuance of a security deposit.   The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas and Eric Werner of the Chicago Regional Office, with assistance from Scott Frost, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Wisconsin Department of Justice, the Federal Office of Inspector General, and the Wisconsin Attorney General's Office in this matter."
