  "summary": "On January 8, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska entered a final judgment against Mark Lawrence Bentley, Jr., a Nebraska man accused of defrauding his wife, Debra S. Waters, by failing to disclose to her husband that he was the father of a child.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Omaha, Nebraska, Mark and Debra Waters engaged in a long-running custody dispute in which they raised Maci Jane Waters, a 6-year-old daughter. The complaint alleges that Mark, who was in the Army at the time, was not fit to hold custody of Maci, despite having knowledge of the child's development and having been put on notice of the baby\u2019s birth in 2010. Mark also allegedly had a history of marijuana use and diagnoses of \"bonding attachment disorder\" and \"grand mal seizures.\" The complaint further alleges that after learning that Maci was pregnant, Mark took steps to remove the child from his mother and mother-in-law's home. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mark.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Denver Regional Office and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Nebraska Department of Health, and the Nebraska Office of Child and Family Education in this matter."
