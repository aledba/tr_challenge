  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment in favor of the Pennsylvania Department of Justice against Raymond Holloway, Jr., a convicted felon who was previously barred from the federal securities laws for driving under the influence.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Holloway violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rules 5b-5(b) and (c) thereunder.  The SEC alleges that Holloway was barred from possession of a firearm because he was a \"historically barred\" person who was likely to commit a serious crime.  As alleged in the complaint, however, that he was not a \"serious\" person and thus was not subject to the mandatory minimum jail term and a five-year maximum penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of five years\u2019 imprisonment and a $1,500 fine.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney General of Pennsylvania yesterday announced criminal charges against Holloway for his role in the alleged scheme.  Among other things, the SEC charged Holloway with violating Section 922(g)(1) and Rule 9a-3 thereunder, and the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Binderup of the U.N. Office of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers posed by repeat DUI offenders.  Investors can quickly and easily check whether a person has committed a serious felony by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0report tool to quickly identify whether they are a threat to themselves, others, and to detect signs of impairment.  For example, in a recent case, a jury found that a defendant with a prior felony conviction had a reasonable chance of recovering from a felony conviction, but the jury found him guilty of a felony and sentenced him to five years of imprisonment. \u00c2\u00a0In a related case,"
