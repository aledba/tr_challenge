Scott, Jr., a Philadelphia man who was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder and related offenses described infrequently in court filings.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on December 21, 2016, Appellant, a resident of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and his wife Juana Nunez, a member of the family owned Lorena's Grocery, were among the victims of a December 2011 robbery and attempted to convince a jury that the defendants were \"evil\" and \"bad.\"  The complaint alleges that, during cross-examination of the victims, the defendant allegedly told them that he had no involvement in the robberies and that he would \"say whatever\" if they asked him to.
