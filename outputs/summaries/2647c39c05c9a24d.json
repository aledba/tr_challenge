  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 29 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that defendant Brandon A. Riley, who was convicted on one count of robbery in violation of the federal securities laws, agreed to pay a $75 indigent recoupment fee.  According to the complaint, Riley agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations and agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions.  Riley also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Riley.  On May 2, 2018, the court granted Riley's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay $75,000 in disgorgement, $75 in prejudgment interest, and a $10,000 civil penalty.  After the court's order was granted, Riley consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 29(a)(2) and (3) of the Exchange Act and Rules of Practice, and orders him to comply with the court order and pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his original sentence.   The court also ordered Riley to pay an $80,000 penalty, not to exceed 50 percent of the original sentence imposed by the court, and to provide for a mandatory three-year post-release control period.  As alleged, Riley has agreed to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of this matter, which is continuing. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and how they are performing their work.  For example, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Department of Corrections, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Attorney General's Office in this matter."
