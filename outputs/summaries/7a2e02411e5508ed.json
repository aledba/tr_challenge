  "summary": "On March 27, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Texas entered a final judgment against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that Paxton violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the imposition of a $40 jury fee on convicted defendants violated the separation-of-powers provision of the federal securities laws.  Paxton agreed with the SEC that the jury fee is not a legitimate criminal justice purpose and that it is a tax gatherer.

(2)   The court ordered Paxton to pay court costs, which totaled $334, including $40 for a $250 \"DNA Record Fee\" collected by a district court in Harris County, the court in which the complaint was filed.   In its order, the Court of Criminal Appeals issued a temporary restraining order, which prohibits Paxton from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with a criminal case.  It also issued an order requiring the district court to determine whether to issue an order imposing a jury-freezing injunction against any person, entity, or method of conducting a criminal trial.  This order also requires the court to consider whether a defendant has met his or her burden of establishing that the statute is valid and that he or she has a duty to comply with the requirements of Section 102.004 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.  Additionally, the order requires that a jury be impaneled by a specific district court and that a judge and jury be appointed by the court at a certain time. \u00c2\u00a0 The court also ordered the district attorney to determine"
