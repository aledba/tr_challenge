  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against the Secretary of Health and Human Services for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b) of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Norfolk, Virginia, alleges that the Secretary violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the Secretary failed to enforce a provision in FAQ 33 that requires hospitals to account for private insurance payments in calculating their uncompensated care costs.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in determining \"reasonable costs\" incurred, hospitals must amortize the cost of refinancing bonds over the life of the old bonds.  As alleged, the FAQ 33 policy is inconsistent with the rule and, therefore, should not be promulgated through notice-and-comment rulemaking.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the secretary consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the relevant federal statutes and orders him to pay disgorgement of $19.1 million, prejudgment interest of $1.2 million, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia Department of Health, and the Virginia Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
