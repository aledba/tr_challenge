  "summary": "On March 7, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against Mission Solutions, LLC (\"MSE\"), a defense contractor that supplies systems engineering, software engineering, integration services and products for mission-critical defense systems, that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the company to pay $3.5 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, charges MSE with violating the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. MSE has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by agreeing to a permanent injunction against future violations of the reporting provision. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 6, 2017, the court granted a motion for summary judgment against MSE and ordered it to file an amended response to the complaint.  In a parallel action, on March 9, 2020, the United States District Court in Newark entered an order granting the company's request for a temporary restraining order and ordering it to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, MSE consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating these provisions. The court also granted MSE's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 102(b)(2) and Rule 15a-1 thereunder.  MSE agreed to pay a $3,5 million civil penalty, which is equal to the amount of the company and the amount it will pay to the court. The SEC also agreed to an order requiring MSE to provide a copy of its internal SEC complaint, which was filed in the same court as the amended complaint. The Court also granted the company the right to request a hearing to determine whether to proceed with a civil action.  A hearing for the SEC on March 8, 2020 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018."
