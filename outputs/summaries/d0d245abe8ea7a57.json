  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Philadelphia man who was convicted of attempted possession with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that on September 11, 2012, Philadelphia Police Officer Marcus Bowens and Special Agent Jared Krzwyicki of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Explosives (ATF) conducted a search warrant for the home of a drug dealer who was targeted for an armed home invasion.  According to the complaint, the search was conducted using historical cell-site location information (CSLI) provided by two co-defendants who had been previously convicted of the same felony and were later sentenced to prison terms ranging from three to five years.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Bowens, Anthony, and Scott were among those arrested in connection with the alleged scheme.  As set forth in the SEC's Complaint, the court found that Anthony lacked standing to challenge the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC complaint, Bowens consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and Section\u00c2\u00a010(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 5b2-1 and 5a-11 thereunder, and ordering him to surrender his passport.  Bowens also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Scott agreed to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and to a conduct-based injunction against future violations.  On September 13, 2018, a federal jury found Anthony guilty of one count of conspiracy to commit a felony and sentenced him to 10 years in prison.  Last week, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Anthony, charging him with violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder and against Anthony for aiding and abetting Anthony's violations of Section 5(b).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Anthony."
