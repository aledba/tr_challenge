  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin today entered a final judgment against Shawn T. Wiskerchen, a convicted felon who was sentenced to five years in prison for a series of home burglaries.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison, Wis., alleges that, on May 8, 2015, a federal district court in Chicago issued a temporary restraining order halting the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the court found that the defendant had committed prior burglaries of N.D.'s home, including one in May 2016, and that he had previously burglarized the victim's home.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Wiskechen.  On May 9, 2016, the Court of Appeals in Madison issued an order suspending the suspension of the suspension and ordering the restitution of $8,487.41, a total of $973.20, for losses incurred by the victim in the May 8 burglary. The court also issued a cease-and-desist order and ordered the restitution order to be entered at a later date.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's order, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $32,138.43, a penalty equal to the amount of restitution he has already paid to the victim, and a $13,791 civil penalty for the same amount of loss sustained by the previous burglary.  Wisker has also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wisconsin Department of Insurance, and the Wisconsin State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
