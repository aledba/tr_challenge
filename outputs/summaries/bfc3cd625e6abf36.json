  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jorge Sainz Navarrete, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to a total of 240 months in prison for his role in a money-laundering scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Omaha, Nebraska, alleges that, from at least November 2016 through at least July 2016,Navarrete recruited drivers to transport vehicles from Arizona to Nebraska that contained methamphetamine in hidden compartments, including in a cavity behind the wheel of a PT Cruiser. According to the complaint, the drivers went on at least six trips and, on each trip, at least eight to 12 pounds of methamphetamine were concealed within their vehicles. The complaint further alleges that one of the drivers, Alvaro Dominguez, used methamphetamine proceeds to make a series of cash withdrawals and to pay for the car. The SEC alleges that the driver, Maria Diaz, and another driver, Francisco Cano-Salgado, aided and abetted this scheme. The defendants allegedly stole approximately $14,500 in illicit proceeds from the transactions. The court also found that, based on the evidence presented to the court, Navarres was liable for a four-level increase in his base offense. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. The final judgment also imposed a penalty of $192,000, with the amount of disgorgement to be determined by the court at a later date.
