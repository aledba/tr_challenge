  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a third-party claims administrator for allegedly failing to adequately assess a client\u2019s ability to perform his job duties.  According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Kevin McMillan, a Senior IT Client Consultant at AT&T Corporation, was denied long-term disability benefits in May 2013.  The complaint alleges that the administrator, Dr. David Hinkamp, was unable to perform all of the job duties required for a client to qualify for the benefit because of insufficient physical exertion.  In addition, according to the complaint, McMillian submitted a medical note from April through June 2013 stating that he had developed shortness of breath and had difficulty walking or standing for long periods of time, and that he was symptomatic with dyspnea on exertion and should be considered disabled as of 4/22/2013.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint or the facts of the case, the administrator consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17. \u00c2\u00a0On May 5, 2014, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered the administrator to return to work on June 12, 2013, after which he would be required to provide a full and fair review of his claims.  On August 22, 2013 the court issued an order suspending the suspension of the suspension pending final approval by the court.  This order also prohibits the appointment of an independent consultant to evaluate a client based on his or her work performance.
