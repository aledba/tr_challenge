  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Riverside County, California, on a motion to strike against the county for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  The SEC's complaint alleges that on September 15, 2015, Brandon M. was admitted to Riverside County Regional Medical Center on an involuntary hold after he attacked his mother with a pair of scissors. The complaint alleges the medical center released Brandon before 72 hours had elapsed, before the expiration of 72 hours.  According to the complaint, Brandon returned to his family's home, where he bludgeoned his father, uncle, and alarm company technician to death with a baseball bat.

The complaint also alleges the County failed to provide reasonable proof that Brandon had been properly restrained by a licensed medical professional, and failed to disclose that he had been restrained by an alarm company employee who was installing an alarm system in the family home at the time.  It also alleges that, contrary to the Commission's order, the County did not meet its burden of proof on the basis of the evidence presented to it by the Commission, and that the Commission failed to adequately evaluate Brandon, failed to consider his medical history, and did not provide reasonable evidence for the Commission to determine whether he had reasonable cause to be released.
