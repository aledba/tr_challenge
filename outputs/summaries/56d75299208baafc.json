  "summary": "On March 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, alleges that, before this announcement was made, its members were entitled to a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) before they could participate in the collection of information related to citizenship status.  According to the complaint, before the announcement of the PIA, EPIC's members were not required to submit a PIA before the collection was completed.  In addition, the complaint alleges that EPIC failed to show that its members suffered a concrete and particularized privacy injury when they refused to answer \"any of the questions\" on the census responses.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Commission on Election Integrity has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins EPIC from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders EPIC to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  EPIC has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of money owed to the agency in the civil injunctive relief proceeding.  Additionally, the court granted the request for an emergency asset freeze and asset freeze, and ordered EPIC and its members to comply with the court's order.  On May 2, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court against EPIC, alleging that it violated Section 208 of the federal securities laws and that it failed to adequately assess whether EPIC had suffered a serious privacy injury in the form of a delayed PIA. The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 206(3).  The complaint seeks a court-ordered injunction, a court injunction, and an emergency court order prohibiting the collection and dissemination of nonpublic information, as well as an order requiring the agency to provide an accurate and timely accounting of all available information in its collection and distribution of the requested information.  To learn more about the subject matter of Section 208, see Public Interest Litigation Release No. 523 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  In a related matter, the Court issued an order suspending the issuance of a subpoena for the purpose of obtaining a court order halting the collection"
