  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against two former executives of a Houston-based health care company for their roles in a scheme to defraud the federal workers' compensation fund.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, on July 11, 2013, Federal Work Ready (FWR) and its former CFO, Jeffrey Rose, agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(3) of Exchange Act Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The complaint alleges that Rose and Sanders violated Section 982(a)(7) and Exchange Act Rules 206(8) and (9) thereunder by failing to comply with certain provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 13 of the Exchange Act, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Market Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
