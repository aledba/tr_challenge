  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas today entered a final judgment in favor of Cleartrac, LLC, Lanrick Real Estate, LLC (Lanrick), Lanrick Contractors Corp., Hudson Holdings, LLC and Thomas P. McKellar (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d) in a civil injunctive action filed on August 26, 2010, against Lanrick. The court found that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, which is the amount owed to the parties in the Texas Judgment. The Court also found that there is no subject matter jurisdiction over the case because there is an identical pending state court proceeding that has progressed to the point of a judgment dismissing Plaintiffs' claims.  According to the court's order, on August 13, 2019, the Louisiana state court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains or enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the Western District of Louisiana, charges the defendants with violating the securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order, an injunction, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Attorney General's Office in this matter."
