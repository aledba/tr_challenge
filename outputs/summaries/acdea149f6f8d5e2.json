  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Police Pension Fund against Grevirlene Kersellius, a New York City Police Department officer who was recently diagnosed with cancer.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan on February 12, 2014 and unsealed on February 24, 2014, Kerselliu was among the first officers to be diagnosed with a stroke.  The complaint alleges that, on June 20, 2010, the New York State Department of Health and Human Services (DOH) issued an order requiring the Department of Justice to determine whether a person should be entitled to a line-of-duty accident disability retirement (ADR) based on medical evidence.  In its order, the DoH issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the DOH, and ordering the department to pay a civil penalty of $5,000.  On February 26, 2019, the court granted the request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the department of health and human services to issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the allocation of ADR benefits.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the department has consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The order also prohibits the department from appointing an officer or director of a public agency as a receiver of ADRs. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Justice's Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Bratton and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.N. Secret Service in this matter.  For further information, see Press Release No. 5, 2018."
