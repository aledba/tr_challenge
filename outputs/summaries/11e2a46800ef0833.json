  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Smart-Fill Management Group, Inc. (\"Smart-Fill\"), a Florida-based microcap issuer, for failing to timely file an objection to discharge and dischargeability of debt on a federal holiday.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 16, 2018, Smart- Fill sought an emergency court order to extend the deadline for filing a complaint against the debtor until a specific date.  The SEC alleges that the court granted the request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an emergency fund to expedite the filing of the complaint.  As alleged in the complaint, the court's order extended the deadline by one day, even though the deadline fell on a legal holiday or weekend.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On January 20, 2018 the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest and pay civil penalties in the amount of $150,000, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit and supervised by Marc Blau of the Atlanta Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Texas Department of Banking and Securities and Investments in this matter."
