  "summary": "On September 14, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against The New York Times Company and two executives for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that The Times and two senior executives at the Times, Mark Thompson and Meredith Levien, discriminated against them on the basis of race, age, and, in Ms. Walker's case, disability, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1940 (\"Advisers\") and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1933 (\"Retirements\").  According to the complaint, the Times and Thompson and Levien also violated the class certification provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Exchange Act and Rules 5(b)(5) and 17a-1 thereunder, and the class-action provisions of Rule 23(a)(1) and (3) thereunder of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In addition, the court has ordered the Times to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  On October 18, 2018, the SEC filed an amended complaint against the Times alleging that the Times violated the anti-fraud provision of Rule 5a-5, and that the complaint seeks a temporary restraining order, an injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against the defendants.  To learn more about class certification violations, see Litigation Release No. 522 (2d Cir. 1998).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced parallel criminal charges against the two executives.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Office of Compliance and Assurance, with assistance from Eric Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the IRS Criminal Investigation, and other relevant agencies."
