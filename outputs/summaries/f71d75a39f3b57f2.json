  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Salvadoran man accused of defrauding his Mexican-American half sister out of more than $1 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 2014, the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) removed H.R. and his half sister, J.R., from their home in El Salvador.  According to the complaint, the court found father to be the biological father of the child and ordered DCFS to explore obtaining a DNA sample and initiate the ICPC for the child's maternal grandfather, who was also in the process of being deported.  As alleged, father had not established his biological father and did not have a current interest in the child.  In addition, the complaint alleges that father vacillated between denying and acknowledging that he was the father and that he had not had any contact with the child since he was born.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, father has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from participating in family reunification services.  Separately, the SEC filed an amended complaint in which it alleged that father violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and that the court erred in finding him liable for violating Section 9(a) of Exchange Act Rule 9b2-1 thereunder.  It also alleged that, as an alleged father, father violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder and that, by virtue of his status as a presumed father, he was not entitled to appointed counsel, custody, or to reunification with his son.  On the other hand, the amended complaint alleges, as a possible father, that father has not held himself out as a legitimate father because he had raised the child, and he has not provided evidence to support the court's finding that father was not the father.  Finally, it alleges, that, although father has consistently asserted his biological paternity, he did not provide evidence to the degree required for a judgment of biological paternity.  Further, the defendants have not cooperated with the SEC in its investigation of father-son relations, and the court has not issued an order requiring the defendants to provide proof of the father's identity and the nature of their relationship with the father in order to determine whether the court should issue an order appointing a receiver"
