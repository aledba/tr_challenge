  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma yesterday entered a final judgment finding that a licensed professional counselor violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that the Board of Professional Counselors had the authority to revoke a professional counselor's license for engaging in a romantic relationship with a client within five years after the end of the counselor/client professional relationship.  According to the court's order, the Board's decision to revoke the license was based on \"reasonable minds\" and \"capricious.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Appellant.  In its complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma, the SEC alleges that, in violation of the federal securities laws, the board violated its statutory duty to protect the safety and well-being of clients.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the Commission on Medical Competency (CMP) has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining the Board from violating the above-mentioned provisions and ordering the Commission to conduct a fair and reasonable review of the Commission's findings.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Texas granted the Commission its request for a temporary restraining order and issued an order temporarily restraining the Commission from further violations of the charged provisions, including the five-year limitation.  A hearing was held before the court in April 2017 to consider whether to proceed with the proposed administrative proceeding or to issue an order suspending or issuing a preliminary injunction.  As set forth in the order, CMP has the power to revoke or suspend a license for a period of five years upon determination that a person has engaged in unprofessional conduct in the counseling relationship. The Commission has the right to revoke any license that is related to a legitimate government interest and to determine whether to impose a penalty based on reasonable minds or capricious means.  CMP also has the ability to suspend or revoke a license issued pursuant to the provisions of the CMP. The SEC's case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, John R. Rymas, and Amy C. McKinley of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 26, 2019)."
