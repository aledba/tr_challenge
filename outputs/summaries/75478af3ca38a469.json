  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Shreveport man accused of orchestrating a second-degree murder.  According to the SEC's complaint, on July 28, 2014, William David Singleton was arrested at Margaritaville Casino in Bossier City, Louisiana. Singleton told the SEC that he and his co-defendant, Shavez Taylor, were going to the casino to play blackjack when they were confronted by two men who demanded money from Singleton. The complaint alleges that Singleton entered the casino and demanded money, and that Taylor and Singleton followed him out of the casino. The SEC alleges that the two men entered the apartment at approximately 11:30 p.m. and began shooting at Singleton and Lynn, who were later arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment.  Singleton's attorney, Eric Farquhar, agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by James Tilley with the assistance of John Rymas of the Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Tilley and Ms. O'Neal. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.
