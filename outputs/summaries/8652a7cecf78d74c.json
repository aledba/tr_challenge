  "summary": "On April 5, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a final judgment against Estar Technologies Ltd. (\"Estar\"), a Swiss manufacturer of medical and pharmaceutical products, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Estar and its subsidiary, Healeon Medical, Inc. (\"Healeon\"), raised the issue of whether Estar had sufficient purposeful contacts with New York-based doctors to determine whether the company was subject to reasonable jurisdiction.  The complaint alleges that Estar's sales of products to New York were not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the federal securities laws.  Estar also allegedly failed to disclose that its sales of the accused products were being handled out of its New York home office.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.    The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael O'Brien of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service (FINRA), and the Texas Secretary of State's Office."
