  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the City of Jacksonville, Arkansas, the Jacksonville Police Department, and its officer-in-charge, Billy D. Stair, III, in a civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Arkansas on July 23, 2013, Stair was the first to respond on the scene, where he found Jackson walking with another group of men. The complaint alleges that Stair immediately deployed his Taser and ordered Jackson to turn around, but Jackson did not comply with the officer\u2019s orders. The SEC alleges that after the second tasing, Jackson began to yell and point toward one of the men, who was trying to handcuff him. As alleged in the complaint, Jackson then raised his right fist and kicked his legs out, signaling that he would be tased again.  The SEC further alleges that Officer Stair did not respond to the officers\u2019 requests for his badge number or a written warning, and that he did not engage in any aggressive or non-resisting conduct.  In addition, the complaint alleged that the Taser-mounted video evidence clearly shows that Jackson was several feet away from the nearest officer, unable to pose a threat to law enforcement, or to the safety of an officer.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000 each. The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 574 F.3d at 496 (8th Cir. 2010).  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a civil penalty against Stair. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Stairs.  On November 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil action in federal district court against Jackson, charging him with violations of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 12b-20, and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The court granted the SEC preliminary and permanent injunctions against further violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordered Stair to pay a $20,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject"
