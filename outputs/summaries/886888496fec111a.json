  "summary": "On January 30, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against the City of Philadelphia and Edward Drach, a certified residential appraiser, in a tax sale case arising from delinquent real estate taxes.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Hart was the record owner of a property located at 26 Apsley Street, Philadelphia, Pa. (the Property).  The court found that Hart lacked standing to challenge the property's sale price because, given the $35,000 in municipal liens that Hart owed to the property, he did not have equity in the Property to protect and was not personally liable for any of the unpaid municipal lienses.  The Court also found that, based on Hart's testimony, the property was grossly inadequate.  In its order, the court found, without admitting or denying the allegations in Hart's amended petition, that the Property was grossly insufficient to meet the fair market value of the property and that Hart was not entitled to reimbursement for the expenditures that he made to improve the Property after he purchased the Property.    In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued an order suspending the sale of the Property pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's order temporarily enjoins Hart from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $1,100 in disgorgement plus $100,000 prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $20,000.  On February 14, 2017, the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia granted Hart's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to comply with the court order, which also ordered that he comply with a court order prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any municipal property for a period of five years, and ordering him to submit an amended petition to set aside the property pursuant to the MCTLA for gross inadequacy.  To settle the SEC's case, Hart has agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering that he pay $10,000 of his personal property taxes, and requiring him to provide a copy of the final judgment to the Court.  He has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to a penny stock bar.  This settlement is subject to court approval. "
