  "summary": "On September 9, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Hawaii entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on August 20, 2015, the Maui Police Department's Specialized Emergency Enforcement Detail (SPEED) convoy encountered a number of individuals standing shoulder to shoulder blocking the road, preventing the convoy from entering the area. The complaint alleges that the SPEED team approached the individuals and asked them to move off the roadway, which they did not do. As alleged in the complaint, Kauhane did not comply with the order and instead continued to obstruct the roadway. The SEC alleges that, in a parallel action, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from future violations of the Exchange Act, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The court also ordered the defendant to pay disgorgement of $20,000, prejudgment interest of $1,500, and a $100,000 civil penalty.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by David A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Hawai'i, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice."
