  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Andrew Kimble Collinsworth, Jr., a former nurse at the Texarkana Surgery Center, in which he agreed to be the sole managing conservator of the children's home.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, from 2011 through 2018, Andrew and Allison split their retirement accounts, which included the marital home. According to the complaint, after the split, Andrew allegedly spent $15,000.00 of his retirement savings on gambling, drugs, and child support. The complaint further alleges that Andrew spent the rest of the money on personal expenses, including his car payments and car payments, and used the remainder to make payments on his credit card bills and to pay his child support arrearage.  In addition, the complaint alleges that after the separation, Andrew continued to break into the home and steal items from it, including a pair of guns, knives, guitar studs, and clothing.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Andrew's drug use and fault in the breakup of the marriage resulted in the disproportionate share of community assets that he received from Allison.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC complaint, Andrew consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $6,815.00 plus prejudgment interest of $2,500.00, and a civil penalty of $700.00. The judgment also orders Andrew to pay a $1,176.48 monthly mortgage on the home, a $250.00 tax return, and an anticipated tax refund.  On the same day, Andrew pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a controlled substance and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  He has also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.
