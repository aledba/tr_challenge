  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Kent Julin, Ph.D., a certified arborist with 32 years of professional experience, for his role in tree maintenance at Lake Mendocino.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 5, 2014, at the request of the California Secretary of State's Office, the U. S. Forest Service (\"Securities and Exchange Commission\") and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"Bureau of Indian Affairs\"), the Forest Service's Office of Inspector General (\"OIG\"), the California Department of Natural Resources (\"DNR\"), the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), and the California Office of Inspections and Examinations (OIE) that administers the agency's Forest Service Tree Maintenance Program.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of Tree Maintenance and Removal Program (FTP), the Forest Services had the right to design and implement a tree maintenance program that included tree maintenance.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that the federal agency did not have a policy for tree maintenance that required it to identify and remove hazard trees.  As alleged in the complaint, Forest Service employees routinely inspected and removed trees in the course of their day-to-day work.  For example, in one instance, a tree fell on a campground and injured a member of the camp staff.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the federal complaint, the United States consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also granted the request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Christopher Schooley and supervised by Jennifer Chun Barry of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Chun Barry and Ms. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in this matter."
