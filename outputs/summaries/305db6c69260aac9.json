  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Jafari \"Jaf\" Boss, a Columbia, Missouri man who was convicted of seven felony counts of robbery in the first degree, seven counts of armed criminal action, and one count of unlawful use of a weapon.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbia, Mo., alleges that, on October 29, 2014, Boss entered the LaQuinta Inn with a plastic mask and carrying a.45-caliber pistol. The complaint alleges that he entered the hotel room and held the overnight employee at gunpoint and directed the employee to retrieve money in the hotel's cash drawer, before fleeing the hotel. According to the complaint, Boss's entry of the judgment violated Section 490.065 of the federal securities laws, and the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 5b-5(b) and (c) thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Columbia today announced criminal charges against Boss.  On December 17, 2017, the trial court granted the SEC's request for a two-month continuance to determine whether to impose a penalty for Boss's violations of the charged provisions of the securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Boss consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, and orders him to pay a penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about how to apply for a court-ordered injunction, see Litigation Release No. 598 (Feb. 13, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Kurt L. Gottschall of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office. The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office and the Missouri Department of Criminal Justice."
