  "summary": "On March 7, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Village of Canton for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York City, the Commission on the District of Columbia issued an order requiring the Village to comply with the federal and state anti-fraud laws.  The Commission's order, which was entered on February 11, 2019 and unsealed on March 13, 2020, found that the Commission violated the First Amendment and the federal securities laws by failing to enforce the Commission's orders.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the Church of Christ, a New York not-for-profit corporation founded in 1974, and a New Jersey-based entity, Opulent Life, Inc. (now based in Pembroke, New York).  The complaint alleges that, in violation of the Commission\u2019s order, the Church violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and that it violated Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-3 thereunder, Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17(b)(3)(A) thereunder and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission&rsquo;s complaint, the Village has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  It also has agreed to pay a $20,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000 and a $50,000 penalty in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On March 8, 2019 the Commission issued its order imposing a temporary restraining order, prohibiting the Church from using the property as a church, and ordering the Commission to determine whether to issue an order suspending the church from the downtown area for a period of five years. The Commission also ordered the Church to provide an accounting of its financial condition and to provide a copy of its annual report to the Commission as well as other information about the church and its obligations under Section 15a-3.  As part of the settlement, the commission agreed to a permanent injunction and to the payment of a $10 million civil penalty."
