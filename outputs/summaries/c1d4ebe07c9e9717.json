  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Colorado today entered a final judgment in favor of moving defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by a former employee of the University of Colorado.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that Joseph Tumpkin violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he violated the duty of care provision of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, from approximately December 2013 to November 2016, Tumpkins repeatedly engaged in abusive and aggressive behavior toward a third party.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, while employed as an Assistant Coach for the University's football team in February 2015, he began \"physically, psychologically[,] and verbally abusing Plaintiff\" and a \"pattern of abuse followed thereafter, through November 2016.\"  The complaint also alleges that during this period, Tumpingkin choked Plaintiff and expressed concern that he would kill himself, her, or someone else.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal laws, require them to pay disgorgement of $75,000, and impose civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000 for each of the defendants' violations of the charged provisions, and requires them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $150,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Perreira and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Denver Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance, the Colorado Department of Health and Human Services, and the Colorado Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
