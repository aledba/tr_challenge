  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Sergio Briseno Medina, a Colorado man accused of orchestrating a double murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Medina, who lives in Denver, Colorado, made several unprovoked statements to two officers during an interrogation conducted by the Denver Police Department.  According to the complaint, Medina allegedly told the officers that he was going to talk to them about the murder and asked them to check his hands. The complaint alleges that the officers asked Medina to do a couple of things when he was in the vicinity of the victim's body and her jeep around the time of the murder. Medina allegedly replied, \u201cI'm gonna answer questions.\u201d  The complaint further alleges that one of the officers questioned Medina about his involvement in the murder, and Medina replied that he did not know what was going on.  Medina also allegedly claimed that he had been threatened by his mother and her mother for years, and that his mother had been threatening him for years about reporting inappropriate conduct between himself and her.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Medina.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Medina consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Medina to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. Medina also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the sale or purchase of any security. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Utah Court of Appeals issued an order suspending Medina from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The court also ordered Medina to provide an accounting of his role in the alleged double murder and ordered him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Utah State Attorney General's Office, and the Denver Field Office of Criminal Investigations in this matter."
