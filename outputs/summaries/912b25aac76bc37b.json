  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Tag Seog Lee for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that, from at least 2008 through at least November 2016, Kim and his wife purchased an existing printing business called Grip Smart Printing, Inc.

Ricchiute of the SEC issued a preliminary injunction against Kim, ordering him to comply with the court order. On May 19, 2017 the court granted a request for a temporary injunction against the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order, ordering Kim to surrender his passport and to pay a $1,500 civil penalty.
