  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against the defendants.  The court's order, which was entered on May 24, 2015, permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia today entered final judgments against defendants who failed to show up for court-ordered in-court identifications.  According to the court's orders, the defendants had no reasonable expectation of being able to identify themselves in court and, instead, relied upon the testimony of two brothers who had been previously barred from appearing before the court as part of a criminal case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Court's judgments, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws and order them to pay civil penalties of up to $1,000,000. The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any security deposit or other security deposit, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlements are subject to court approval. The Court's order also prohibits defendants from imposing any monetary penalty or asset freeze. The court also ordered the defendants not to violate the due process provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Elizabeth F. Loftus and Glenn S. Gordon of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Colorado Office of Professional and Risk Analysis."
