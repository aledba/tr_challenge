  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against the Florida Department of Education, the Florida Secretary of State's Office, and the Florida Commissioner of Education in a related action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that Florida violated its duty to provide a \"uniform, efficient and high quality\" education to millions of Florida students.  According to the complaint, Florida's education policies and funding were inadequate and did not meet the requirements of the federal and state education laws.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Florida Board of Education failed to adequately evaluate the adequacy, efficiency, and quality of Florida's public education system.  Specifically, the court found that Florida's school choice programs violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal, state, and local laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their civil penalties.  Finally, the Court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, as well as an order appointing a receiver to oversee the implementation of the Florida education policies.  It also granted the parties' motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2017."
