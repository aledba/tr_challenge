  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey yesterday entered summary judgment in favor of Ford Motor Company on all of Coba's claims.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, N.J., alleges that, beginning in 2001, Ford received waves of complaints from customers who purchased certain of its trucks reporting similar types of delamination problems. The complaint alleges that Ford knew and did not disclose that fuel tanks in certain Ford trucks had delaminated, which Ford attributed to \"unique qualities in regional fuel supplies\" that Ford recommended against using because its tanks were not authorized to withstand biodiesel concentrations over 5%. Ford also allegedly failed to adequately repair and replace his fuel tanks, as alleged in the complaint.  According to the complaint, Ford also failed to disclose to its customers that its fuel tank coatings were defective, and that it had not replaced the tanks at all.  In a parallel action, on March 4, 2017, the United States District Court in New Jersey entered a summary judgment against Ford, finding that Coba violated the federal securities laws by failing to adequately disclose to Ford and other customers that the fuel tank coating was a design defect.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Coba consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $5,000,000 plus prejudgment interest of $2,500, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 12-1622, 2017 WL 3332264, No. 13-14 (D.N.J. Feb. 11, 2016).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Kurt L. Gottschall of the New Jersey Office of Financial Regulation."
