  "summary": "On August 20, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against convicted felon Josener Dorisca, finding him liable for a second-degree murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, alleges that, on June 8, 2008, the defendant, Bensney Toussaint, of Brockton, Mass., made a false statement to a jury in the closing argument in which he claimed that he saw Rodley Doriscat shoot a fellow cookout-goer with a gun.  According to the complaint, the jury deliberated for less than two hours before finding that the defendant had been shot in the chest and abdomen.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Massachusetts today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendant's assets and prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On August 19, 2018 the Honorable Margaret S. McCole granted the SEC the right to proceed with its investigation, including an examination of the evidence in the case.  To learn more about this matter, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1184 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Boston Regional Office."
