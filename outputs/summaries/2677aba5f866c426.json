  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a pain management physician who performed a diagnostic nerve block injection procedure on Mrs. Sappington's cervical spine.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, on November 9, 2012, the jury found that defendants failed to prove the standard of care for obtaining informed consent to the injections at the C2-3 level of her spine. The court also found that the jury did not find sufficient evidence to show that a reasonable person would not have consented to injections at that level.  The SEC alleges that Dr. Hubbell, who performed the procedure, failed to adequately disclose the material risks of the injections, including nerve injury, numbness, pain, cerebrospinal fluid leak, and spinal headache.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hubbell agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Hubbell and his company, Southern Pain and Anesthesia Consultants, LLC. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Dolan and Ms. Messina. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 5-477 (La. App. 5 Cir. 1/13/09). The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom's Ministry of Health, the U.K. Secret Service, and the United Nations Health and Human Services."
