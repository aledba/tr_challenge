  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against Matt Daniels and various associated entities in a settled settlement case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, the Daniels Parties breached their obligations under the settlement agreement by failing to timely pay $178,561 in the amount of $100,000.  The complaint alleges that, as part of the settlement, Matt Daniels agreed to pay $10,000 per month as satisfaction for the initial payment.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this payment was not made as anticipated by the parties.  In fact, the complaint alleges, as a result of this settlement agreement, neither Daniels Parties were entitled to a penny-per-month payment, and the payment in question was not paid in full.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount owed to them under the settled settlement agreement.  Additionally, the judgment orders the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $2,000,000 and $1,500, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Department of Justice Criminal Division's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, as well as the Ohio Office of Financial Regulation and the Ohio Department of Insurance. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The case has been supervised by Amy S. Cotter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 17, 2016)."
