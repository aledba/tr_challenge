  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a Connecticut man who was expelled from the University of Connecticut for making a series of threatening statements on a public university campus.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that Austin Haughwout, a former student at the university, made several statements to a group of college students during a visit to the university's student center on September 17, 2015. Among other things, the complaint alleges that the student made numerous \"jokingly\" statements to one of the students, including that he planned to take his grandfather's nine millimeter gun from a cabinet and bring it to school to shoot people who had bullied and teased him. The complaint further alleges that, despite having access to a.357 Magnum, the student had never shown any weapons on his person, and that he had \"a habit of making threatening hand gestures as a form of greeting to students in the student center.\"  The court also found that, contrary to the claims in the complaint, the plaintiff's statements and gestures were not true threats because they were made in the context of a serious threat to the school community.  In addition, the court found that the plaintiff had no reasonable basis to believe that he was making these statements, and therefore could not be relied upon to determine whether he was a true threat.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 26, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Education, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Office of Education."
