  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found liable for a long-term, undisclosed history of PTSD.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on March 23, 2019, John R. Johnson III, a former Army officer, was diagnosed with PTSD in 2011.  The complaint alleges that Mr. Johnson, who served in Iraq for one year, suffered from PTSD symptoms ranging from hypervigilence, irritability, and agitation, and that he frequently had nightmares, had difficulty concentrating, and had difficulty communicating with others.  In addition, according to the complaint, he had a history of \"flipping out\" and \"kick[ing] in the door of a semi\" in 2013 because the driver had not properly sealed up the back of a truck with a tag.  As a result of his PTSD, Mr.Johnson was unable to participate in routine work, such as grocery shopping, housework, and housekeeping.  He also had difficulty maintaining a balance between work and personal life, including frequent bouts of anxiety, stress, and panic attacks.  On one occasion, while working as a security guard at a VA hospital, he was confronted by a supervisor who told him to \"stop doing that.\"  The supervisor allegedly told him not to do that because he had \"trouble concentrating on the task at hand.\"  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant, barring him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $20,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, imposes a $25,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  A final judgment ordering a permanent injunction against further violations of these provisions orders orders a permanent conduct-based injunction against future violations, and orders him to return to duty as a control person.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Riggs and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Rogers, Ms. Gibson, and Ms. Brunson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Alabama Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
