  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment against Andrew J. Fede, a former Cliffside Park Police Department officer who was convicted of obstruction of the administration of law for failing to remove the chain lock from his door.  The court found that Fede violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that, contrary to Fede's prior convictions, Fede did not obstruct the officers' entry into his home. Instead, the court found Fede liable for violating the emergency-aid provision of the federal securities laws and ordered Fede to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Fede agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The judgment also prohibits Fede from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with a criminal conviction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey announced criminal charges against Fede. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Newark, N.J., charges Fede with violating Section 206 of the Exchange Act, and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and civil penalties. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Department of Justice, and the FBI in this matter."
