  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against Gerrell Washington, a Louisiana man who was convicted of second degree battery, a violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Washington, ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Louisiana, on May 1, 2017, the defendant, Ruddio Rico, a sixty-eight-year-old vet who worked with his wife as a volunteer at the Bunkie Senior Center, was sentenced to five years at hard labor for second-degree battery. The SEC alleges that the defendant was afraid of the victim and threatened to \"plant him in the ground\" if he ever called his wife a \"b-i-t-c-h\" again. In addition, the complaint alleges that he used a dangerous weapon during the beating and that the victim followed him and tried to grab his shirt. The complaint further alleges that when confronted by the victim's wife, the victim told her husband that he \"cussed\" at her and threatened her when she told him not to pressure wash near the cracks of the windows. The victim also allegedly told the defendant that he had \"no violence in [his] jacket\" in almost twenty years of incarceration.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Rico.  On September 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Rico, charging him with violating Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Rico consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar, and imposes a 10-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, including securities in the securities of any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Jennifer C. Magee, Eric R. Werner, and Patrick J. McCluskey of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by"
