  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) against Mosaic, a Florida-based phosphate mining company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that, in 2010 and 2011, the federal agency issued a Section 404 permit for the discharge of phosphate, a radioactive byproduct of phosphate mining. The complaint alleges that the Corps failed to consider the direct and indirect effects of the discharge, such as the effects of phosphogypsum-related fertilizer production and storage, when it issued the permit. According to the complaint, the Corps also failed to adequately consider the downstream effects of mining phosphate, which is a significant cause of the decline in phosphate production. In addition, the complaint further alleges that Mosaic failed to take into account the fact that it was not required to consider any of the downstream environmental effects of its mining activities. The court also ruled that, as alleged in Public Citizen, the Commission lacked the authority to determine whether the discharge was necessary to prevent the decline of phosphate production or the creation and storage of phosphate. The Court also found that the Commission had no jurisdiction over the application of the permit, nor did it have the jurisdiction to determine the timing and nature of the application. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, charging Mosaic with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being handled by John Rymas of the SEC's Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica and Ms. Scarlato of the Market Abuse Unit. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.N. Office of Environmental Quality, and the Florida Department of Fish and Wildlife."
