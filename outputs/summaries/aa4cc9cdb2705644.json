  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in the MARDOC litigation against various ship-owners and asbestos manufacturers and suppliers.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Ohio in 1989, the defendants filed motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 1407 of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that Judge John R. Robreno, who was presiding over the case at the time, improperly ruled that certain defendants did not waive their defense of \"personal jurisdiction\" by filing motions to transfer their cases to a different court for trial.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this finding was inconsistent with the court\u2019s finding that defendants had waived their defense.  In its judgment, the court ruled that the defendants should be immediately transferred to the appropriate court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains the defendants from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.    The SEC complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 1408 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities laws, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants, as well as a civil injunctive action against each of them. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Attorney General's Office, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 8, 1991).  The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Mr. Brannan."
