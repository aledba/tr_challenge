  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against the University of Illinois' Board of Trustees, finding that department chairs are not managerial employees as defined by the federal agency's policies and practices.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Springfield, Illinois, alleges that the university violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the complaint, the university's policy requires department chairs to be \"engaged predominantly in executive and management functions\" when performing their departmental duties.  For example, the complaint alleges that, in certain departments, department chairs spent a significant portion of their time on administrative duties, such as hiring, supervising, and evaluating adjunct faculty.  In other instances, the complaints alleged that the department chairs did not spend a preponderance of their employment time supervising adjunct faculty, as required by the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's Complaint, the University has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the university from violating the federal securities laws, orders the university to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and requires the institution to pay an officer and director bar in the amount of $150,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Department of Education, the Illinois State Labor Relations Board, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
