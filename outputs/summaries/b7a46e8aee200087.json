  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota today announced criminal charges against a Woodbury, Minnesota resident for defrauding the city of Woodbury of $1.389 million by failing to condition approval of a subdivision application upon payment of the infrastructure charge.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Minnesota, in July 2015, Martin Harstad submitted an application to Woodbury for approval to subdivide and develop a 183-unit residential community called Bailey Park. The complaint alleges that Woodbury agreed to pay a $1,389,444 infrastructure charge based on the location of the proposed development and the cost of all of the \"road improvements\" that a city may impose on approval of the subdivision application.  The complaint further alleges that, in reality, Woodbury has no statutory authority to impose an infrastructure charge on any subdivision application because it is not a form of financial security as contemplated in the federal law.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Woodbury that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Woodbury to comply with the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the city agreed to a permanent injunction prohibiting it from imposing or denying any of the above-mentioned charges. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Minnesota Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Minnesota Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
