  "summary": "On January 7, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against two insurance companies for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Illinois Union Insurance Company (Illinois Union) and Starr Indemnity & Liability Company (Starr) failed to provide coverage for Sanders's underlying claim of malicious prosecution arising out of a December 1993 shooting.  According to the complaint, Sanders was wrongly convicted of murder, attempt (murder), and armed robbery arising from that shooting and was later exonerated.  In addition, the complaint alleges that members of the city's police department manipulated and coerced false witness identifications of Sanders as being involved in a criminal case and withheld exculpatory information in connection with his prosecution.  As alleged, Sanders's exoneration was triggered by the completion of a tort that he was convicted of, rather than the beginning of a new one.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to pay $15 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their respective civil penalties.  Additionally, the settlement is pending final approval by the court.  On January 8, the SEC filed a second amended complaint, this time against Illinois Union and Starr, alleging that the insurance companies violated the anti-fraud provision of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding and abetting the violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder.  This amended complaint also alleges that the Illinois Union policies provided coverage for the purpose of recovering from defendants, the City of Waukegan, who were later found liable for the same conduct.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 6, 2019).  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and penny stock bars against the defendants, as well as injunctive relief against the relief defendants, and an officer-and-director bar against the rest of the defendants.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Insurance, the Chicago Police Department, and the Illinois Attorney General's Office in this matter."
