  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of New Jersey resident Thomas E. St. Pierre, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, N.J., alleges that, from at least 2013 through at least 2015, the New Jersey Secretary of State's Office (\"Securities and Exchange Commission\") issued an order requiring New Jersey residents to pay tolls in the form of a \"transaction\" to collect a \"debt.\"  According to the SEC's order, however, the obligation to pay the tolls arises out of a transactional transaction, not from the collection of a debt.  For example, as alleged in the complaint, the exemption from the federal obligation does not apply to the payment of tolls arising from a transaction in which the amount of the obligation is determined by the person or entity responsible for the obligation.  In addition, the court found that, contrary to the stated intent of the SEC, St.Pierre failed to make that showing because he alleged only a de minimis procedural violation of the FDCPA and not an injury-in-fact.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s order, the SEC has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins New Jersey from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders the state to pay a civil penalty of $50,000, which is equal to the amount owed to the individual in the civil penalty. The SEC also agreed to a settlement where it will determine whether it is appropriate for the individual to pay his or her obligations under the federal law.  On the same day that the SEC issued its order, a federal district court in New Jersey entered an order ordering New Jersey to pay $1,200,000 in civil penalties to a private debt collection agency, which, in turn, assigned the amount to be determined by a court at a later date. The court also ordered New Jersey Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to provide an accounting of the unpaid tolls that he received from the agency.  Schneiderman agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations. The settlement is subject to court approval. The Court also ordered that Schneiderman be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and ordered to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $2,078.50, which includes a $100,000 civil penalty, a $50 per hour penalty, and a $75,000 penalty.  Finally, the Court ordered"
