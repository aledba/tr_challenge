  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment in favor of a mandatory life sentence for a juvenile who was convicted of an aggravated murder.  The court also issued an order suspending the issuance of a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against each of them.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Portland, Oregon, on April 1, 1995, the District Court entered a preliminary injunction against imposing a mandatory minimum sentence of life without parole on a juvenile for the purpose of determining whether or not to impose the mandatory minimum.  In its order, the court also ordered that the amount of the sentence imposed be determined by the court at a later date.  As alleged in the court order, however, the amount and severity of the penalty imposed on a defendant is dependent on the defendant's age, the severity of his or her criminal history, and other factors in determining whether to impose a penalty at the time of the crime.  For example, as set forth in the order, if a defendant was a child when he or she committed an act of aggravated murder, he would be eligible to be sentenced as an adult.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $25,000, which is equal to the amount that he will be sentenced to in adult court.  Additionally, the judge granted the request for a temporary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordered the sentencing of the defendant to be conducted in a manner that is consistent with the pre-judgmental nature of the case.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Roper, Thomas Grisso, Marsha Levick, and Laurence Steinberg of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Ms. Levick and Ms. Skola.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oregon Department of Corrections, and the Oregon State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
