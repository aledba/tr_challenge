  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment in favor of the Maryland Attorney General's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in its ongoing investigation of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that, from at least May 2017 through November 2018, the Attorney General and Department of Justice issued an order suspending the issuance of an emergency court order temporarily freezing the assets of three companies and thirteen Russian nationals.  According to the complaint, the court's order temporarily froze the assets and assets of the three companies, freezing their assets, and imposing a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security today announced related criminal charges against the companies and their associated entities.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 13 of the federal securities laws by failing to comply with certain of the requirements of Section 13. The complaint also alleges that defendants violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Ad Advisers\") and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, and that the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's case, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws, ordering them to pay a civil monetary penalty of $100,000, and ordering the defendants to disgorge their allegedly illegal profits and pay civil penalties of $50,000 each. The court also granted the defendants' motion for preliminary injunctions and a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 12 of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-2, and 13b3-3 thereunder; and ordered the SEC to provide an accounting of the amount of money spent on advertising in violation of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 12d-1. The SEC is continuing its investigation, which is continuing, with assistance from the Office of Compliance and Enforcement's Cyber Unit. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Cyber Unit, under the supervision of Daniel A. Kasper. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Office of Inspector General and the Maryland Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
