  "summary": "On November 19, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment in favor of Eileen T. Ffrench, the sister of Robert N. French, who was also a defendant in the 2015 Restatement case.  The court found that, in a parallel action, filed in federal district court in Miami, Florida, Brian P. and his brother, Robert N., agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the court ruled that Eileen was entitled to attorneys' fees related to Brian's unsuccessful appeal of the July 10, 2018 restatement for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  According to the court's order, Eileen and Brian were not a prevailing party and were not entitled to attorney's fees.  As a result, Brian's action was dismissed without prejudice, and Eileen has not prevailed in the overall litigation.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Eileen also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Brian's attorney, Carl Cascio, agreed to the settlement without prejudice.  He also agreed not to participate in the litigation against Eileen.  On November 21, 2019 the Honorable Judge James I. Cohn of the United States District Court in Miami issued a temporary restraining order, freezing Eileen's assets, and ordering Eileen to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  Judge Cohn's order also prohibits Eileen from participating in any litigation involving a defendant other than for the purpose of recovering her allegedly ill-gotten gains.   The SEC's complaint charges Eileen with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00a0the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations.  Additionally, the complaint charges Brian with violating Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and Rule 15a-3 thereunder and seeks an injunction against further violations of that provision, as well as an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar against Brian.
