  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Richard R., a convicted sex offender who has been charged by the New York State Department of Mental Health with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Richard R. requested court-issued subpoenas to obtain the testimony of several senior officials within the state's Liquor Authority with counts of improper conduct.  The complaint alleges that Richard R.'s request for the subpoenas was denied because he was a \"dangerous sex offender requiring confinement.\"  The SEC alleges that, in a parallel action, on January 31, 2018, the Court granted Richard R's motion for summary judgment and ordered him to comply with the court-ordered subpoenas.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued a scheduling order setting a date for Richard R's annual review hearing less than a week after his petition was filed.  As alleged in the complaint, the scheduled hearing for August 2, 2017, was scheduled for 12:06 p.m. EST, the same date as the scheduled start of the hearing.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, however, Richard has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On February 28, 2018 the Court issued a temporary restraining order, which prohibits Richard from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, including securities in the securities industry, as well as prohibiting him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for at least five years.  A hearing scheduled for August 22, 2017 is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 10-10.09(e) (January 17, 2018).  The Commission on Addiction and Mental Health has issued an order appointing an independent examiner to determine the appropriate date for a hearing on the merits of the Commission's recommendation. The Commission has also issued an Order appointing a Judge to determine whether to issue an order requiring the appointment of an independent medical examiner.  An order appointing the independent examiner will be required by the court at a later date.  Finally, the Commission has appointed a receiver to facilitate the issuance of subpoenas, which are subject to approval by the Court.  Richard"
