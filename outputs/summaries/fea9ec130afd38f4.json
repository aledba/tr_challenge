  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against the State of North Caroliniana, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the North Carolina Commission of Indian Affairs for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that, beginning in 1983, the state entered into a 99-year lease of the property for the purpose of ultimately developing the Native American Cultural Center with the intent of acquiring the property. The complaint alleges that the lease was entered into pursuant to the 2003 federal law, and that, as a result of the state's actions, the Cultural Center was forced to abandon the property within one year of the Commission's decision to terminate the lease.  According to the complaint, the Commission and the State Defendants failed to take reasonable steps to remediate the property's problems, including failing to obtain required insurance coverage, subleasing without prior written approval, and hindering access to patrons of the course of the event.  In addition, the complaint alleges the Commission, the Department of Administration, the State Department of Commerce, the FBI, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Internal Revenue Service's Office of Inspector General, and other federal agencies violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the Commission to pay civil penalties of $1,000,000. The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 567, 662 S.E.2d (2003).  The Commission appreciates the assistance of the U.C. Department of Justice and the FBI in this matter."
