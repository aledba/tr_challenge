  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. (\"DuPont\") and its co-defendant, Dr. Robert Bahnson, for failing to adequately consider or rule out the risk factors for testicular cancer.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Jackson, W.Va., on June 7, 2016, DuPont and BahnSON agreed to settle a civil action brought by a group of approximately 80,000 individuals who alleged that they were at increased risk of developing cancer based on their exposure to C-8.  The court also found that, contrary to what the court had previously ruled, Bahnsson failed to properly consider the evidence presented in his expert report.  In addition, the court found that the evidence provided by the expert did not support his conclusion that the cancer was atypical and that he had a reasonable chance of developing the disease at a later stage.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and injunctive relief.  DuPont also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael Jahn of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Jahn. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
