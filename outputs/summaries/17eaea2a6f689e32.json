  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in favor of the District Attorney's Office's motion for summary judgment against Winston Perez Hernandez, who was convicted of attempted-battery assault in 2014.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Perez Hernandez violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, in response to Mr. Perez Hernandez's actions, he allegedly put his finger in Mr. Tarawallie's eye and then, after being asked not to touch him, hit him on the head with a beer bottle.  As alleged in the complaint, the alleged act of aggression was not a reasonable response to the defendant's actions.  In its judgment, the court found that Perez Hernandez was not liable for a simple assault under the federal securities laws, and that he had acted in self-defense by refusing to comply with the government's request.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Perez Hernandez also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $1,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maryland State Attorney General's Office, and the Maryland Office of the Attorney General."
