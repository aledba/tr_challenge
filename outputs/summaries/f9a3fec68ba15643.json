  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered summary judgment in favor of a motion for summary judgment against a California-based construction company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Milpitas, California on March 27, 2009, alleges that, in August 2008, Jerry Kielty was injured while working as a cement pump operator at a construction site.  According to the complaint, the injured employee was not insured under the company's excess policy, and the company was not required to provide coverage under its excess policy.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the company failed to show that it was entitled to coverage under the excess policy when, in fact, it did not provide coverage at the time of the accident.  As a result, the defendants were not entitled to any insurance coverage under their excess policies.  Instead, the SEC alleges that Topa and his company violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the defendants violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of National Union Insurance Company (\"NUIC\") and (3) and (4) as a result of their violations of Sections 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Topa consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $10 million in disgorgement, $1 million in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $20,000.  Separately, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Topa from further violating the antifraud provisions of Section 206, and ordered Topa to pay a $5 million civil penalty, which is equal to the amount that he has already paid to settle the employee's civil action.  Topa also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 27, 2008).  The complaint charges Topa with violating Sections 206, 206, 207, and 207 of the Insurance Act, Sections 206 and 206 of which he has agreed to pay, and Sections 206 (1), 207, 206 (2), 206 (3), and 207 (4), and that he is liable as a defendant for the amount of compensation owed to the employee.
