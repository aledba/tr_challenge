  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two individuals who are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 28, 2014, Cayuga Indian Nation of N.Y.  The complaint alleges that defendants, who are members of one of the competing factions vying for control of the Nation, unlawfully entered into a statement of support process that, among other things, denied defendants' motion for leave to reargue, issued a preliminary injunction, and granted the BIA's request to vacate the subject property.  As alleged in the complaint, defendants also failed to show sufficient evidence to support their claims that they constituted the proper governing body for the Nation under its historical governing structure.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Cayuga Nation members.  On July 14, 2017, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the U.N. District Judge in Manhattan issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing before the court and ordering them to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders them to pay civil penalties of $1,000 each.  At the same time, the court granted the defendants a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the conduct of the complaint. The order also prohibits defendants from raising any legitimate claims of legitimate governmental authority with respect to the issue of sovereign immunity, including the right to participate in the government-to-government relationship with the tribe. The SEC's order also requires defendants to show cause why they are not entitled to the same level of jurisdiction as the federal district court that issued the order. The court also ordered defendants to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Cayuga Tribal Chairman and Chief of the Board of Trustees Robert C. Hannan has agreed to settle the case without admitting, denying, or denying any of the defendants' claims. The settlement is subject to court approval. The Court's order against the defendants is pending final approval by the court.  For further information, see Cayuga Tribe v. United States, No. 13-cv-8221. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Daniel A. Kasper and Ms."
