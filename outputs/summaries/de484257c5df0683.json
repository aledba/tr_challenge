  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of second-degree battery in 2014.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that defendant Reeshawn \"T-Roc\" Arnold violated the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 15b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Arnold was a regular at The Last Call Bar when he and another defendant entered the bar the night of January 21, 2014 and were confronted by a group of men who demanded to know why they had hit the victim. The complaint alleges that the men were aggressive and aggressive, and that the victim was in a coma.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans announced criminal charges against Arnold arising from the same conduct.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities for a period of five years. The court also granted the defendant's motion for a writ of certiorari and a temporary restraining order against him from further violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of $10,000 and $20,000.  On August 1, 2018, the court granted the request for a preliminary injunction against future violations and ordered a hearing on the matter.  A hearing scheduled for September 5, 2018 was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.N. Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of the Chief of the New Orleans Division of Criminal Investigations in this matter."
