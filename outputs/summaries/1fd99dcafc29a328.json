  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against Bradley Pizza, Inc., a corporation that owns and operates the Red Wing, Minnesota Domino's Pizza franchise, and its owner, Pamela M. Dahl, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 25, 2017, Smith, who has a disability that requires him to use a wheelchair for mobility, visited a Red Wing location in May 2017 and found that the parking lot did not contain enough accessible parking spaces, and the sole parking space designated as accessible was not marked with ADAAG-compliant signage.  The complaint alleges that Smith failed to deliver the requisite documents to Dahl, who is not authorized to receive service of process.  As alleged in the complaint, Smith also alleges that the threshold to the entryway appeared to be higher than.5 inches, which is a violation of the ADA, and that Dahl failed to waive her right to show cause and effect.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Bradley and Dahl consented to the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Smith.  On January 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Katherine M. Menendez of the U.N. Division of Justice issued a temporary restraining order against Smith, freezing his assets, and barring him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  She also issued an order suspending Smith from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  To settle the SEC case, the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered him to comply with the entry-of-the-court order, and appointed a receiver to determine whether to issue a civil injunctive proceeding against Smith and to issue an order requiring him to provide a copy of the complaint to Dahl.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by\u00c2\u00a0Karpel, Ms. Werner, and Ms. Hargis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Minnesota Office of Inspector General."
