  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against defendant Douglas John Hulse, Jr., who was convicted of two felony counts of aiding and abetting a third-degree felony.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Utah, alleges that Hulse violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  In its complaint, Hulse alleges that, in 2014, the couple spent Memorial Day weekend camping in Brigham City, where they both allegedly engaged in a series of verbal and physical altercations with one another.  According to the complaint, one of the defendants had used drugs on the camping trip, and the other had been previously convicted of workers' compensation fraud in October 2011.  Hulse's complaint alleges that the two defendants continued to argue, despite the fact that they had not used any drugs that morning, and that the third defendant had threatened self-harm when confronted by the same person who had confronted him the day before.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 27, 2014, a jury found Hulse guilty of two counts of securities fraud, a class B felony, and a class C felony. He was sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  To settle the charges, the court granted Hulse a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return to the United States and pay a civil monetary penalty of $25,000. The court also ordered Hulse to pay an $80,000 penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. Hulse agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, other than for his own personal use. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2017, is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Division of Criminal Investigation, the Utah Attorney General's Office, the Salt Lake County District Attorney's Office and the Utah Office of Professional and Risk Analysis."
