  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against a Danvers man accused of stealing a car.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Lawrence, Massachusetts, alleges that, on May 21, 2006, Keith Koster was shot and killed while attempting to prevent a carjacker from stealing it.  According to the complaint, the defendant, who was then serving a life sentence for a prior felony-murder charge, entered into a plea agreement without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, and agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendant that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  A hearing on the motion for a new trial was scheduled for May 24, 2019.  On May 25, 2019, a federal district court in New York entered a temporary restraining order against Koster, ordering him to surrender his passport, and ordering a hearing on May 26, 2019 to determine whether to proceed with a criminal proceeding against him. The SEC previously issued an order freezing Koster's assets and prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged scheme to steal the car. Koster consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions, and from future securities law violations. The court also ordered Koster to comply with the court's order, which requires the court to determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC upon motion of the SEC.   The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a separate case, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against a defendant"
