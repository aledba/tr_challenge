  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Jason Keeling, a former Forest Park Police Department officer who was charged with defrauding the pension fund by failing to timely file an application for a line-of-duty disability pension.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 28, 2013, Keeling sustained injuries while working as an officer in the Village of Forest Park.  The complaint alleges that Keeling sought to preserve his right to seek a disability pension because he was no longer employed as a police officer when he filed the application.  Keeling allegedly told Keeling that he needed to complete a disability application before he resigned as a Police Officer and that he would receive an attorney's letter advising him to do so within 3 months after receiving his first appointment.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the Board did not consider Keeling's claim as unreasonable because he failed to file the designated application form.  In a parallel action, on May 23, 2016, a federal district court in Chicago issued an order suspending Keeling from serving as a member of the Police Pension Fund and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  On July 24, 2018, the court granted Keeling a temporary restraining order and ordered Keeling to return to duty as a municipal officer.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's order, he consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to repay the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $20,000 and $10,000, respectively.  Additionally, the order prohibits Keeling and Bryant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a public agency, including the right to reapply as a public employee.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5/3-114.1 (2014).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David Preiwisch and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
