  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in favor of the California Pharmacists Association (CPA) in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 2002 and 2004, the California Department of Insurance (\"DOI\") issued an order requiring pharmacy benefit managers to transmit information about pharmacy fees to their clients.  According to the complaint, this order violated the antifraud provisions of Section 2527 of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint also alleges that the DoI's order requires that pharmacists submit to the solicitation of prescriptions for a particular drug, regardless of whether the drug is branded or not.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to comply with a federal rule requiring pharmacists to submit to solicitation of prescription drug prices.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the First Amendment, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requires them to provide a copy of the Commission's order to the pharmacy benefit manager.  Finally, the court granted the CPA's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the payment of a civil penalty equal to the amount of any disgorge amount.  On May 12, 2018, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans of the United Kingdom entered a final judgement against the defendants, permanently enjoining them from future violations of the First and Order 1099-1, and ordering them to disgorge their allegedly unlawful profits.  As part of the settlement, CPA agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any prescription drug, including, without limitation, the issuance of a cease-and-desist order.  CPA also agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Brian L. Walkup and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr.Walkup and Mr. Washburn, and the case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service, the U."
