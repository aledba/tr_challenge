  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Renaldo Champagne, a Florida resident who was convicted of two felony counts of robbery with a firearm.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Champagne from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, Champagne was sentenced to a total of 24 years in prison for the first- and second-degree felonies he committed. The court found that Champagne qualified as a three-time violent felony offender and imposed a life sentence on the second- and third-degree felony convictions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court agreed that the LPS is an individual minimum sentence that must be imposed when the offender is convicted of a primary or additional felony, and that the minimum sentence for any additional offense must not exceed the statutory maximum.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against him.  Among other things, the SEC charged Champagne with violating Section 921.0024(2) and (3) and 13(a)(1) and charged him with violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Miami Regional Office and supervised by Scott A. Thompson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Banking and Securities and Investments."
