  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against Georgia State Representative Gina H. Wright and her husband, R. Brian Strickland, for unlawfully redrawing state House Districts 105 and 111.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta on March 5, 2015, Ms. Wright, a member of the Georgia State Conference of the NAACP, and two other members of the House Reapportionment Office (ROHO) raised the issue of race and gerrymandering.  The complaint alleges that the ROHO redrawed the districts in 2011 and 2012, when the U. S. House of Representatives redrew them.  As alleged in the complaint, the new districts were designed to protect the incumbents in the neighboring districts, and to give them an edge in terms of percentage of black and Latino voters.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Wright consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against her from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Wright.  On March 9, 2016, the Honorable Judge Robert M. O'Connor issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order, ordering Wright to return to her home state of Georgia, and ordering her to sign a consent judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the federal securities laws, imposing a conduct-based injunction, and appointing a receiver to oversee the allocation of the district.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John R. Alford and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the SEC Investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a separate case, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action on March 8, 2016.  This case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Atlanta Division of Criminal Investigations."
