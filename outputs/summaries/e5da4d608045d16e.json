  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Scania AB, a Swedish company, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, NRE Power Systems, Inc., for violating the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's order, filed on May 6, 2019, Scania and NRE violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Scania violated the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and that NRE has failed to show that it has reasonable jurisdiction over a company that manufactures or sells a product that causes injury to a third party.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Scani has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Scani.  On May 9, 2019 the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of California entered a temporary restraining order, freezing Scania's assets, and ordering NRE to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.5 million, $1 million, and $100,000, respectively, to be determined by the court at a later date.  A hearing scheduled for June 24, 2019 will be conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 21, 2019)."
