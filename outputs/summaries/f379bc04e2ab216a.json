  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Michigan yesterday entered a final judgment against Florida-based ABG Prime Group, Inc., a Michigan-based company, and its local counsel, Bryan Acrich, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Michigan, alleges that ABG and Acrich violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  ABG's complaint also alleges that Acrich and his company, All Alliance Products, Inc. (All Alliance), drafted fraudulent IP complaints targeting an online store run by a Michigan company.  According to the complaint, ABG failed to show that it had any basis to raise a jurisdictional defense and instead filed a one-sentence, one-paragraph general appearance.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Florida defendants' appearance did not give rise to a reasonable expectation that they would defend the merits of the complaint.  For example, as ABG alleges in its amended complaint, the Florida Defendants' appearance was nothing more than a lawyer choosing one way to comply with the federal law.  As ABG further alleges, neither Total Image nor Prodromitis have ever sold anything in Michigan, and neither of them have ever owned any real estate.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $50,000 each.  Additionally, the court has issued an order suspending Acrich from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, barring him from appearing and practicing before it, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against Acrich. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Commerce, and the Michigan Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
