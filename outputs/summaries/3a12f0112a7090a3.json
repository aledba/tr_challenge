  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of a second-degree felony for his role in the April 1, 2010, shooting death of Washington Park Mayor John Thornton.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that defendant Nortisha Ball, who was then serving a four-year sentence for residential burglary and theft, provided false testimony to the court in a parallel criminal case.  According to the complaint, Ball told the court that she and her sister, Angela Dodd, saw Thornton get out of the car and run into a tree, and that she saw the defendant get out and jump in the car.  As alleged, however, neither of these statements were true.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the defendant used a combination of verbal and written statements to convince the court to impose a temporary restraining order preventing the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Ball consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Ball.  On May 28, 2015, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against the defendant and ordered him to appear before the court again on June 1, 2016, to answer a question about whether or not he should be sentenced to 35 years in prison and ordered to pay $2,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a $100,000 civil penalty.  A hearing scheduled for June 2, 2016 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. Eastern time to consider the merits of the defendant's motion.   The court granted the request for a temporary injunction, ordered the defendant to comply with the court's order, and appointed a new attorney to represent him in the matter.
