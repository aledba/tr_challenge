  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New York City landlord for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the landlord and ordered him to pay $150,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, on July 31, 2009, the landlord filed an application to eliminate elevator service in an apartment building owned by Jamie Lawenda. The court found that the landlord had not yet established that the elevator was inoperable and could not be repaired without the landlord's written approval. In addition, the court also found that Lawenda had not demonstrated a financial hardship that would have made repairs impossible at the time the landlord requested it to remove the elevator.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Department of Buildings today announced criminal charges against Lawenda for his role in the alleged scheme. The SEC's complaint charges the landlord with violating Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 and Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgements of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The case is being handled by John Rymas of the SEC's New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica and Ms. Pyszka.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in this matter."
