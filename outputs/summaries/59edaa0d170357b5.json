  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 21, 2018 entered a final judgment against RAKIA, a company controlled by Azima, that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that, from at least October 2015 through August 2016, Azima engaged in a series of unauthorized computer hacks that targeted his personal and business computers.  According to the complaint, the hackers accessed Azima's computer while he was negotiating with his former CEO, and then used the stolen data to create the impression that Azima was acting as a mediator between the two sides.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the hacking occurred during the final stretch of the negotiations, when Azima sought to capitalize on the potential effect of the alleged hacking on his personal computer.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the hackers published Azima-related emails on a number of BitTorrent websites, presumably to punish Azima for his role in the failed mediation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission of Inquiry, the Commission has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining Azima from future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering him to comply with the Commission's order.  On February 22, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court entered a judgment ordering the Commission to consider whether or not to issue an order imposing a temporary restraining order, ordering Azima to return all of his computer equipment, and imposing a civil penalty of $4,162,500.  Sansone also agreed to be enjoined from associating with any third party in connection with a foreign criminal case.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, with the assistance of the Office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The Commission has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of foreign-based securities fraud.  Investors can\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2"
