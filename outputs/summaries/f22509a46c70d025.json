  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against defendant Andre Pearre Walker, Jr., who was convicted of three counts of aggravated sodomy (OCGA \u00a7 16-6-2) (a) and two counts of false imprisonment (OCA \u00a7 16:6-3) (b) and one count of impersonating an officer.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Atlanta, from December 2012 through January 2013, Walker told three different men that he was an undercover police officer and that he would like to have sex with them in the car he was driving based upon the promise of payment that he never made and never intended on making.  The complaint alleges that Walker failed to explore whether the three men were in fact prostitutes who consented to their sexual encounters with him.  Walker also alleges that he failed to consider the fact that one of the men was a police officer who had never before engaged in anal intercourse with Walker.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Atlanta today announced criminal charges against Walker, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Walker has consented, without admitting, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $25,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Atlanta Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Division of Criminal Investigations, and is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Atlanta Police Department, and the Atlanta Field Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related case, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Walker on January 24, 2013, alleging that he violated the antigay provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(e)"
