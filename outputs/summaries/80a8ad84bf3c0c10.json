  "summary": "On May 17, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Wilson Morocho, who was convicted of three counts of aggravated stalking.  According to the court's order, on August 25, 2014, a Chicago woman received a series of threatening text messages from defendant, the father of her son.  The court found that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he was liable for a civil penalty of four years and a $15,000 officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Morcho.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, in violation of Section 12-7.3 of the Exchange Act, that defendant violated Sections 5(a)(2) and 5(c)(3) and of the Stalking Statute.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Morchos consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $5,000, and imposes a $10,000 civil penalty, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, which is subject to court approval.  On May 18, 2020, the court entered a judgment ordering a permanent injunction against further violations of the anti-stalking provisions, ordering a preliminary injunction, and ordering a hearing on the matter to be conducted by the court at a later date.  A hearing is scheduled for May 24, 2020. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Department of Justice in this matter."
