  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Derrick Kevin Metcalf, Jr., a Texas resident charged with capital murder for his role in the death of Rose Hunt.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Harris County, Texas, alleges that, from February 24, 2017 through February 24th, 2017, MetCalf was charged with attempted capital murder by David Galindo, a convicted felon who had been convicted of capital murder in the past.  According to the complaint, Metrocalf agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Metrocff, who was also charged as a principal to capital murder.  On March 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting to the charges in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, Metacff consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Metrocaff to pay a civil monetary penalty of $1,500.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with a capital murder investigation.  Metrocoff agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Aug. 22, 2017).  The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice."
