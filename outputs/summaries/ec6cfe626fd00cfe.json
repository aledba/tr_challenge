  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against a former state prisoner for failing to disclose income that he received as a result of his release from prison.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Shauntae Robertson, who was incarcerated at the Pontiac Correctional Center in Pontiac, Illinois, failed to disclose in his IFP application that he had received $4,000 in settlement payments from prison guards who allegedly had violated his constitutional rights.  According to the complaint, Robertson was isolated in a filthy cell, which was covered with urine and human feces and infested with insects and mice.  Robertson allegedly attempted suicide after six days of confinement, attempted suicide, and attempted to commit suicide.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California today found that Robertson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Robertson consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $14,714. The judgment also requires the prison to forward 20% of the income credited to the prisoner's trust account to the court until the full amount of the filing fee has been paid.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release No. 5, No. 13, and No. 17-cv-01-20.  This case is being handled by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois Department of Corrections."
