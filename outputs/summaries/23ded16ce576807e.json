  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil injunctive action brought by two religious organizations, American Friends of Lubavitch (AFL) and Jewish World Peace (JWIP). The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that, contrary to the defendants' representations to the court, the defendants failed to comply with the requirements of the federal securities laws.  The court's final judgment, which permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the federal anti-fraud provisions, orders the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued a preliminary injunction against the defendants.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the Eastern District of Washington, defendants agreed to settle the case by agreeing to the entry of a permanent injunction. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Grace McLane Geisel, James V. Hurson Assocs., and Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Geisel and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 598 (D.C. 2016)."
