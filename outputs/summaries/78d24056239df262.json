  "summary": "On January 25, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a final judgment against a traveling Christian evangelist who claimed he was called to share his religious beliefs on a public college campus.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, on March 10, 2016, Rodney Keister and a friend went to the University of Alabama (UA) to share their religious beliefs.  The complaint alleges that Keister was approached by two university officers and a UA official who advised them that the intersection and sidewalk were \"traditional public fora\" and that the university's grounds use policy required 10 working days advance notice and university organization sponsorship.  Keister agreed to the court's order and agreed to be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Keister consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Keister.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Justice's Office of Public Education. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Keister\u00c2\u00a0and supervised by Jan Folena."
