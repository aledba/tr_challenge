  "summary": "On March 27, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against Las Vegas-based defendants Las Vegas Sands, LLC, MGM Resorts International Inc., d/b/a/Caesars Entertainment Corporation, and Harrah's Tahoe Management Company, Inc. for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order halting the defendants from further violations of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Texas, defendants lured a high-stakes Las Vegas gambler into gambling by promising him millions of dollars of \"customer retention\" rebates, free first-class travel, luxury accommodations, vacations, and food and beverage, and by extending large lines of credit for him to use in the process.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants were aware of the amount of money [Decedent] had received in casino credit and were aware that his huge gambling losses were causing him to spiral into a never-ending spiral of debt.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Defendants continued to extend additional credit to Decedent, pushing him further into the brink of bankruptcy.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States. The final judgments also order the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amounts of their profits.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Rule 12(b)(2) and ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million, which would be the same as the penalty imposed by the court on the defendants in the wake of Daimler.  On March 26, 2018 the U\u0080\u0099s Office of International Affairs issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of investing in a Las Vegas casino.
