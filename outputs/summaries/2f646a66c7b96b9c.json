  "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing administrative proceeding against two pharmaceutical companies accused of defrauding patients.  The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleges that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, defendants failed to adequately disclose to investors that they had overpaid for eye drops, and failed to disclose that the price of the eye drops was substantially higher than the recommended price for the drops.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants' dispensers did not disclose the size of the drops, nor did they disclose the number of drops dispensed.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $500,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, for each of these violations, and orders the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $250,000.  Additionally, the defendants have agreed to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-approved medical device, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any FDA-approved drug product.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 582 F.3d (Jan. 24, 2009).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant a company that manufactures, markets, and sells eye drops that are not substantially larger than 15 microliters, and that the company has agreed to pay to settle the case against them.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Amy S. Cotter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Massachusetts Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
