  "summary": "On January 12, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against a former Santa Cruz Police Department officer who filed an application for industrial disability retirement on the basis of psychiatric disability due to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Santa Cruz, California, Josafat Rodriguez, Jr., a former officer with the Santa Cruz County Narcotics Enforcement Team, agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains Rodriguez from performing the duties of a police station duty officer.  The court also ruled that Rodriguez was not substantially incapacitated from performing his duties as a police officer, and that Rodriguez's failure to disclose his PTSD was a consequence of the fact that he worked while allegedly disabled.  Rodriguez also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer for five years and ordered to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court also denied Rodriguez's request for a writ of mandamus, which is entitled to the \"deference and respect due a judicial decision.\"  The SEC's investigation was conducted by James Bryant and Carla Galloway, and was supervised by Mark A. Snyder, Jr. and Cheryl L. Wences of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Snyder and Ms. Galloway. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Office of Inspector General."
