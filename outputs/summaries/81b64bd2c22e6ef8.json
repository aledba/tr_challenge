  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against VMR Electronics Corporation, a New York-based electronic components manufacturer, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that VMR filed a complaint in October 2015 alleging that the IRS improperly used its own labor and materials to pay for VMR's tax obligations.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that the complaint was filed on the date the IRS received a tax levy from VMR, and that it was told that the amount of the levy was being offset by the amount owed to the company.  VMR had a different Tax Identification Number than Plaintiff, and the complaint further alleges that, in July 2017, the IRS seized $47,024.15 from the company, which was owed $67,154.05.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the collection and processing of the alleged tax liability.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, VMR has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $20,000 and a $50,000 civil penalty, and requires VMR to pay an officer and director bar and a penny stock bar.  Additionally, the court has ordered the IRS to provide a copy of the complaint to the court for further determination by the court upon motion by the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 26-1,  The Complaint also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(d) and (d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and a bar prohibiting VMR from participating in any future distributions of federal funds.  Finally, the SEC is seeking an order requiring the payment of civil penalties in the form of a civil injunctive relief, including an injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and other emergency relief.  A hearing on the matter has been scheduled for May 26, 2018."
