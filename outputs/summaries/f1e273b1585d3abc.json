  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maine today entered a final judgment against Timothy D. Curtis, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to seven years in prison for his role in a 2017 felony drug possession case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Maine, alleges that Curtis violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he violated the registration provisions of Sections 206(1)(A) and 206(2)(B) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint also alleges that, contrary to Curtis's claims, the complaint alleges that the girlfriend was not under the stress of excitement caused by the alleged drug possession and that she did not have the capacity to reflect on the startling events either while lying scared in bed next to Curtis after he had violently assaulted her, threatened to kill everyone in the house, and pointed a gun at her, or while waiting in the bedroom for a short period after Curtis left to make sure he was really gone.  According to the complaint, the girlfriend and her son, who were also present at the time of the alleged incident, did not dare leave the house because they did not want to be in a relationship with Curtis and were concerned about the younger son's safety after Curtis confronted them about the gun.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Curtis.  On January 10, 2018, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhansley granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Curtis and ordered him to return to the house and deposit the stolen gun in a safe. The court also granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 206(3)(A), and ordered Curtis to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Curtis consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,500,000 and a $100,000 civil penalty. The judgment also prohibits Curtis from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a federal agency, including the issuance of a court order requiring him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, and requires him to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company."
