  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of a drug-related felony and sentenced to a prison term of 235 months.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Jonair Moore, who was indicted in 2009 and charged with distributing and possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base, was not eligible for a sentence reduction under the mandatory sentencing provisions of the federal securities laws. Rather, Moore was found responsible for 11.1 kg of cocaine and 1.2 kg of crack cocaine base. The court found that Moore was responsible for the drug quantity attributable to him, and that he should be commended for his use of a firearm in furtherance of the drug trafficking conspiracy. The complaint further alleges that Moore had a history of violating the federal drug laws, including a felony conviction for possession of more than 50 grams of cocaine. Moore was also convicted pursuant to jury verdict for a dry conspiracy, based on the testimony of cooperating witnesses. In 2012, the court found Moore liable for a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. In 2013, the Court granted Moore's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered Moore to be barred from serving any prison term beyond the mandatory minimum. Moore agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval. The Court's order also prohibits Moore from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Moore to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his sentence. Moore has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $1,000,000. Moore also agreed to be restrained from associating with any third party in a criminal case. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Moore. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
