  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against SUMSS Property Management, LLC (\"SUMSS\"), an Ohio-based real estate and property management company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that SUMSS entered into a settlement agreement on December 6, 2017, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  According to the complaint, the settlement agreement required SUMSS to transfer seventeen properties to Marsha and Lisa, and required that the parties enter into an enforceable settlement agreement.  SUMSS's complaint, filed in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that, prior to the settlement, Marsha's attorney sent \"inappropriate texts\" to Lisa's attorney, threatening her with criminal prosecution for her support of SUMSS during the litigation.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 16, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the assets of the defendants and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.   The court's order freezes the defendants' assets and prohibits SUMSS from issuing or selling any security deposit or other security deposit in the names of the parties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael R. Kostelnik and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Department of Insurance, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
