  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Larry Lewis, Jr., a 41-year-old first-time offender who was convicted of four counts of molestation of a juvenile.  The court found that Lewis violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its order, the court also entered a temporary restraining order against Lewis, who was also convicted of two counts of child molestation.  According to the court's order, Lewis was placed in a position of trust and authority over the victim by a visually impaired mother and he used that position to prey upon the young victim who was under his supervision and control.  As alleged in the complaint, Lewis violated and betrayed the mother's faith and trust and exploited the weak and vulnerable for his own personal gratification.  On May 15, 2018, the trial court issued an order suspending Lewis from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of 20 years at a time, and imposing a $10,000 civil penalty.  Lewis agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, charges Lewis with violating Section 14(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act and Section 15(b)(2) and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Lewis and his family.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 14:81.2:  The complaint also names Lewis's mother as a defendant in the case.  A hearing is scheduled for May 17, 2018 to consider the merits of the case and determine whether to impose a permanent injunction against Lewis from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, as well as the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  In a parallel action, the SEC today announced that it has obtained an asset freeze against Lewis in connection with its investigation of the same matter, which was conducted in the Office of the United States District Judge in the Eastern District of Louisiana. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter, the Louisiana Attorney General's Office, and the Louisiana Department of Health and Human Services."
