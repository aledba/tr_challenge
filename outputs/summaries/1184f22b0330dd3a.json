  "summary": "On March 20, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia entered a final judgment against Latoya Denise Jefferson, a former employee of the Pittsylvania County Department of Social Services, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Richmond, Virginia, Jefferson received a renewal application for SNAP benefits in February 2015. The application required her to report excess SNAP benefits for all members of her household. The complaint alleges that Jefferson received overpayments in SNAP benefits of $1,882 during the period covered by the first indictment, and $3,517 during the second indictment.  The complaint further alleges that the overpayment calculation was based on the false information provided by the Department, and that Jefferson had not reported her income when she submitted the application.  As alleged in the complaint, Jefferson was not entitled to a 20% earned income deduction from undisclosed income, and therefore should not have received any benefits at all.  In a parallel action, the Court of Appeals of Virginia today issued an order suspending Jefferson from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Dawn Hankins, a fraud investigator for the SEC, and was supervised by Gregory A. Kasper. The litigation will be led by Ms. Hankins. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia Department of Health and Human Services, and the Pennsylvania Department of Justice."
