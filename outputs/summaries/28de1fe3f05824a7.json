  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Lance Bess, a former Utah State Police officer, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 76-10-506 of the Utah Rules of Evidence.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that, in 1895, the Utah state court issued an order suspending Bess from participating in jury selection for a new trial.  According to the complaint, Bess and his family were hunting at public shooting grounds when an inexperienced hunter shot in their direction.  Bess alleges that the jury deliberated for approximately three hours before notifying the court that they were deadlocked five votes to one in a fight or quarrel.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the jury selection order suspended Bess for three days, and he was ordered to submit a reply memorandum by 5:00 p.m. on August 11, 2017.  In its judgment, the court found that Bess violated Section 6(b) of the federal securities laws, and that he violated Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2)(A) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s findings, the judge granted Bess a temporary restraining order and ordered Bess to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $1,000 civil penalty.  On August 13, BESS pleaded guilty to one count of premeditated murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  He was also sentenced to five years of supervised release and ordered to pay $2,500 in restitution.  To learn more about jury selection, see Salt Lake Tribune v. Bess (2014).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Utah today announced criminal charges against Bess.  This case was investigated by the Salt Lake Regional Office and the Utah Division of Criminal Investigation, which conducted a parallel examination of the issues raised in the complaint. The case was supervised by Scott A. Thompson, Chief of the Office of Public Safety. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Utah State Attorney General, and Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office encourages the public to check the backgrounds of people who commit a crime by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Litigation Release\u00c2\u00a0to identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In this matter, the SEC encourages the use of\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investigative litigation release\u00c2\u00a0on the basis of evidence presented to the court."
