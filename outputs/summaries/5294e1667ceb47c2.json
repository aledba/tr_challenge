  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a Wheeling, Illinois-based company and its former chief executive officer for defrauding investors out of millions of dollars.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, from 1994 to 2015, Pro Sapiens, LLC (Pro Sapiens) and its CEO, Emmanuel Jacob, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Jacob was not a party to the case and, instead, he was the sole owner of the company.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Jacob signed a cease-and-desist letter in which he agreed to pay $205,489 in attorney fees and $39,544.76 in expert fees.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Jacob consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $30,085.  Jacob also agreed to be barred from appearing before the court as a result of the Commission's finding that he had committed egregious discovery violations, including deleting e-mails and documents from his personal Yahoo e-mail account.  On August 17, 2016, the court granted Jacob's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered him to appear for a hearing on the merits of the case.  As set forth in the order, however, that the court had no jurisdiction over Jacob at the time it issued the preliminary injunction, and did not impose any monetary sanctions against Jacob.  Instead, it imposed a $20,000 civil penalty against Jacob and a $10,000 penalty against Pro Sapien.   The court's order also prohibits Jacob from appearing as an attorney or representing himself in a civil proceeding, and prohibits him from participating in the issuance or filing of any written response to a Commission Order or Order of a Complaint against a defendant.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5/2-301 (March 2014).  The Commission's order against Jacob was issued on July 1, 2018, and the court found that Jacob violated the due process provisions of Rule 303(a)(1) and issued a temporary restraining order against him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as part of a litigated proceeding.  It also ordered Jacob to comply with the Commission Order and to submit a written response by September 16, 2018.  Finally, the Commission issued a cease and desist order on August 22, 2016."
