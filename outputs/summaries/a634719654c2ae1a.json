  "summary": "On June 6, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against Matthew J. Hight, a Virginia resident who seeks to pilot ships on Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Hight from future violations of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida, Hight was denied a pilotage license by the United States Coast Guard in July 2018.  In a parallel action, the court issued an order freezing Hight's assets, freezing his assets, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Hight consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1404(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the Court also ordered Hight to pay disgorgement of $5,000, prejudgment interest of $2,500, and a $1,500 civil penalty.  As set forth in the order, this action is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, or No. 17, 2019.
