  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Michael P. Knab, who was convicted on two counts of making a false report to a law enforcement agency and improper use of a 9-1-1 system.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 4, 2018, Knab told a Centerville Police Department dispatcher that there was an active shooter and injured person at his residence.  Knab also allegedly told the dispatcher that he had been hallucinating and had been smoking methamphetamine and was seeing people with guns.  The complaint alleges that Knab's mother and friend, Yvonne Knab and David Carter, told Knab that no one in the house had a gun and that there were no shooting victims.  As alleged in the complaint, the complaint further alleges that the officers' time spent responding to the call cost the officers $1,375.56 in hourly wages, and Knab had a history of drug use.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's judgment, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Knab to pay a $500 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Knab arising from the same conduct.  On May 24, 2018 the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan announced criminal criminal charges. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
