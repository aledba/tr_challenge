  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of defendants in a case brought by a Boy Scout who was sexually abused by a member of the organization.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 340.1 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, the defendants failed to file a certificate of merit with respect to the allegations in the second amended complaint, which was filed in the District of Columbia on May 3, 1988.  In its judgment, the court held that defendants were entitled to attorney fees pursuant to subdivision (q) of this federal law, and that defendants could be awarded attorney fees only if there was a favorable conclusion to the litigation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay any reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, incurred by the defendant for whom the complaint was filed.  As a result, defendants were not eligible to receive attorney fees under the federal law.  On May 4, 2018, a federal district court in San Diego, California, entered a judgment against the defendants, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $20,000.  Additionally, the district court issued an order suspending the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the certificates of merit, which are subject to court approval.    The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Southern California, charges the defendants with violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 1718 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly illusory gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  It also seeks a preliminary injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and an officer and director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Los Angeles Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter."
