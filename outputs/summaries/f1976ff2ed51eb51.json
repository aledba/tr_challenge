  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Memphis, Tennessee-area doctor who was found liable for his or her role in a recent medical negligence action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Memphis, alleges that, in 2002, Christy Bradley had a blood clot in her abdomen that required surgery.  According to the complaint, Dr. B.J. Stovall, the on-call physician who performed the hysterectomy on Ms. Bradley, failed to adequately evaluate the patient's medical history, her condition, and her ability to perform the minimally invasive procedure.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the trial court did not properly consider the evidence presented to the jury.  As alleged in the SEC's order, the jury was not adequately instructed on how to determine whether Dr. Bishop violated the standard of care.  Instead, the court allowed the expert to discuss the risks of the surgery with the jury, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  Finally, the SEC found that, based on the testimony of the trial judge, that the defendant did not adequately consider the risks posed by the injury to the patient, and that the jury could not determine whether to grant a new trial on the merits of the case.  On the other hand, the Court also found that the expert who provided the evidence was not liable for the jury's determination of whether the patient had suffered a serious medical injury.    In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Tennessee today announced criminal charges against Bradley. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigation Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint Bulletin\u00c2\u00a0on the subject of this matter.  This Bulletin has also issued an Investor Alert alerting investors to the dangers of investing in a risky investment in a company that does not have a proven track record of success.  Investor Alert: Investors should be aware of the risks associated with investing in risky investments in companies that do not have proven track records of success or failure."
