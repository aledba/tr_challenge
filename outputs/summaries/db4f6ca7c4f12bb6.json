  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment in favor of a North Carolina-based third party in a custody case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Serena Sebring Wadlington and Joseph Fitzgerald Wadlington violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Sebring and Wadlington were the biological parents of B.J.W., born 10 February 2000, and C.A.W. born 5 January 2003, and the children were conceived and born during defendants\u2019 marriage. The complaint alleges that, while defendants were engaged in a long-term, committed and exclusive relationship, plaintiff and mother did not have standing to seek custody of the children. Rather, plaintiff claimed that she was centrally involved in the care, upbringing and development of the two children, and that mother had acted inconsistently with her protected status as a parent by relinquishing her right to exclusive care and control over the children during her relationship with mother. The SEC further alleges that the defendants did not seek a divorce from father and did not pursue a legal marriage with plaintiff after same-sex marriage was recognized in North Carolina.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of South Carolina today announced criminal charges against Sebring. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement. The litigation will be led by Emily Susanna Ch\u00e1vez and supervised by Lara S. Mehraban."
