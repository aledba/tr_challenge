  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of South Dakota yesterday entered a temporary restraining order against two Indian tribes and a state attorney general in an ongoing civil enforcement action.  The SEC's complaint alleges that the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe violated the Due Process Clause of the federal securities laws by denying Indian parents the right to a meaningful post-deprivation hearing hearing after their children were removed from their homes.  According to the complaint, the defendants also violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint also alleges that South Dakota law provides for a right to counsel, an opportunity to present evidence on their behalf, and an opportunity for a hearing at a meaningful time following the removal of an Indian child from state custody.  In its order, the court found that the defendants violated the due process provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and Rule 17a-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, South Dakota and the state governments have agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty, and requires them to comply with the court's order. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson, Ms. Pappan, and Ms. Young. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Illinois, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
