  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered final judgments against Allen Eugene Gregory, a convicted felon, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., alleges that Gregory violated Section 14 of the federal securities laws by failing to timely raise the issue of the death penalty.  According to the complaint, Gregory was investigated for a separate rape crime based on allegations by R.S., who was also charged and convicted of first degree murder.  Gregory was sentenced to death in a parallel criminal case in which Gregory was convicted of the same crime.  As alleged, Gregory's conviction was based on a statistical analysis that he used to determine whether a defendant had a history as a paid confidential informant.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Gregory consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 14 and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his sentence.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Gregory arising from the same conduct that led Gregory to his conviction.  Among other things, Gregory has agreed to settle the charges against him by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the appointment of a new trial judge.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance of any SEC order or order appointing a receiver.  This settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, with litigation assistance from John Rymas.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of the United States District Judge in the District of Columbia, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson under the supervision of C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Seattle Police Department, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHSA)."
