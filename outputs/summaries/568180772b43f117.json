  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Maine today entered a final judgment against the Town of Scarborough for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the Town to comply with the court's order.  In its order, the court also ordered the town to provide the Taxpayers with an accounting of the difference between the amount a taxpayer actually paid and what he or she \u201cshould have paid had a municipality followed lawful assessment practices,\u201d and to provide them with a 31.48 percent discount to their land values.  According to the Court's order, however, the amount of abatements that the Town granted to the taxpayers was not sufficient to offset the inequities in the tax treatment.  As a result of the Board's decision, the Town and the Town agreed to expand the scope of the proceedings to allow the Board to determine the appropriate abatement amounts for the four tax years in question.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the town and the town consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay $380,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the Court granted the Town's request for an injunction, which is subject to court approval, to the issuance of an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an injunction against future violations.   The Court also issued an order suspending the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any penny stock that may be deemed appropriate for the purpose of recovering the value of the penny stock at a later date.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge William J. Donnelly of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia entered a judgment permanently enjoining the Town from violating the above-mentioned provisions of federal law.  Donnelly also agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  To learn more about equal protection under federal law, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-20, July 13, 2014. \u00c2\u00a0The Court also ruled that the District Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York and the Secretary of State's Office had sufficient discretion to determine how to proceed with this matter.  Among other things, Donnelly agreed to the appointment of a receiver and to the payment of a $100 million civil penalty."
