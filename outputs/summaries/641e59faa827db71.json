  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Novartis) for negligent failure to warn about potential fetal harm caused by a brand-name drug.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles on September 5, 2014, alleges that, from at least 2001 through 2007, the company failed to adequately warn pregnant women about the potential risks of tocolytic use.  According to the complaint, as a result of the company's failure to inform them of the risks, they were injured.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the company did not adequately inform their mother of the potential side effects of terbutaline, which is a beta-agonist or beta-mimetic drug designed to act upon the beta-2 receptors located in smooth muscle tissue to cause muscles to relax.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in the amount of $10,000.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in the District of Columbia, charging the company with liability under Section 5 of the Exchange Act for the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On September 6, 2019, the court entered a judgment ordering the company to pay a civil penalty of $15,000, ordering it to disgorge $1,500, and imposing a $20,000 civil penalty.  Following the court's order, on September 13, 2020, the Court entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $25,000 each. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter."
