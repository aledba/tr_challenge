  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Hawai'i today entered final judgments against a Hawaii-based company and its owner in a tax case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Hawaii, alleges that the Hawai\u2018i Department of Revenue (DOI) and Hawaii Department of Insurance (MDI) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 237-18(f) of the federal tax laws. The complaint alleges that, in violation of these provisions, the DOI has barred the OTC and MDI from collecting additional taxes related to tourism related services, including airline flights and car and hotel rentals. In addition, the complaint alleged that the Department of Health and Human Services (DOH) has not recognized the importance of \"transportation related services\" in the tax laws, and that the DoH has failed to recognize the need for additional taxes to be collected on behalf of the state.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the complaint, the court issued a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the assets of the companies and imposing a civil penalty of $1.5 million. The court's order freezes the assets and proceeds of the defendants' alleged tax fraud, and orders the return of any ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest to be determined by the court at a later date.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the above-mentioned federal statutes, and requires them to pay disgorgement of $2,078.95 plus interest and penalties of $3,079.95. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 24, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Hawaii Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of the Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
