  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Kerlyn T., a defendant who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that on May 26, 2013, the defendant broke into the victim's Danbury apartment armed with a semiautomatic assault style rifle and demanded that the court provide him with more time to consider whether to elect a jury trial or a court trial.  According to the complaint, the court denied the defendant's request for a second competency evaluation, which was conducted on May 28, 2014, by the Office of Forensic Evaluations, which determined that the defendant had a history of mental illness and was unable to assist with his own defense.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the trial court failed to inquire as to the reasons why the defendant was not competent to proceed to trial, whether he had sufficient time to discuss the matter with his counsel, or whether he was satisfied with his response to the court's inquiry.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requires them to provide a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the judgment orders the defendant to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years.  On August 2, 2016, the Honorable Joseph R. Rizzo of the U. S. District court for the Eastern District of Connecticut granted the defendant a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return to the United States to be a free and simple citizen.  A hearing for the motion followed by a hearing on August 4, 2016 where the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of criminal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and was sentenced to prison terms of 10 years and 10 months.  After the sentencing, the jury deliberated for approximately three hours before finding the defendant competent to stand trial and to consent to the appointment of a new trial judge.  As part of its investigation, the SEC obtained an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver and ordering the receiver to provide the receiver with the receiver's telephone number and other information about the receiver.  Finally, the receiver agreed to be restrained and held at gunpoint until the court concluded its investigation"
