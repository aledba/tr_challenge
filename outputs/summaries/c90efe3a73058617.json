  "summary": "On March 28, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against the defendants, finding that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants' assets, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on August 10, 2011, Emma Nation began renting an apartment from Humboldt Bay Housing Development Corporation (HBHDC), which is a private corporation that receives funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  The complaint alleges that in 2016 and in 2011, Plaintiff was removed, along with her daughter, from her apartment because she had not attempted to pursue administrative remedies and would not plead exhaustion if given leave to amend.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia today announced criminal charges against Nation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, order them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains, and impose civil penalties of up to $1,000,000. The settlements are subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kelly L. Gibson, Patrick J. McCluskey, and Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Nation and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, and the California Department of Health and Human Services."
