  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Airbnb, United Technologies Corporation, and Kidde Portable Equipment, Inc. (KPMG) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that the Lewises, through Airbnb, marketed and sold ionization-triggered smoke detectors in Illinois to Illinois residents.  According to the complaint, in September 2016, theLewises and their then-boyfriend, Baldomero Zamora, purchased and operated a house in Illinois called \"Kidde's House,\" which allegedly failed to timely activate and caused Zamora's death.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in November 2017, after learning that Zamora was going to be traveling to Maine to have a surprise birthday party for his boyfriend, he contacted his mother, telling her that he would like to stay at her house.   The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Zamora.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 4, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
