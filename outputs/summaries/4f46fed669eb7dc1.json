  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against a Kansas City, Kansas man who was convicted of a felony for digitally raping and sodomizing a 12-year-old girl.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Wilson, who is awaiting sentencing.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Kansas City on May 5, 2016, Wilson was arrested and sentenced to a total of 32 months in prison. The SEC alleges that Wilson, then 18 years old, had just turned 18, and lacked the ability to make a \"good decision\" in having sex with the victim. The complaint further alleges that the prosecutor misstated to the court the facts of the case and those in an unpublished court decision cited as authority for Wilson's misconduct. The court agreed that Wilson was liable to a fair trial because he had committed a serious felony.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Wilson.  On May 6, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction against Wilson from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and an officer-and-director bar prohibiting Wilson from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the sale or issuance of a security deposit.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Wilson consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his prison sentence. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see SEC v. Wilson, No. 114567, 2016 WL 7324427, at *8. The Court granted Wilson's request for a temporary injunction against future violations, and ordered him to comply with the court's order. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Kansas Division of Criminal Investigation.  A hearing for Wilson was scheduled for June 5, 2017.  To learn more about the SEC, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 535, 550, 264 P.3d 461 (2011).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Mascianica and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Werner."
