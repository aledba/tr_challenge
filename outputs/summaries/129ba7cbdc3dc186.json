  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a temporary restraining order against a Florida man accused of defrauding his co-defendant out of millions of dollars.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that Michael J. Gosciminski, a former sheriff's deputy, made a false statement to a jury about the presence of DNA on the alleged victim's buttocks. The complaint further alleges that the defendant told the jury that he was going to come back and check on her, and that he had a \"DNA match\" on his butt. The SEC alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, the defendant replied, \"You see the DNA on my butt? It was enough.\" The complaint alleges, however, that the jury could not determine whether the defendant had a DNA match because the evidence presented to the jury was inconclusive. In addition, the complaint alleges that when the jury questioned the defendant about the evidence, he replied, \u201cI'm not sure that I'm going to tell you that. I'm just trying to minimize the situation.\u201d The complaint also alleges that during the course of his cross-examination, he described the defendant's DNA on her butt as \"inconclusive,\" and that, in response to one of defense counsel's questions not related to DNA, he ended her answer by saying, \"I know you guys said that there was a possible DNA match.\" The court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The defendant agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central Florida Division of Criminal Justice announced criminal charges against the defendant. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Criminal Division of the Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by David A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. McKinley."
