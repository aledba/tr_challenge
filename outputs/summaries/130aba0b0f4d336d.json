  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Mexican fingerprint technician who was arrested and charged with illegally reentering the United States after having been removed from the country.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Tecate, California, alleges that, in September 2016, Mexican national Mario Ruvalcaba-Garcia was arrested by Border Patrol agents and charged in connection with his illegal reentry.  According to the complaint, the government presented to the court documents that purported to show that Beers was a member of IAI or SWGFAST and that, although he followed the ACE-V method of fingerprint analysis, he did not have another fingerprint analyst independently verify his conclusions.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the government misrepresented to the jury that the fingerprint on the 2015 Verification of Removal form was the same one that had been removed in 2015.

The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-director and penny stock bars against all defendants, as well as a conduct-based injunction against future violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-1 thereunder and Section 10b(b).
