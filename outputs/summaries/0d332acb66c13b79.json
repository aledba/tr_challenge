  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a former employee of the Department of Social Services for her use of a racial epithet during a private conversation with a supervisor.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Samantha Hurd, the former supervisor of the Child Protective Services Unit, made a false and misleading statement to a supervisor about the use of the \"n----- rican\" in a long string of racial epithets.  According to the complaint, Hurd told the supervisor that she believed Petitioner had used the term in referring to another African-American family member in the unit.  Hurd allegedly replied, \"Nigra rican.\"  The complaint further alleges that Petitioner immediately apologized to Hurd for her role in the alleged misconduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Petitioner consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for North Carolina announced criminal charges against Hurd.  On November 3, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Petitioner, charging her with violating Section 15(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 12b-20, and seeking a permanent injunction against her from violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The SEC also charged Hurd with aiding and abetting Petitioner's violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(c) of\u00c2\u00a0The Exchange Act and Rule\u00c2\u00a0206(4)-7 thereunder and for her participation in a scheme to manipulate the exchange of information between Hurd and Petitioner during the course of the Exchange Act. The complaint also alleges that Hurd violated Section 15a-20 and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder by failing to adequately account for the fact that she had overheard Hurd's exchange with Petitioner.  Finally, the complaint charges Petitioner with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 15(e) and 15e-9 of the Administrative Rules of the Court, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against her.
