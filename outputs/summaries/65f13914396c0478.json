  "summary": "On February 13, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Texas entered a preliminary injunction against Courson Oil & Gas, Inc., a Texas oil and gas company, from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 157 of the Texas Oil and Gas Act of 1940.  The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and entered a final judgment ordering the company to comply with the court's order.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action on March 2, 2020.  According to the complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, Texas, Courson and Barbara Lips built a ranchland empire across the Panhandle of Texas that spanned nearly half the size of Rhode Island. The complaint alleges that the ranch was at the height of its growth when, in 1994, Alpar Resources, Inc. inked a hydrocarbon exploration and production agreement with Lips, which required her to relinquish ownership of the leases.  As alleged, the ranch's leases were so large that it was losing tens of thousands of dollars a month.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the company consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the company from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Fort Worth Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Blake A. Watson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
