  "summary": "On October 16, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the parties' motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing their assets, and ordering the parties to pay a $20,931,500 civil penalty.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in New York City, the parties agreed to pay $350,000 to a full-time nanny to cover expenses related to the purchase of a luxury condominium apartment.  The court also agreed that the amount of the $400,000 payment to her father would be distributed among the parties, if at all, to meet their respective, uneven, contributions, both economic and noneconomic, that made it possible for them to acquire the property.  In addition, the court agreed that defendant's share of the funds would be allocated to each party, not to the other.  As a result of the settlement, defendant is not entitled to a separate property credit for the purpose of paying his portion of the property credit, and the parties will not be able to determine how to allocate the additional funds.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $2,819,430 plus prejudgment interest of $932,000, and to pay civil penalties of 10.5% and 30% of the total amount, respectively, for each party's respective contributions to the marriage and for the purposes of determining the equitable distribution of the additional property credit.  On the same day the court issued its order, it issued an order suspending the asset freeze, freezing the assets of both parties, and imposing a civil penalty of 10%.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Dolan and supervised by Marc Blau of the SEC's New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Deborah A. Kaplan. The case is being supervised by Gregory A. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
