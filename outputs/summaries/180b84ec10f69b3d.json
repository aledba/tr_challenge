  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a Houston-based lawyer and his law firm for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, Texas, alleges that, in 2006, the trial court improperly excluded testimony from the Fleming Firm's echocardiogram program.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that the defendants did not adequately disclose to the jury that they were falsely promised free echiocardiograms by law firms that referred them to the firm, and instead deducted the cost of their individual tests from their respective settlements.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants violated their fiduciary duties by failing to comply with the SEC\u2019s requirements for defendants to show cause and effect in connection with their violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 3, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the Fleming firm, charging it with violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of Rule 206(3) and an order requiring the firm to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  An SEC hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 24, 2016.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018, No. 17-cv-01444 (Houston, Tex. App., July 13, 2011).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Houston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
