  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Nebraska today announced criminal charges against a Lincoln, Nebraska man for his role in an armed robbery and shooting that left one victim dead and another paralyzed.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on April 18, 2016, a Lincoln County District Court jury found that Markel D. Steele violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that Steele violated Section 29-2260(3) by failing to consider the fact that Steele was a 17-year-old at the time of the alleged crime and that Steele had been raised as a Christian by his family and community. Steele was later sentenced to 60 years to life imprisonment for second degree murder and to 40 years to 50 years for first degree assault. Steele has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 28-105 and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the Nebraska Department of Justice today announced that it has issued an order suspending Steele from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and appointing a receiver. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Nebraska Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Nebraska Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General also issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a real estate investment using the SEC's investor.gov website.\u00c2\u00a0On May 2, 2018, the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against Steele, freezing his assets, and imposing a $10 million civil penalty against him.  On May 4, 2018 the court granted a request for a preliminary injunction against Steele from further violations of the federal securities laws, ordered Steele to be barred from the securities industry, and ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.2 million.   The court's order also temporarily suspended Steele from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock at any time.  A hearing on May 5, 2018 was scheduled for 9:30 a.m."
