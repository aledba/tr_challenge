  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of North Dakota today entered a final judgment in favor of the Arnegards, who are seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fargo, North Dakota, alleges that the Township of Arnegard violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, the Township had no duty to disclose the March 2012 amendments to affected landowners, and failed to inform them of the one-year automatic expiration of a conditional use permit.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in addition to failing to adequately disclose the issues raised in the complaint, the township failed to adequately consider the potential harm to property owners.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 5, 2012).  The complaint charges the Township with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of Securities Act Section 15a-14, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants. The court also ordered the Township to pay a civil penalty of $1,500.  It also issued a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the Township from issuing or selling any building permits, and issued an order appointing a receiver to determine the amount of any civil injunctive relief to be instituted against the defendant.  On May 2, 2017, the court granted the Township's motion for summary judgment and ordered a hearing to determine whether to proceed with the administrative proceeding. The hearing was scheduled for May 24, 2017.  According to the SEC's order:  The Commission on Economic and Risk Analysis has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by John R. Basinger and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office, and was supervised by"
