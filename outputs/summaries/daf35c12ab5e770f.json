  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC, a Lake County, Florida company that was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to determine the amount of attorney's fees and costs owed to the company.  In its judgment, the court found that the company was entitled to $309,500 in compensation for the condemnation, $15,013 for the permanent and temporary easements, and $282,777 for severance damages.  According to the court's order, the company had not previously agreed to sell its land for residential development and had not yet agreed to purchase any additional lots for the purpose of constructing the pipeline.  As alleged in the complaint, the district court improperly allowed Sunderman Groves to testify about the value of the parcel after the pipeline was built, and the court improperly granted the company's motion for a new trial.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Sabal trail and its attorney, Matthew Ray, agreed to settle the case by agreeing to pay $360,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The court also agreed to the payment of civil penalties, which will be determined by the court at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action against the company, alleging that it had violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(e) of The Securities Act. The SEC's complaint charges the company with violations of the broker-dealer registration provisions and seeks a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, and other emergency relief. The complaint also seeks a court order requiring the company to pay a $20,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 penalty. In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Alabama today announced criminal charges against the firm.
