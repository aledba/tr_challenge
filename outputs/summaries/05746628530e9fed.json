  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against two insurance companies for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that, under New York law, certain insurance companies are entitled to coverage under certain types of policies.  According to the complaint, these companies acquired pump manufacturing businesses from Houdaille Industries, Inc. in the 1980s that included coverage for long-tail and short-tail claims.  In addition, the complaint alleges that certain of the excess insurance policies included a provision that required the insurer to \"all sums\" to cover a loss that occurred during the policy period.  As alleged, this provision does not apply to all policies, and, in fact, it is inconsistent with the language of the policy.  For example, as set forth in the SEC's Complaint, in the case of Consolidated Edison, the non-cumulation and prior insurance provisions of the policies required that the insurer pay a certain amount of additional premium for each loss that occurs during a policy period, even if that loss occurred during a specific policy period during which the policy was in effect at the time.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's Judgment, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Finally, the court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, sale, or promotion of any insurance policy, including, without limitation, the right to reapply as an insurance agent in the event of an emergency.  On October 2, 2016, the Honorable Judge William J. Donnelly of the U. S. District court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granted the companies' request for a preliminary injunction, ordered them to comply with the court's order, and issued an order appointing an independent receiver to determine the appropriate allocation of excess insurance.  Donnelly and Donnelly agreed to the appointment of a receiver, which will determine whether to allocate excess insurance to specific policies and to the extent to which the insurer is liable for the same amount of loss or occurrence as the prior insurance policy. The court also granted the company's request for an officer and director bar against Donnelly, and ordered the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Christopher C. French and supervised by"
