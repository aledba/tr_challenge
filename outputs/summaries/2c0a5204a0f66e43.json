  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Physician's Surrogacy, Inc., a California-based company that claims to recover attorney's fees from computer data access and fraud.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 7, 2017, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against Defendants' violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also granted the motion for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against Defendants.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Defendants for their roles in the alleged scheme.  On March 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Defendants, charging them with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) and of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000 or $150,000, respectively, to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the SEC.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit and the Division of Enforcement's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Secretary of State's Office."
