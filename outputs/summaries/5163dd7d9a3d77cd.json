  "summary": "On March 13, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico entered a final judgment against the defendants in a parallel action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that they violated Section 9705 of the federal securities laws. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the defendants' claims, the defendants diverted $601 million of the $1.375 billion requested for border barrier construction. The SEC alleges that this diverted money should have been used for other purposes, such as to construct a border barrier. Instead, as alleged in the complaint, the Defendants diverted the money instead to pay for border wall construction, which is unrelated to the actual purpose of the funds diverted. In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to adequately consider the impact on the federal government of the diversion of funds. The court also found that the Defendants violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 9a-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating Section 5, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $1,500,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court also issued a temporary restraining order against the Defendants from further violations of Section 5 and Rule 5. The Court also issued an order requiring the defendants to provide a copy of the Commission's order, which was issued on February 18, 2019.  On March 19, 2019 the court granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction against further violations. The case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Office of Inspector General, with the assistance of Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice."
