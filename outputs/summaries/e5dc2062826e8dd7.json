  "summary": "On August 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico entered a final judgment against Gonz\u00e1lez-Gonz\u00e1lez, a former federal district court judge who was convicted of drug trafficking, conspiracy, and money laundering offenses.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order halting the defendant's recusal from the case.  According to the court's order, Gonzales filed a motion for recusal on January 21, 2009, alleging that Chief Judge Fust\u00e9 had a conflict of interest in the case, and that he had a duty not to recuse himself from the matter.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced that it filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, and appointing a temporary judge to handle the case as a result of the Court's order.  On August 24, 2010, the court issued an order appointing a judge to review the case and determine whether it was reasonable to consider recusal.  As alleged in the order, the judge \"recognized that [his] conflicts of interest [were] reasonable under the circumstances of this case and [had] a duty to act fast and loose with the judicial process so the Honorable Court of Appeals won't have the whole records to make a fair judgment for the rest of the court to consider.\"  The order also requires the judge to \"follow the course of a reasonable decision in the mind of a well-informed, reasonable person about the judge's capacity for impartiality.\"  In its order, which was entered on August 17, 2010 and unsealed on August 21, 2011, the Court issued an emergency court order halting Gonzaga's recuse from the pending litigation.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Ms. Gaunt and Ms. Gibson, and the case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Texas Department of Banking and Securities and Exchange Commission, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the New York Office of the Attorney General and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission."
