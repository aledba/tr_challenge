  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Georgia Gulf Lake Charles, LLC and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, jointly, severally and in solido, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, alleges that Georgia Gulf improperly awarded Mr. Adams supplemental earnings benefits (SEB) for his hearing loss.  According to the complaint, Adams began to notice some degree of hearing loss in his left ear in the mid-1980s but did not seek SEB until he was sixty-five years old.  He also allegedly had a habit of repeatedly removing his right earplug over the years to converse with his co-workers in the plant environment.

The SEC also charged Georgia Gulf with acting as an unregistered broker-dealer in connection with the alleged loss of hearing in Adams' right ear. Georgia Gulf has agreed to settle the case against it by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering it to pay civil penalties of $8,000 and $25,000, respectively, for each of those violations, and imposing an injunction against further violations of Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2)(A) and (c).  The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.
