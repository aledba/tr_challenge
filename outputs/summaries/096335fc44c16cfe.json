  "summary": "On April 17, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment ordering the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief of $82,500.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that, from 2013 through 2014, Edward St. John of Gering, Nebraska, retained Brenda L. Bartels and Monte L. Neilan, a Nebraska-licensed attorney based in Colorado, to represent him in a workers\u2019 compensation case. According to the complaint, the compensation court agreed to split the attorneys\u2019 fees evenly between the attorneys. The complaint further alleges that Bartels, Neilan and Zimmerman agreed to each receive $32,577.50 to satisfy their lien and to pay $75 per hour for the attorney\u2019s paralegal time from the date of discharge until the end of the case. In addition, the complaint alleges that the court did not analyze the fees owed to the attorneys under their written fee agreements with St.John. Rather, it focused solely on the respective value of the services provided by the attorneys and did not consider whether the attorneys were entitled to more than the amount of the attorney liens asserted in the complaint. The SEC also found that, in a parallel action, the Compensation Court improperly split the attorney fees evenly. The court found that neither Bartels nor Neilan are entitled to a reasonable amount of attorney fees, and that it should have relied on the fees of the attorneys who were discharged prior to their discharge. The Court of Appeals also ruled that the attorneys should each receive a fee equal to the amount recovered from the attorney.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued a temporary restraining order, ordering the settlement of the matter, and ordering the payment of a $165,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlements are subject to approval by the court upon motion by the parties. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Nebraska Department of Insurance in this matter."
