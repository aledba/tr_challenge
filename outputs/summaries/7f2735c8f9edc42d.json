  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against James Brown Green, Jr., a convicted felon, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Green violated Section 15A-1444(a2)(1) of our General Statutes by failing to stipulate to a prior-record-level determination that a prior criminal conviction was a Class 1 felony.  According to the complaint, Green was convicted of a second-degree murder in 1994 and, as a result of his prior conviction, received a prison term of 87 to 117 months, which was in the range of a Class 2 misdemeanor.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Green consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer and director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Green.  Green has agreed to settle the charges against him by consenting to a judgment that permanently restrains his prior convictions as a class 1 felony, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar, with a $75,000 bar for the rest of the year.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert C. McCole granted Green's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered him to surrender his passport, and issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting him from associating with any third-party, including a registered representative, in a public place without a court-issued driver's license.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, with the right to reapply at a later date upon motion by the court upon motion of the court.  To learn more about pre- and post-conviction review, see Litigation Release No. 522-23, 819 S.E.2d (2017).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Criminal Division of the N.C. Division of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter, including the Office of Inspector General's Criminal Investigations."
