  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas yesterday entered a final judgment against St. Luke\u2019s Lakeside Hospital, LLC, a Houston-area medical center, and two cardiothoracic surgeons in connection with their alleged breaches of the standard of care for nurses.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, on January 22, 2016, Thad Manchac developed a severe aortic valve insufficiency and was hospitalized at Memorial Hermann-The Woodlands. The complaint alleges that Dr. Peabody, an infectious disease specialist, and another cardiologist, Paul S. Brown, both of whom also provided expert reports on the Manchacs' claims, failed to adequately assess the cause of the patient's condition and prevented his death.  The complaint further alleges that, based on the expert reports, Dr. Brown and Brown failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their conclusions that the patient would have survived had the surgery been performed within 72 hours.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against each of the defendants. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael O. Williams and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Williams, Ms. Gibson, and Ms. Watson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
