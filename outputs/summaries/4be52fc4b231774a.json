  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against three individuals for their roles in a drug distribution organization.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that the defendants, Nicholas Larry, Nicholas, and Curtis Holmes, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants agreed to settle the charges by agreeing to the entry of a two-level enhancement based on information provided by unreliable confidential informants. The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws and to be barred from serving any prison term.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Nicholas Larry and Nicholas Larry that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and provides for the imposition of a three-level basis enhancement for each defendant. The court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, Geoffrey, Nicholas and Holmes consented to entry of the final judgments that permanently restrains the defendants from violating these provisions. The final judgments also order the defendants not to violate the registration provision of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and impose a five-year bar from purchasing or selling any type of controlled substance, including, without limitation, a 10-year officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2019, the court entered final judgments against the defendants in a related criminal case, ordering Geoffrey to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, and Holmes to pay an $80,000 civil penalty. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Georgia Department of Criminal Justice, and the Georgia State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
