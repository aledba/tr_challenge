  "summary": "On July 19, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut entered a final judgment against Oxford Health Insurance, Inc. (\"Oxford\"), a California-based insurance company, for denying coverage of Benjamin's residential treatment for a mental and/or behavioral health disorder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Connecticut, the court found that defendants had failed to adequately evaluate the merits of their claims.  The complaint alleges that defendants failed to do so by failing to include in their calculations reasonable hours expended on preparing the motion for attorney's fees.  As alleged in the complaint, defendants' inability to pay a reasonable hourly rate constituted a clear error of judgment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against one of the defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Oxford has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay $33,572.50 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the fees it will award to the defendant.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Office of Insurance Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Connecticut Department of Banking and Securities and the Connecticut Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
