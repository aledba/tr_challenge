  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against The Philadelphia Inquirer, PBC, and PA Childcare LLC in an emergency action to unseal documents related to an ongoing criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed on January 10, 2020, alleges that the Pennsylvania Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") improperly unsealed records filed by the Milton Hershey School (MHS), the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (Commission), and Complainant, Pa. Assoc. of Rural and Small Schs. v. Casey, Inc. (Pa. C.D. 2018) improperly sealed records filed with the Commission.  According to the complaint, MHS and the Commission requested the unsealing of the records because they believed they were relevant to the outcome of the criminal case and the need for the court to consider whether public access to those records is a legitimate right under the federal and state laws.  In addition, the complaint alleges that MHS failed to adequately represent the interests of the parties involved in the litigation.  MHS's complaint charges the Commission with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, the Commission has consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering MHS to comply with the SEC's requests for an injunction, and ordering the Commission to provide a copy of the complaint to the court. The Commission has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion by the Commission upon motion of the District of Columbia (\"District of Columbia\").  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by John R. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Press Release No. 524 (January 10, 2019).
