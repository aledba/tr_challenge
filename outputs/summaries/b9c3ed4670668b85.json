  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment in favor of the landlord and tenant defendants in an emergency action for unpaid rent.  The court entered the final judgment against the defendants, who were found liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, defendants entered into a rental agreement for a residential property with the intention of acquiring the property. The complaint alleges that, within a few days of moving in, tenants gave landlords a list of items that they thought needed to be repaired and gave tenants a plumbing tool to use if the problem recurred. The court found that tenants had failed to provide written notice of the habitability issue and asked landlords to lower the rent until tenants paid amounts due for move-in charges, back rent, and unpaid utility bills. In a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating these provisions, the court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against defendants. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Enforcement Division's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oregon Department of Insurance, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency."
