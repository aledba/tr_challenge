  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against the Crowells in a civil injunctive action brought by the Missouri State Tax Commission.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Missouri, alleges that Edward J. and Patricia A. Crowell bought a residential property in Parkville, Missouri in 2014. According to the complaint, the property was built in 1910 and was extensively repaired, renovated, and altered. The complaint alleges that the property's appraised value in 2008 was $210,660 and its assessed value was $43,825.  In 2015, the complaint alleged that the 2008 assessment violated the antifraud provisions of Section 137.115 of the United States Constitution and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the duty of the assessor to determine the true market value of the property at a higher ratio of market value than the other properties assessed.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 5 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their property taxes paid by the other property owners. The final judgment also orders the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to their pre-judgment interest.  On May 2, 2016, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order and ordered them to comply with the court's order. The court also ordered the defendants not to violate the anti-discrimination provisions of the federal securities laws, and to provide a copy of the 2015 appraisal prepared by the county assessor and affirmed by the district attorney. The Commission's order also prohibits the defendants from raising or lowering the appraised values of similarly situated properties, including residential properties, without the assistance of an independent hearing officer. The defendants also have agreed to pay civil penalties of $1,000 each. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The complaint also names as a relief defendant the Missouri Department of Revenue's Office of Economic and Risk Analysis, which uses statistical analysis to detect whether a property is undervalued. The SEC acknowledges the assistance and cooperation of the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri Attorney General's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Missouri Commodity Futures Trading Commission as relief defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted"
