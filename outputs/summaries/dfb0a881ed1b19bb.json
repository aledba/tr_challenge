  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a chiropractor who has agreed to settle charges that he defrauded two insurance companies out of millions of dollars.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that California-based chiropractor Anthony K. Hui made false statements to the Insurance Industry Regulatory Authority (IRA) concerning claims submitted by two women who had been in a car accident.  According to the complaint, Hui's claims were based on non-incidental allegations that he was running a fraudulent chiropractic practice, creating intentional overcharges for services, engaging in fraudulent or improper billing, or performing unnecessary and unauthorized treatments.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Sturbaum told Hui that he had become the target of a DOI investigation \"pursuant to false reports\" submitted by the DOI, and that he should have stopped seeing female patients.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  Hui also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for May 17, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-11.  This case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the San Diego Regional Office."
