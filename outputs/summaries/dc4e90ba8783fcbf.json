  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former cashier who was found not to be an employee of a debtor-owned gas station.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Holbrook, New York, alleges that Sudheer Kumar, a cashier at a Holbrook gas station, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 507(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 50b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Kumar was not employed by the debtor when he was hired by the company, but rather by Keshtgar, a manager at one of the gas stations where Kumar worked.  As alleged, Kumar had access to the company's books and records, and, in response to requests from the debtor, Kumar drove to different gas stations to cover various shifts and pick up cash deposits.  Kumar allegedly acted as a rogue manager in hiring and paying any workers off the books.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Kumar failed to establish a prima facie basis for his employer's claim, and that, in evaluating the burden of proof under the Bankruptcy Code, the court failed to consider whether Kumar was an employee.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Kumar consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $25,161.21 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038.71, a civil penalty of $2,037, and a penny stock bar against him.  On November 9, 2015, the SEC filed an emergency action against Kumar, charging him with violating the anti-fraud and reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against Kumar and a conduct-based injunction against him from further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws and the reporting requirements of Section 5(b) and (c).  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Kumar arising from the same conduct uncovered by the SEC in a separate administrative proceeding.  To determine whether Kumar is entitled to priority for unpaid wages from the bankruptcy estate, the Court issued an order requiring him to provide documentation of his work for the debtor in order to determine whether he qualifies as an \"employee.\"  The court also issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting Kumar from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security"
