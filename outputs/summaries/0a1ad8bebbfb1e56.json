  "summary": "On April 19, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin and its attorney general, Tony Evers, in a parallel action.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Evers and Kaul.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison, Wisconsin, Evers violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder, as well as Section 10(b)(5) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that the Wisconsin legislature violated the First Amendment and the pre-clearance provisions of Sections 369 and 370 of the state constitutions, and that Kaul violated those provisions by acting as an unregistered representative of the newly elected governor and attorney general of Wisconsin.  In addition, the SEC alleges that, as a result of the legislature's actions, the Wisconsin Democratic Party lost its majority in the state House of Representatives.  As a result, the complaint seeks a preliminary injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the First and the Equal Protection Clause, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000, $50,000 and $50 million, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott Frost, Kelly L. Gibson, and John R. Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Wisconsin, and the Wisconsin Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
