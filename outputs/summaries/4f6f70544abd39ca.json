  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found liable for a first-degree rape of a child under the age of thirteen.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, in February 2017, a five-year-old girl reported to her grandfather that E.S.'s \"missy\" was in her mouth and that he had asked her to suck it.  According to the complaint, the complaint further alleges that the victim replied that she did not know the difference between the truth and a lie, and that she was \"extremely skeptical\" of the claims made in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced that it filed criminal charges against the defendant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, and from participating as an officer or director of a public company in any SEC proceeding. The court also granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert witness.  To learn more about child sexual abuse, see Litigation Release No. 15:440.5(C).  The complaint also alleges that Dr. Salcedo, a licensed professional counselor, was not permitted to view the CAC interview because he was not qualified to do so by the SEC. The complaint charges the defendant with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Act Section 15(a) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and penny stock bars against him and any other defendant who is found liable by the court for the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint. The case is being handled by Veronica Serrato, Cheryl Reece, and Amy Gwiazda of the New Orleans Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Louisiana Department of Health and Human Services."
