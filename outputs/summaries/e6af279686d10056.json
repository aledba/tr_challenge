  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a temporary restraining order against three individuals charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Andrew Johnson was admitted to Bowling Green Brandywine Treatment Center on November 25, 2012, with a history of addiction to opiates and benzodiazepines, which had been prescribed for back injuries suffered in an ATV accident. Less than ten days after he was admitted, Johnson was found unresponsive on the floor of his room and subsequently passed away. According to the complaint, Dr. Rana, a registered nurse at the center, had recommended that Johnson be transferred to an emergency room for treatment of mental illness. The complaint also alleges that Dr. Duncklee and Dr. Plumb, emergency room physicians who treated Johnson while he was in the hospital, failed to adequately assess the severity of Johnson's mental illness, and did not timely raise the issue of limited immunity with the trial court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against all of the defendants. The SEC also announced related administrative proceedings against three additional defendants, Mohammad Ali Khan, Asi Khurshid Rana and Jennifer Plumb of Montgomery Hospital, who also were charged in the SEC's action.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.  This case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
