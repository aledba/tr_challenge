  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska on February 21, 2018 entered a final judgment against a former supervisor of the Colfax County Sheriff\u2019s Department who allegedly caused Daniel Coughlin to lose his life in a motor vehicle accident.  The court also found that Daniel had a fixed place of employment when he was injured.  According to the court order, Daniel was driving home from work on January 12, 2016 when he had a cell phone conversation with a deputy who was driving in the opposite lane of traffic.  Daniel had taken off his vest in the course of his shift to exchange shift-change information with the deputy, and the phone ended up dragging the carcass for about 70 feet before the deputy could get to the scene.  As a result, Daniel had to be restrained from using his cell phone while driving, and he was not required to take the overtime to exchange the information with Daniel.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Daniel, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Daniel consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and orders Messerlie to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  On February 22, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Daniel and ordered him to return his patrol car to the County Courthouse to retrieve it from the scene of the accident. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Mark Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Nebraska Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Nebraska Office of Insurance Regulation, the Department of Health and Human Services, the State Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Missouri Department of Banking and Securities, the Kansas Department of State Health and Securities Division and the Missouri Division of Insurance."
