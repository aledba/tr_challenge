  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of South Carolina today entered a final judgment in favor of a North Carolina-based company in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of North Carolina.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Grax Consulting LLC (Grax) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Grax was named as the general partner and an initial limited partner of Beem USA, Limited-Liability Limited Partnership (Beem) on 1 January 2016. The complaint alleges that, from July 2016 until the date of Grax\u2019s removal as general partner, the defendants made numerous trips to North Carolina to open a bank account for Beem and to deposit checks in or initiate wire transfers from North Carolina bank branches. The SEC alleges that the defendants did not have sufficient minimum contacts with the state to exercise specific jurisdiction over Beem.  In addition, the complaint alleges Grax continued to bill and charge Beem despite having access to the partnership account.  Grax also allegedly used his bank account to make wire transfers to and from the bank accounts of other Beem customers.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's Complaint, Grax and Grax consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering Grax to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $3,500, and ordering Grax to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Grax agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and orders him to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $75,000, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Michael L. Robinson of the U. S. District court for the Central District of New York issued a temporary restraining order against Grax, ordering him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, and imposing a $50,000 civil penalty against Grax.  A hearing on August 13, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. for the SEC to consider the merits of the case.  To learn more about liability for liability, see Litigation Release No. 17"
