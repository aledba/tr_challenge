  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment in favor of a workers' compensation claimant who was denied the right to a walk-in tub.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, Cheryl M. McCain was injured after being bitten on the knee by a large dog. The complaint alleges that the medical director of Motel 6, Dr. Fayez Shamieh, denied the claimant's request for a walk in tub, and instead approved the purchase and installation of a \"whirlpool or spas\" that are not necessary to maintain function and/or analgesic effect under the medical treatment guidelines.  The complaint further alleges that Ms. Keen, who is employed by Mrs. McCain's counsel, called numerous vendors to discuss the availability of the walk-ins tub, including those listed in the complaint.  She also allegedly called numerous providers to check whether they had sufficient medical evidence to support the claim.  In a parallel action, the SEC today announced that it had issued a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay $2,500,000 in penalties and attorney fees.  On May 1, 2019, the court issued its judgment against the defendants, ordering them to pay a total of $5,000.00 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering the payment of civil penalties, attorney fees, and injunctive relief. The SEC's investigation was conducted by David A. Ardoin and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. McCann. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the United States Postal Inspection Service."
