  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of a California-based nonprofit organization that seeks to enforce the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, alleges that, in 2014, Stephen Kuhn, a resident of Altadena, California, and his neighbor, Randall Baer, filed an emergency action to halt construction of a single-family home on his undeveloped property.  According to the complaint, Kuhn and Baer agreed to settle the case by agreeing to a temporary restraining order, an attorney general order, and an order requiring the county to prepare an environmental impact report.  Kuhn also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $7,500.  In a parallel action, on April 19, 2018, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office announced criminal charges against Kuhn.  On May 9, 2017, the court granted the SEC's motion for an administrative stay of the defendants\u2019 applications for an emergency court-ordered injunction, ordered Kuhn to comply with the court\u2019s orders, and ordered Baer and the Lynches to pay civil penalties of $10,000 each.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 1021.5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, and 13b-20 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $5,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Public Works and Fire Department."
