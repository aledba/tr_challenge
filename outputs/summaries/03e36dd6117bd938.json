  "summary": "On May 31, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans entered a final judgment ordering the eviction of two New Orleans residents from a condominium building.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on April 5, 2018 and unsealed on May 24, 2017, Clifford Abel, a security guard employed by New Orleans Private Patrol, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the complaint, Mr. Abel, who resides in Florida, repeatedly called and texted his mother, Trisha Loporto, who was watching television in the room.  He also allegedly told her that he was going to \"tormented [him] every day.\"  The complaint further alleges that the SCCA did not establish by what authority it sought to evict him, and that he \"failed to comply with the requirements of the lease\" by filing his answer under oath.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he received no \"verbal or written\" from the manager or assistant manager of the condominium, and he \"never harassed or intimidated other resident[s\").  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against Abel.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $250,000, and ordering Abel to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer and director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the New Orleans Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Paul McNair.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
