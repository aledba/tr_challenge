  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment in favor of Intra-Cellular Therapeutics, Inc., a medical device company based in Alexandria, Virginia, that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also granted the company's request for a temporary restraining order against future violations of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Alexandria on July 7, 2017, the Patent Office announced that it had issued an order suspending the application pending final approval of a final Office action.  In its order, the court found that IntraCellular failed to comply with all of the requirements set forth in the PTA, including that the application was entitled to a final action, and that it failed to meet those requirements.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the company agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating these provisions and ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, a $50,000 civil penalty, and a $100,000 penalty.  Intra and its co-defendant, Novartis AG, agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction, which will permanently enjoin them from future violations, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Virginia Office of Inspector General in this matter."
