  "summary": "On August 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a former registered representative who was found disabled by a disability hearing officer based on \"the evidence in the file.\"  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City on May 5, 2016, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that the former representative had a history of osteoporosis and had been diagnosed with osteopenia in 2011.  The complaint alleges that the ALJ failed to fully develop the record of her disability, and instead failed to consider the fact that she was not receiving specialized treatment for her condition.  In a written judgment issued June 21, 2014, the AlJ found her not disabled, and ordered her to be sent out for a consultative examination.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $5,000.  Additionally, the court entered a temporary restraining order against her from further violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and Rule 12b-20 thereunder.  On August 6, 2018 the SEC filed a complaint against the Aljazeera-based telemarketer for failing to develop a record of Plaintiff's disability.  It also alleged that the SEC failed to adequately evaluate her medical history, including her history of cancer, her previous work as a real estate agent, her surgical history, and her previous medical treatment.  Finally, the SEC charged a former certified physical therapist for her role in this matter, and the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against her.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Perales and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Mr. Piales. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and other emergency relief."
