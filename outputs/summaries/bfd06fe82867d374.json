  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a California-based hospital for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1278 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 1278-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, on January 16, 2012, a physician who complained about poor patient care at Sutter Central Valley Hospital in Rancho Mirage, California was barred from participating in any peer review proceeding. The complaint alleges that the hospital initiated peer review proceedings against Armin based on his complaints about the hospital's lackadaisical approach to urgent care, and that Armin was not entitled to participate in the peer review process. Armin's complaint also alleges that, as a result of his complaint, the hospital terminated his privileges.  The SEC's order against the hospital, which was entered yesterday, permanently enjoins Armin from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $12,440 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the physician. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action in its parallel action against a hospital for its role in a similar conduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Armin has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 805, 809, and 809 of the Business and Professions Code, and ordering the hospital to comply with the court's order. The judgment also orders Armin to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and a $20,000 officer-and-director bar. The court also granted Armin a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return to his previous employer, the California Department of Health and Human Services, to pay an $8,500 civil penalty, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public health institution. The order also prohibits the hospital from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in securities of any securities, and from imposing a penny stock bar against him.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Office of Compliance and Assurance, and the litigation will be led by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by San Diego Regional Office staff. The examination that led to the discovery of the alleged misconduct was conducted by David A. Kasper of the San Diego Office of Public Health. The investigation was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.
