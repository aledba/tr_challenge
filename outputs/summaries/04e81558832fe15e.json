  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against a former foster parent who was found guilty of physical abuse by a juvenile court in 2017 of denying her de facto parent status.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles on September 25, 2017, Justin and David were placed in the care of Grandmother, who had been placed in her care since 2008. The complaint alleges that in September 2017, the juvenile court found that Grandmother had suffered from attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and bipolar depression.  The complaint further alleges that after Grandmother was placed in Grandmother's care, she repeatedly hit Justin and his cousin, Shane, with a ruler, causing Justin to fall and hit his head.  As alleged in the complaint, Grandmother continued to hit Justin, and in August 2015, the court issued a temporary restraining order preventing Grandmother from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the California Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order suspending Grandmother and ordering her to return the children to her custody.  To learn more about de facto parental status, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.
