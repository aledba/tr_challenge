  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment against Big-D Construction, LLC, a Utah-based construction company, and its owner, Neal Hikida, for defrauding their clients.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 6, 2016, filed in federal court in Wyoming, the defendants agreed to settle the litigation without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  The SEC alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Utah announced criminal charges against the defendants.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, the Defendants' fees and costs were improperly included in the settlement agreement and were not offset by the fees owed to the parties in the earlier litigation.   The complaint also alleges that, based on the facts and legal arguments presented to the court, Defendants were barred from recovering their attorney fees.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose that they had improperly included over $25,000 in attorney fees not related to the instant litigation action in which they were charged.  Additionally, the Complaint alleges that Defendants failed to adequately disclose to their clients that the fees were being paid directly to the defendant, not to the party's attorney, and that defendants' fees were excessive or improper.  Finally, the Court found that the Defendants violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws and that the parties were entitled to a share of the proceeds as well as their reasonable costs and attorney fees from the settlement. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Denver Regional Office and is being supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Leland Stanford, Jr. and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Utah Attorney General's Office, and the Utah State Corporation Commission in this matter."
