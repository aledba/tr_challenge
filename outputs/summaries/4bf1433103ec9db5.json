  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Bureau of the Census and ordered the agency to pay $3.5 million in civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, during the partial government shutdown, the Bureau issued a series of false and misleading statements, including that it was preparing to conduct the 2020 Census when it had no funding to do so. The complaint also alleges that the Bureau failed to adequately assess the impact of its underfunding on the agency's preparedness and preparedness for the 2020 census.  According to the complaint, these false statements were the basis for the Bureau's refusal to respond to the Commission's requests for funds.  In addition, the complaint alleges that during its planning for the census the Bureau increased the number of field offices it had in reserve, despite the fact that the Commission had not requested any additional funding for the Census.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (\"Advisers\").  The final judgments also order the Bureau to pay civil penalties in the amount of $3,551,388,000, which is equal to disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,500.  Additionally, the court has ordered the FBI to conduct a background check on potential violators of the federal securities laws.  On February 15, 2020, the Commission issued an order requiring the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security to conduct an annual census. The order requires the FBI, the Departmentof Homeland Security, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to provide assistance in this matter. The Commission's order requires that the FBI perform its due diligence before it makes a determination about whether or how to proceed with the census, and that the agency has a duty to provide timely and accurate information about the progress of the census. In a parallel action, the SEC today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting the federal government shutdown and ordering the FBI's investigation of possible misconduct in the Census Bureau. The agency's investigation has been conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI."
