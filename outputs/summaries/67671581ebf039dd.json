  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against InFirst Bank, Inc., a Pennsylvania-based private equity firm, for failing to remediate manure located on the company's property.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on June 28, 2019, the Debtors filed a motion to reconsider, seeking a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other relief.  The complaint alleges that the debtors failed to adequately remediate the manure on the property, and the court issued an order requiring that they submit a plan of reorganization by the end of the month.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.   The court's order also prohibits defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with a pending bankruptcy proceeding.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 17(b)(2)(A).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Banking and Securities, the Philadelphia Office of Financial Regulation and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
