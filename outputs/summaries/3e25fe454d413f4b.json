  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Robert B. Machinist, Jr., a defendant who was found in contempt of a court order that ordered him to pay $160,000 in alimony and child support.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on February 2, 2007, the defendants' twenty-nine year marriage was dissolved pursuant to a detailed separation agreement negotiated by the parties with the assistance of counsel. The complaint alleges that, from the date of the dissolution through December 31, 2013, the defendant underpaid the plaintiff by $9602.62 as her share of the income in the amount of $400,000 of income.  The complaint further alleges that the court improperly failed to find the defendant in contempt for underpaying the plaintiff in 2007.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of $150,025 plus interest and a penalty equal to the amount owed to the defendant.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $9,500. The judgment also prohibits the defendants from acting as unregistered brokers or agents of any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The court also granted the defendants the right to reapply after five years.  On May 31, 2011, a federal district court in New York entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants, freezing their assets, and ordering the parties to pay civil penalties of $20,000 and $30,000, respectively. The defendants also agreed to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-registered broker or dealer, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security. The settlement is subject to court approval.
