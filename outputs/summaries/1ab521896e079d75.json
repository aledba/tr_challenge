  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Schenectady man accused of orchestrating a triple-murder that left the victim's mother and sister in the hospital.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, Joseph Lewis, who was previously convicted of two counts of second-degree murder in the second degree, told the court that defendant had been making money by \"pimping\" the victim.  The complaint alleges that, in the months leading up to the murder, defendant told the victim that he was going to make extra money by \u201chiding\u201d the fact that the victim had been shot in the head.  He also allegedly claimed that he had seen the victim in lingerie before the murder and that, when confronted by the victim, defendant replied, \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\"  The SEC alleges that the court improperly denied defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction, which would have prohibited him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Lewis consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered final judgments against Lewis, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, imposing a $10,000 civil penalty, and ordering him from participating in any future offering of a penny stock.  On the same day, the court denied Lewis's motion to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and ordered Lewis to pay disgorgement of $2,038,078, which is equal to the amount of his already-ordered civil penalty.  A hearing scheduled for May 5, 2019, is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2019.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Andrew Dannible, Michael Sikirica, and Antonia Garcia of the New York office, and was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the"
