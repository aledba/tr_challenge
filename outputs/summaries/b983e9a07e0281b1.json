  "summary": "On August 14, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Commissioner of Social Security for failing to determine whether a child with ADHD was disabled.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that on April 16, 2013, Lisa B. Herrera filed an application for childhood disability on behalf of her nephew, R.S., alleging that he suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  The complaint alleges that plaintiff suffered from the following severe impairments: ADHD, bipolar disorder, and a history of speech problems.  According to the complaint, plaintiff's impairments, considered individually or in combination, did not meet or medically equal a listed impairment.  In addition, plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that would qualify him as disabled, despite repeated reminders not to do so.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Herrera consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Brooklyn, N.Y., seeking a temporary restraining order, an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the defendant's medical record, and to issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation.  On August 17, 2017 the SEC issued an order ordering the receiver to conduct a controlled background check on the defendant and to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver.   The order also requires that the receiver be present at all times, including during school hours, to ensure that any evidence of impairment is consistent with the evidence presented in the complaint.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (Aug. 14, 2013).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Herrera. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigation Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage parents to check the background of their children by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Advocacy.gov website to identify signs of impairment.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Office of Education and the Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has instituted an Office of Child and Family Education (OIEA) to detect signs of developmental impairment in children."
