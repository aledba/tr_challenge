  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois yesterday entered a final judgment against two home healthcare companies and their associated entities for conducting an illegal patient referral scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, alleges that Management Principles, Inc. and its associated entities violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants used confidential information obtained from HCI caseworkers to solicit and receive referrals from seniors at home and out of nursing homes. The complaint alleges that the defendants made monthly payments to HCI in return for access to the non-profit\u2019s client records and then used that information to solicit new patients for services that would be paid for by a federal healthcare program.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Management Principles and its affiliated entities consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal and state False Claims Acts and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $90,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Mascianica entered a judgment against Management Principles that permanently restrains the defendants from future violations of the federal, state, and federal securities laws. The court also ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each, and ordered them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest of $20,000, and to pay disgorgement of $5,000 plus interest in the amount of $10,000 and a $50,000 civil penalty, respectively.   The court's order also prohibits defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a civil injunctive relief, including an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
