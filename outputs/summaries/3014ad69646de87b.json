  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Damion Faulkner.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Nashville, Tennessee, alleges that, from at least childhood on, he engaged in a long-running pattern of sexual misconduct.  According to the complaint, beginning in the early 2000s, when he was nine years old, Faulkowski began to engage in a series of sexually aggressive activities, including taking photographs of his own five-year-old niece and two other girls while they were in the shower.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants engaged in this conduct in the course of recording and disseminating child pornography.  In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained a court order halting the production of child pornography and imposing a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years on each of the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint or the facts of the case, the court has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against each of them.  Additionally, the judge has ordered the defendant to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  To settle the SEC\u2019s charges, the defendant has consented to a permanent injunction, to be barred from associating with like-minded individuals, and to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations.  He has also agreed to a $50,000 penalty and to a five-month bar from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Tennessee, the FBI, and the Tennessee Department of Criminal Justice.  For further information, see SEC Complaint No. 17-cv-01221 (March 21, 2018)."
