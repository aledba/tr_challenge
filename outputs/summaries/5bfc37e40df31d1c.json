  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment in favor of a Kentucky-based company and its employee in connection with a July 1, 2012 car crash that left four injured passengers with broken jaw and required emergency medical treatment.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Louisville, Kentucky, alleges that the trial court improperly excluded the testimony of an expert witness who had been injured in the crash and failed to instruct the jury as to whether he was entitled to punitive damages.  According to the complaint, Zewoldi's expert testimony, which was contemporaneous with the facts of the case, was untimely and unrecorded.

App. 2010).  In a parallel action, the Kentucky Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed an emergency action to halt the pending litigation against Bryant and his company, Kentucky Milk Marketing and Antimonopoly Comm. Ltd. (KMGTC).  The court's order also issued an order temporarily suspending Bryant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering him to sign a civil injunctive proceeding against the defendants.  This order temporarily prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any medical records, including those of a licensed physician, and requires him to provide written testimony in the course of the litigation.
