  "summary": "On May 4, 2009, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of South Carolina entered a final judgment against the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Inc. (\"Church\") and Beaufort County, S.C. (\"Zoning Board\") in a civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's complaint, on December 4, 1996, the church applied for a development permit for a 15,280 square foot building on property in Beaufort, South Carolina. The complaint alleges the church's application for a new development permit was denied because it did not have a vested right to complete the project.  The complaint further alleges the Church's 1997 development permit did not cover the fellowship hall and sanctuary, and the church delayed building the building until after it learned of the new restrictions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for South Carolina today announced criminal charges against the church.  On May 5, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Charleston, SC, alleging that the church violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Church consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The judgment also orders the church to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500, and orders the Church to pay civil penalties of $500,000 and $1 million, respectively.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Bort. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FINCA) in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
