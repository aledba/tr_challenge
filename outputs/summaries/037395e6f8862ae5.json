  "summary": "The Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order granting the SEC's request for an asset freeze and other emergency relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, alleges that the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 4(l) of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, MHS, a private school located in Pennsylvania, was not a public accommodation under the federal law and, therefore, could not succeed in its claim that the Commission lacked jurisdiction to determine whether MHS was a \"public accommodation.\"  The complaint further alleges that, in its motion for review, the Commission improperly denied MHS's request to have an evidentiary hearing.  In its order, the SEC alleges that MHS violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and 10(b)(5)(A).  The Commission's order, which is subject to court approval, requires MHS to respond to the Commission's requests for an expedited hearing by providing an explanation for why it has not acted on its findings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the school consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal laws, orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requires it to submit a civil injunctive action.  MHS also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  On June 26, 2019, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office issued an order suspending MHS from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney, and ordering the school to comply with the order.   The order also prohibits MHS and its principal from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of service.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1798 (April 16, 2019).  In a parallel action, the U-S Attorney's Office for Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against MHS arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.
