  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia today entered a final judgment against the Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cranberry Pipeline Corporation, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Raleigh County, West Virginia, alleges that, in 1929, Beaver Coal Corporation and Godfrey L. Cabot, Inc. entered into a lease agreement that provided for the right to mine, explore, extract, and remove oil and gas from the company's property.  According to the complaint, however, that agreement was not binding upon the parties, and that the arbitration panel relied upon Wellman, a West Virginia resident, in rendering its award.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Beaver and its subsidiaries have consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion by the parties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for West Virginia announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On August 25, 2016, the court issued an order ordering the parties to arbitration on all claims, including Beaver's, alleging that the company had violated the arbitration provision in the 1929 Lease and that it had improperly obtained a court order requiring it to determine the threshold issues of whether a valid arbitration agreement existed between the parties and whether that arbitration award was binding upon those parties. The court also ordered the defendants to submit proposed orders to the arbitrators on the issues to be resolved by the date of the arbitration decision.  As part of the settlement, the parties agreed to pay a total of $1.8 million in civil penalties and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (January 24, 2020).  The Commission on Audit and Rulemaking has issued an Order Order appointing an independent receiver to determine whether to issue an order appointing a receiver pursuant to the relevant federal law. The Commission has also appointed a receiver to deal with any claims that arise from the Commission's referral of the parties' claims to arbitration.  Among other things, the Commission has issued a subpoena for a copy of the subpoena, which is required by the federal law to resolve all disputes arising under the lease through binding arbitration.\u00c2\u00a0 The Commission's order appointing the receiver will determine the relative positions of those parties in this matter."
