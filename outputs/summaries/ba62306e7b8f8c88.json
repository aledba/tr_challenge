  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida yesterday entered a final judgment in contempt of court against Chad Godwin, a Florida man, and his wife, Stephanie Ann Festa, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, alleges that the trial court erred in finding Chad in contempt for having his significant other at his daughter's doctor's appointment and acting beyond transport.  According to the complaint, the court also found the Former Husband in contempt because he repeatedly violated the provisions of the SEC's final judgment and improperly granted relief to the former wife.  In addition, the complaint alleges the court improperly granted the former Husband's request for attorney's fees and costs without the former Wife filing a proper petition for an injunction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Chad has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his legal fees and expenses.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Conrrad of the Miami Regional Office granted Chad's motion for contempt and issued a temporary restraining order against him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The court also granted Chad the right to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, a penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  As part of the settlement, Chad will be required to pay a $75,000 civil penalty, which will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Feb. 13, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Florida Office of Advocacy and Advocacy. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Miami Office of Financial Regulation, and the Office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central Florida Division of Criminal Justice."
