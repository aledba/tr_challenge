  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against Kansas Secretary of State Kris W. Kobach in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that Kobach violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Kansas Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) by failing to provide timely and sufficient evidence to justify his imposition of the DPOC requirement.  According to the complaint, Kobach also failed to provide sufficient evidence that he was a Kansas resident when he was denied registration for failure to provide DPOC.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of Kobach\u2019s conduct, the Missouri Department of State Board of Elections (DOTA) issued a temporary restraining order preventing Kobach from violating the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the DOTA has agreed to a permanent injunction against Kobach and to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, 1320, 1321, 1322, 1323, 1324, 1325, 1326, 1327, 1329, 1330, 1331, 1332, 1333, 1334, 1336, and 1333. The court also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Kansas from violating these provisions, and orders Kobach to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of money he has already paid to settle the litigation.  On May 24, 2020, the Honorable Judge Robert A. Hannan of the U. S. District court for the Eastern District of Missouri granted the SEC and DOTAs an emergency relief request. The Court also issued an order temporarily suspending the registration of certain Kansas residents, including Mr. Fish and Ms. Bucci, from participating in the 2018 municipal elections. The order also prohibits the issuance or purchase of any security-related documents, including a copy of the voter registration application. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Fish and Bucci. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Justice. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter, and the Kansas Attorney General's Office has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint"
