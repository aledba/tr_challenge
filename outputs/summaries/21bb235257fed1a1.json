  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of aiding and abetting the murder of a rival gang member.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Sebastian Santana and David Venegas were out prowling for rivals to shoot when they were confronted by three hired killers who sought to kill Acevedo. The SEC alleges that, according to the complaint, the defendants sought to use a.45 caliber pistol to kill the rival, who was in a gang war with Fraser Maravilla. The complaint alleges that the defendants used the.45 to carry out their plan, and that VenEGas used the gun to shoot the rival.  According to the SEC's order, however, the defendant knew he could count on a friend or gang member to shoot him and did not use the gun.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On January 1, 2019, the court entered a not guilty plea and suspended the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of the case. The court granted the defendants\u2019 requests for a preliminary injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar. The defendants agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  To learn more about the SEC, see SEC Litigation Release No. 1393 (2019).  The case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the SEC Division of Criminal Justice.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Marc Blau of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General."
