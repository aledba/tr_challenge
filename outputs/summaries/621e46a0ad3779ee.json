  "summary": "On November 12, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered final judgments against Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc. and Dresdner Bank AG in a fraud case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, between 2005 and 2007, Morgan Stanley and its investment adviser, Dresdger Advisors, LLC, issued several classes of notes on a rolling basis, which received top credit ratings from Moody's and S&P. The complaint alleges that the parties to the sale of the notes agreed that any causes of action related to the notes would automatically transfer to Dresdler.  According to the complaint, however, the defendants did not, as a matter of law, assign all of the potential fraud claims to the rating agencies.  Instead, the complaint alleges, they simply assigned the notes to the third party.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in the amount of $1.8 million.  On November 13, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Manhattan charging the defendants with violating Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10b of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b2-1 and Rule10b-2 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting the defendants' violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorging illusory gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17.  This case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the SEC's New York Regional Office.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Mr. Karpel. The case is being supervised by Chedly L. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Office of the Secretary of the Department of Justice (DOJ) in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov."
