  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for improperly approving an exemption to the minimum offer price rule for certain renewable energy resources.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the Commission violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its order approving the exemption, the Commission determined that the exemption creates unjust, unreasonable, and unduly discriminatory prices for certain of the renewable resources in the market.  According to the complaint, the exemption is based on a fact-specific balancing test, which is used by the Commission to determine whether an exemption is just and reasonable.  For example, the complaint alleges that when the Commission initially approved the renewable exemption in May 2014, it did not consider the potential for price suppression when determining whether to grant the exemption. Rather, it relied on expert testimony that predicted the potential price suppression would be minimal because the exemption would be implemented at a \"just and reasonable\" rate.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, FERC agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from acting unreasonably and capricious in its evaluation of the exemption and orders it to provide an accounting of the price suppression. The final judgment also prohibits the Commission from imposing a price-reduction bar on any renewable energy resource, and from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer or dealer in a public offering of a renewable energy product.  On May 30, 2014, the SEC granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 206 of the Federal Power Act, and ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of the market and determine whether to issue an order requiring a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 206. The Commission also issued an order suspending the registration of certain microcap companies, including NextEra Energy Resources, LLC, GenOn Energy Management LLC, Middletown Power LLC, Montville Power LLC and Norwalk Power LLC. The SEC is continuing its investigation of these issuers, and the case is being handled by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica and Ms. Scarlato, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov."
