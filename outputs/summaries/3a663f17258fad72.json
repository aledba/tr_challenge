  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against Richard Lamar Green, Jr., a convicted felon, for the attempted murder and kidnapping of his wife, Cathleen Green (\u201cCathy\u201d).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, Green was convicted of the attempted murders of Cathy and her four-year-old son, and was sentenced to life imprisonment.  The SEC alleges that Green used a machete to strike Cathy in the head, which caused her to fall to the floor of the bank vault.  As alleged in the complaint, Green's actions were inconsistent with the evidence presented to the court, and the jury was unable to determine whether Green had abandoned his attempt to murder Cathy and that he had left with their son.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Green arising from the same conduct.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Green, charging him with one count of attempted murder, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Green agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint.  After the settlement was reached, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Green and ordered him to return to his home, which he did not do until after he left the home.  Without admitting to the charges, Green consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States or in the sale or promotion of any security, including the right to apply for a penny stock, and orders him to surrender and be permanently enjoined from violating Section 97-1-7(2).  The court also granted Green's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 9(a)(1) and (3) the registration provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(c) thereunder of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. McCluskey and supervised by Scott A. McKinley of the Mississippi Office of the Attorney General. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. McCreary."
