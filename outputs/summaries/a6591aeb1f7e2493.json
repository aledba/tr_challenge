  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of aiding and abetting a federal criminal prosecution.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that former New York State senator John Sampson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that Sampson aided and abetted the prosecution of Edul Ahmad, a New York City businessman who was charged with fraud in connection with a mortgage fraud scheme.  According to the complaint, Sampson told the FBI that he did not see the check register page, and that he would use his position as a referee to obtain an attorney for Ahmad should he choose to cooperate with the government.  Sampson also allegedly told FBI agent Roger Hirsch, Roger Khan, and Premaj Hansraj that he never asked his Senate colleague to help him with the mortgage fraud.  He also allegedly claimed that he had received calls from an FBI agent who asked him to help with the investigation of Ahmad\u2019s mortgage fraud, but did not return the call.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $188,500, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced parallel criminal charges against Sampson, charging him with violating Section 1523 of the Exchange Act, and with violating Rule 1524.  On May 4, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the New York District Court issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order, ordering Sampson to surrender his passport, and requiring him to provide a copy of the FBI's complaint to the court.  An SEC order appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver will be instituted on June 22, 2020.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-cr-269 (January 24, 2020).  The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Finally, the complaint charges Sampson with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Rules 10b-20, 13a-1, and Rule 10b"
