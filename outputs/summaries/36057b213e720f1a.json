  "summary": "The Massachusetts Department of Correction today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing administrative proceeding against former Commissioner of Correction Luis S. Spencer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Massachusetts, alleges that, on July 23, 2014, Spencer resigned from his position as commissioner of the department of corrections in order to avoid further scrutiny of his performance during a high profile investigation of Bridgewater State Hospital.  According to the complaint, Spencer was told that his resignation was a \"termination of his service\" and that he would be entitled to a right to revert back to his prior civil service position upon his retirement.  As alleged, however, the complaint alleges that Spencer was misled or compelled to resign because he was aware of the intense public scrutiny, the Governor's and the Secretary's insistence that he resign or be terminated, and that there was no basis for his resignation.  In a parallel action, the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Spencer, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Spencer consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Spencer also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar, with the option of remaining in the department as a commissioner for a period of five years, or to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the company's name, and requires him to provide a copy of his resignation letter to the department's compliance officer.  On July 28, 2015, the court granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order against Spencer and ordered him to return to his previous civil service post.  After a hearing on July 31, Spencer agreed to the order.  A hearing on August 5, 2016, was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. EST.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Compliance and Assessments and Examinations by John R. Rymas of the Boston Regional Office, with assistance from Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, under the supervision of Robert A. Hannan. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Health and Human Services."
