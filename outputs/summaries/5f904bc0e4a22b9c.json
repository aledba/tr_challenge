  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Individual Advocacy Group, Inc., a non-profit organization that provides residential services to adults with disabilities, against the City of Springfield's request for a preliminary injunction.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Springfield, Illinois on December 22, 2016, the city of Springfield issued a temporary restraining order and obtained an emergency court order halting the eviction of three disabled individuals.  The complaint alleges that the city violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder, and the \"reasonable accommodation\" provision of the federal securities laws.  In addition, the complaint alleges the city failed to provide reasonable accommodation for the disabled individuals in violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the City consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the city from violating these provisions, and orders the city to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (Aug. 24, 2016).
