  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of a long-running drug conspiracy.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, alleges that Evans Santos Diaz, a former officer of the Drug Enforcement Administration's (DEA) Task Force Force, provided false testimony to the court in connection with a drug conspiracy case.  According to the complaint, Diaz told the court that he was bagging up drugs for Jeffrey Guzman and selling them to his own customers, and that Guzman was responsible for more than 20 grams of heroin.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Diaz repeatedly worked for or sought work from Guzman at the direction of Guzman.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, Diaz was not a \"co-defendant\" and did not participate in the drug conspiracy as described in the complaint.  Instead, Diaz allegedly worked as Guzman\u2019s subordinate, bagging and distributing drugs.  Guzman allegedly used Diaz to bag up the drugs for Guzman, and to sell the drugs to Guzman through his mother, who was also involved in the scheme.  After Guzman consented to the entry of the final judgment, the court issued an order acknowledging receipt of a letter from Diaz, directing the court to forward a copy of the letter to counsel, and ordering Gula to comply with the order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint or the findings of the SEC, Gula agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Rule 701(b) of the federal securities laws.  He also agreed to pay a civil penalty of 33 months imprisonment and three years of supervised release.  Gula will be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and will be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to apply for a penny stock, as well as the duty to protect the interests of the company and its officers.  On March 24, 2017, the District Court granted a motion for continuance in the case against Gula, which was entered by the SEC on April 5, 2017.  A hearing scheduled for May 10, 2018, was not conducted to consider the merits of the case, but instead to consider whether Gula was competent to represent the defendant in a timely fashion.  Finally, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
