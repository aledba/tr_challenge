  "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing litigation action by CalPERS, the largest state public pension fund in the country, alleging that the rating agencies violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, in 2006 and early 2007, the Rating Agencies issued SIV ratings to three structured investment vehicles that ultimately collapsed, causing billions of dollars in losses to investors.  According to the complaint, the ratings were based on \"pre-trade information\" that was not available in the market at the time of the ratings' issuance.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the ratings directly related to the risk of a market interruption, which could result in the SIVs' collapse.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, these ratings are not actionable because they do not reflect the true state of the rated securities.  Rather, the SEC alleges that they relied on the representations provided in the ratings, which were false and misleading.  For example, as set forth in the Complaint:  The ratings were not available to the general public until the rating agency issued the ratings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint and in its order to halt the litigation, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the anti-SLAPP provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On October 4, 2010, the court granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order and a temporary injunction, which is subject to court approval, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1.4 million.  Cal&rsquo;s investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Office of the Secretary of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California."
