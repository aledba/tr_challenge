  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 18 months in prison for violating the terms of his supervised release.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, John Paul Everhart, II, was sentenced on January 18, 2011, to a five-month term of imprisonment, followed by no more than 120 days in a halfway house facility and a life term of supervised release, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  The complaint alleges that Everhart violated the supervised release conditions because he repeatedly violated the conditions of his release, including that he had committed a drug offense but not any crimes against minors; (1) he had been convicted of a felony; (2) he was a skilled chef who could contribute to society with his training as a chef; (3) his failure to be deterred by prior revocation sentences; (4) his inability to participate in court-ordered sex offender treatment; (5) his difficulty accepting responsibility; (6) the need to protect the public from Everhart\u2019s future violations and crimes; (7) his lack of self-control; (8) his apparent disrespect for the law, the court, and various authority figures; and (9) his refusal to cooperate with his probation officer.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Everhart.  On March 26, 2019, the District Court issued an order suspending Everhart from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Office of Inspector General, and the U.N. Secret Service."
