  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against a defendant who has agreed to settle charges that he induced a jury to reject his motion for an ineffective assistance of counsel.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Justin William Popp, a convicted felon who was previously sentenced to prison for sodomy on a child, failed to adequately disclose to a jury that he had engaged in a series of unprovoked acts of sexual misconduct with a child. Popp also alleges that, in one instance, Popp asked a jury member to interview him after learning that his mother had refused to participate in a pre-arrest interview with the child. The jury deliberated for about ten minutes, and Popp ultimately agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $25,000. The court also ordered Popp to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $5,000, and to pay civil penalties of $20,000 and $10,500, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Popp. The SEC also announced related civil injunctive relief.  On March 5, 2017, the court granted Popp a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 15.5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 15.7 thereunder. The Court granted the request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of the evidence in the case. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley and supervised by Amy S. Cotter."
