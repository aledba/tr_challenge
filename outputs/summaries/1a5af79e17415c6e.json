  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Missouri announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against Danny Dixon for violating the federal sex offender registration laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Missouri, alleges that Dixon violated the federal registration laws by telling a fifteen-year-old girl over the telephone that she sounded and looked sexy, and asked her about her sexual activity.  According to the complaint, Dixon pleaded guilty in November 2003 to a class C felony and was subsequently sentenced to two years of probation.  In 2018, the Missouri Attorney General's Office filed an emergency action to remove Dixon from the sex offender registry, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 566.095 of the federal criminal code.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Dixon consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the registration provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of one year and a $10,000 civil penalty.  Dixon also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and to be subject to lifetime registration.  On August 28, 2018, a federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, granted Dixon's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  As part of the settlement, Dixon agreed to a permanent injunction, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and a five-year officer-and-director bar.  To settle the SEC\u2019s charges, Dixon was also ordered to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, plus prejudgment interest of $2,038.71 and a penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 566-095.  This matter was investigated by the Missouri Department of Justice and the Office of Inspector General, and the case was supervised by Scott Frost, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Criminal Investigations Division. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Postal Inspection Service and the Missouri Office of Child and Family Services."
