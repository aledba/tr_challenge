  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, Kevin S. Lasecki, a former Vice President of Sales at Bath Solutions, Inc., was charged with violating Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder and Section 17(a)(1) of Rule 15a-3 thereunder, and was ordered to pay $2,850.00 per month in child support and $1,385.00 in attorney\u2019s fees.  The SEC alleges that, in a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against him.  In its order, the court found that Plaintiff violated Section 15A-1, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $10,905.00.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Plaintiff consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge $1.8 million in ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requires him to repay $9,592.50 in attorney's fees, which he has already repaid to his wife.  On May 24, 2016, the trial court entered a temporary restraining order against Plaintiff, ordering him to comply with the court order, ordering a hearing on May 25, 2016 and ordering a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 15a of the Exchange Act, ordering the payment of civil penalties in the amount of $6,853.00, and ordering the filing of a civil injunctive action against Plaintiff against the other parties.  A hearing scheduled for May 26, 2016 is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Mascianica.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for North Carolina and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
