  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against California-based oil and gas company Kinder Morgan Material Services, LLC (KMS) in a civil injunctive action brought by Concerned Citizens of Stockton, Inc. (Citizens for Sensible Planning) (CSP). The court found that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 21167(d) of the federal securities laws. The court also found that, contrary to representations made to the court, Kinder Morgan did not violate the discovery rule, which requires a court to determine when a project is subject to CEQA review. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Stockton on August 10, 2016, the court granted the defendants' motion for a writ of mandate and a temporary restraining order, and ordered the company to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations, and the litigation will be led by John Rymas. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Secretary of State's Office, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service (FINRA), and the California Office of Regulatory Affairs (OIEA) in this matter.  The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov website\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to identify whether their investments are subject to reasonable diligence."
