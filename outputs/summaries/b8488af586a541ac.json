  "summary": "On May 25, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants and against the defendants on their common-law fraud claim.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, the defendants failed to adequately record the amount of attorney fees incurred by the defendants in the prosecution of their claim under the Exchange Act.  As alleged in the complaint, defendants falsely claimed that they incurred no attorney fees when, in fact, they incurred more than $58,000 in attorney fees.  In fact, the court found the defendants liable for the fees incurred and, as a consequence, ordered the defendants to pay a total of $86,712.50 for attorney fees, costs, and expenses.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, both defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On June 4, 2018 the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction and entered a judgment against Lau and against both defendants, permanently enjoining the defendants from violating these provisions, ordering Lau to pay $68,336.76 in fees and costs, ordering him to disgorge $6,078.71 in fees, and imposing a civil penalty of $8,098.76. The court also issued an order suspending Lau from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering her to pay an $80,000 civil penalty. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John P. Sorce, Bennett J. Baker, and Kirsten M. Dunne. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Attorney General's Office, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter.
