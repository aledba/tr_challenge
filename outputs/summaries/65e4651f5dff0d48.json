  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Avery Tumer and co-conspirator Timotheus Reed in a carjacking case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Tumer, a resident of New Jersey, and Reed agreed to settle the charges by agreeing to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Tumer also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The SEC alleges that Tumer used his phone to send a message to Gist, telling him that he would have \"bad character\" if he had taken the car. The complaint alleges that the three men then stole Gist\u2019s car and drove down a nearby dirt road, where they met Gist at gunpoint. Gist was later found to have been carjacked and taken to the hospital, where he died of his injuries.  The SEC also alleges that Scott and Reed conspired to steal Gist's car.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Tumer.  Tumer has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $2,500 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Reed has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 587 (11th Cir. 2014).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, and the New Jersey State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
