  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that, on March 7, 2013, defendant CODY DARUS FRENCH, a Texas resident, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Appellant was charged by the trial court with violating the jury-unanimous provision of the federal securities laws, which requires that a jury be unanimous in its determination of whether a defendant has committed a serious felony.  In its judgment, the court found that Appelant violated the juror-monstrator rule, and that the jury had the right to determine whether to convict him based on the evidence presented at trial.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Appeland consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Appelland agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in any future solicitation of the purchase, sale, offer, or offer of any securities in connection with the sale, purchase, offer of, or sale of any security, other than to provide for the purchase of a home and a car.  On May 9, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the United States Court of Appeals for the Southern District of New York issued an order appointing a receiver over the receiver of the receiver.  Sansone agreed to the appointment of a receiver under the receiver and to the payment of a $100,000 civil penalty. The receiver also agreed to be barred from associating with any third-party broker or investment adviser.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation of this matter was conducted by Michael J. McCluskey and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Department of Criminal Investigation in this matter."
