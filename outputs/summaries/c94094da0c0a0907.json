  "summary": "On January 10, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a former fleet service clerk for American Airlines who was found not disabled.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Joanne F. Berryhill, 59, of Chicago, worked steadily from 1982 through 2011 as a custodial clerk for the Chicago public schools, and that she had accumulated over 600 pages of medical evidence.  According to the complaint, Berryhill claimed that she became disabled as of December 22, 2010, due to post traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal tendencies, diabetes, hypertension, and a stroke.  Berryhill's claims were supported by the medical record, but the complaint alleges that Berryhill failed to consider the medical evidence and failed to apply for a remand.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Berryhill.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, Berry Hill consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Brooklyn, N.Y., charging Berryhill with violations of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206-821 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the return of the defendant's civil money.  On January 11, 2019 the SEC issued an order suspending Berryhill from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering her to surrender her passport and be enjoined from future securities law violations.  A hearing for Berryhill on January 13, 2019 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. EST.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Schloesser and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John R. Donahue. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the FBI, the IRS"
