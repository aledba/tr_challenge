  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Nijee Anderson, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to ten years in prison for two counts of robbery by sudden snatching (S.E.2d) and one count of simple battery (Counts 4 and 5).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 16, 2016, Anderson was arrested for the simple battery and simple battery offenses in October 2016.  The SEC alleges that Anderson was the aggressor, and that he was the only one who had ever been convicted of a simple battery charge.  In a parallel criminal case, the SEC charged Alfredo Monselvo and Victor Aliaz, both of whom were also convicted of similar felony charges.  According the complaint, Anderson immediately took a bottle of  methamphetamine and used a syringe to inject the substance.  On the morning of the alleged robbery, the complaint alleges that Monselov and Aliaz went inside the gas station to put air in a tire and Anderson confronted them and demanded money from them. The complaint further alleges that, during the attack, Anderson took a pair of car keys out of the victim\u2019s pocket and held them in his hand, which he then used to kick Monselo out of his car.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, the two victims were confronted by a cashier who confronted Anderson and asked him to return the car keys. The officer agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Anderson from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Anderson to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Scott A. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Dunn. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Georgia Department of Criminal Justice."
