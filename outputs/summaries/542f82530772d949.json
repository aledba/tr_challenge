  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against five prison officials in their official and individual capacities for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that, on August 7, 2015, Thomas, Villalpando, and Brown unlawfully restrained and restrained a prisoner at the Okeechobee Correctional Institution in Florida. According to the complaint, the prison officials used a modified \"take-down\" technique on Sears, which involved placing their arms under his and lifting him to the ground, causing him excruciating pain in his injured shoulders. The complaint further alleges that Thomas and Villalppando followed Sears into the room and began to choke him, causing Sears to hit his head on the door. The SEC alleges that neither Thomas nor Villalappando knew that Sears was at a significant risk of serious harm or that they delayed or denied his access to medical care for those needs. Sears also allegedly told Thomas that he was arbitrarily arrested by prison officials on January 13, 2016, in retaliation for grievances he had filed against her. Sears allegedly also allegedly claimed that Thomas had no visible injuries and that he had no contact with Thomas, Quinones, or Brown after the January 2016 incident. The court's order against Sears, the SEC alleges, is based on the facts and reasonable inferences that Sears made in his sworn statements. Sears consented, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and requires him to surrender his passport. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0report.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint to the SEC\u00c2\u00a0on the subject of this matter, including\u00c2\u00a0On the SEC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0Advisers to Investors in Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0institutions investors not to invest in any investment in any business with\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0advisory\u00c2\u00a0director of\u00c2\u00a0securities\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0FINRA\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2"
