  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by Maureen McDaid, a resident of the Condominium Association for Aztec West Condominium in Hackensack, N.J.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed in federal court in New Jersey on October 14, 2010, McDaid alleged that she entered the building's elevator and entered it unexpectedly and closed on her. The complaint alleges that as she exited the elevator, the elevator doors closed prematurely, striking her and knocking her to the ground. As alleged, as she fell face forward, the doors opened and closed again, severing her spinal cord.  The complaint further alleges that McDaid was not on notice of the malfunctioning elevator doors and that she did not make a prima facie case of negligence.  McDaid also alleges that Preferred Management, Inc., the association's management company, and Bergen Hydraulic Elevator, the company's property manager, failed to offer proof that the elevator's malfunction was unrelated to negligent maintenance.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC charged Preferred Management with violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 10b2-1 and 13a-11 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against McDaid and Preferred Management.  On November 5, 2017, the U.N. District Judge in Manhattan entered a judgment against the defendants, ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, ordering them to disgorge $1,500, and ordering Preferred Management to pay $5,000 in disgorgment and prejudgment interests.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Office of Financial Regulation."
