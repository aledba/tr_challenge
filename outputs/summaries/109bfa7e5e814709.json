  "summary": "On January 13, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York granted a temporary restraining order and ordered the filing of a final judgment against a defendant in a separate bankruptcy proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, on September 6, 2016, Christopher W. Wenegieme filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in the Bankruptcy Court.  According to the complaint, the defendant failed to make timely payments to the trustee's office and failed to pay one payment to that trustee.  In a parallel action, the United States Trustee (\u201cTrustee\u201d) filed a similar action in January 2017 against Creditor Goldstein Group Holding Holding, Inc., a New York-based company that held a mortgage encumbering the property.  On January 12, 2017 Judge Grossman granted the Trustee's request for a preliminary injunction, which prohibits the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000 and a $500,000 civil penalty, respectively. The court also issued an order requiring the defendants to submit a brief in support of their motion to dismiss the case, which was also denied by the court on January 13.  As set forth in the order, the court found that the defendants violated Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20 thereunder, and that the parties violated Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(B)(5)(B).  The court granted the defendants' requests for a permanent injunction, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the assets of the defendants, and a conduct-based injunction against further violations of Section 1307(c).  In addition, the Court granted the parties' request for an expedited hearing on the merits of their claims against the defendants.  Finally, on March 3, 2017 the court issued a final order granting the defendants an emergency asset freeze and ordering them to comply with the court's order that they cease and desist from making false and misleading statements in their bankruptcy filings, and to pay civil penalties of up to $100,000.  A hearing scheduled for April 27, 2017 is scheduled for 9:30 a.m."
