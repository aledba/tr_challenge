  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on February 7, 2017 entered a final agency order that permanently restrains and enjoins former public school basketball coach Javier Cuenca from forfeiting his rights and benefits under the Florida Retirement System Investment Plan.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami-Dade County, Florida, alleges that, on October 4, 2016, the Florida Secretary of State's Office (DOAH) issued an order finding that, pursuant to Section 112.3173(2)(e) of the Florida Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (FLORIDA) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, that Cuenc\u00c3\u00a9 had a duty to the public to safeguard students, and that he exercised a position of authority over these students.  According to the complaint, after four of Cuenci\u00c3\u00a9' basketball players alleged that he had sexually harassed and/or assaulted them, he was charged in four separate cases with lewd and lascivious molestation on a child twelve years of age or older but less than sixteen years of old.  Cuencu allegedly used a set of keys issued to him by the city to access the school's wastewater pump stations; he asked D.F. to show him his penis under the guise of checking for what he called a \"virgin line\"; a subsequent investigation revealed that he entered into the negotiated plea to resolve the pending criminal charges.  In a parallel action, the Department of Health, Bd. of Health and the Miami Regional Office (MDOH) today announced that it has obtained an emergency asset freeze and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the asset freeze.  On February 8, 2017, the SEC issued a final order ordering the forfeiture of all assets in the Florida Department of Education's General Employment Retirement Fund (GERSF) Investment Plan (FRSF).  The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the assets forfeited to the relief fund.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the DOH has agreed to a permanent injunction and to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining the forfeiture from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordering the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar from serving as an officer or director of a public school.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Scott A. Basinger of the Fort Lauderdale Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0"
