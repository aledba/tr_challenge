  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that defendant Jesus Carlos Tena-Arana, a Mexican citizen who was previously removed from the United States four times, improperly sought a downward variance in sentencing based on an appellate waiver.  According to the complaint, the district court refused to consider the appellate waiver because, as alleged, it was inconsistent with the federal sentencing guidelines.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court did not consider a contemporaneous objection to a defendant\u2019s waiver of appellate rights because, in reality, the defendant did not object at sentencing because he had been convicted of a serious felony and had a good relationship with his son and ex-wife.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Tena Arana has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and imposes a $25,000 officer-and-director bar against him.  He has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a federal securities law.  On May 9, 2017, the District Court in Denver issued an order imposing a 30-month prison sentence, followed by three years of supervised release, on a motion for a variant sentence based on a previously issued suspension of his sentence.  As alleged in the Complaint:  The District Court issued an Order imposing a temporary restraining order against TenaArana and ordering him to comply with the court's order.   The court also issued a Notice of Commencement on May 24, 2010, which included a reference to the fact that it had not previously issued a suspension of the suspension.  It also ordered the court to consider a recommendation for a reduction in the amount of a penalty to be determined by the court at a later date.  Finally, the court issued a Final Order suspending the suspension pending final determination by the Court on the merits of the case. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David A. Cohen and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Denver Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Office of Criminal Investigations, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado Department of Criminal Justice."
