  "summary": "On July 3, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against Steven H. Hall, a former employee of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Office of Workers' Compensation (OWCP), finding that he was entitled to compensation based on his \"due process\" challenge.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., Hall was assigned to work as an administrative assistant at a construction site where he suffered a respiratory illness.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of his work at the site, Hall was deprived of the right to a hearing and to respond to a decision by OWCP in June 2013 that permanently restrains his benefits.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hall consented to the entry of the final judgment, which enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $30,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hall.   The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint against Hall, filed under seal in federal court in New York, charges him with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-1 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-director and penny stock bars against him.  To learn more about administrative review, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-2055 (Feb. 24, 2014).  The Complaint also charges the Secretary of Labor with violating Section 15(b)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 15a-14 and Rule 15b2-2 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, a conduct-based injunctive relief, and an officer and director bar against Hall from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the securities industry.
