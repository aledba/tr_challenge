  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of South Carolina today entered a final judgment against the Hilton Head Island-Bluffton Chamber of Commerce, which is subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) due to its receipt and expenditure of certain funds designated for promoting tourism, which we will refer to collectively as accommodation tax funds. The court found that the Chamber's receipt of these funds renders it a public body under FOIA, thus subjecting the Chamber to all of the FOIA's requirements.  The court also found that, as alleged in the complaint, the Chamber violated the reporting and reporting provisions of the A-Tax statute and Proviso 39.2 of the Appropriation Act of 1940.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against Domains.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charleston, South Carolina, the U. S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York today filed criminal charges in connection with Domains' alleged violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, Domains consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and a $20,000 officer and director bar. The judgment also orders Domains to comply with the entry and payment of a $50,000 bar.  Domains has agreed to a $75,000 penalty and to pay $10.95, which will be offset by the amount of his civil penalty, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public organization for the rest of his or her life. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Sparks and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Sparks. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The Commission on Audit and Rulemaking has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, and the FBI in this matter."
