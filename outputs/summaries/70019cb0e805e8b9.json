  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Natchitoches, Louisiana mother for her role in an alleged child abuse scheme.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Louisiana, J.D., a nine-year-old boy, was placed in the care of his adoptive mother, F.D.-H., because she was unable or unwilling to provide any assistance in the child's development. According to a complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Louisiana, the mother told her son that she was going under tables in the cafeteria looking under dresses of women. The complaint further alleges that she did not make any financial contributions to the child, despite repeated requests from her to do so.  The complaint alleges that the mother continued to withhold funds from her son and instead used the money for her own benefit.  In a letter to her son, J.-H. allegedly told her that he wanted to suck other men's privates.  She also allegedly told him that he had told her he had had sex with a boy in his foster home.  J-D. allegedly replied that he did not want to have sex with another man, and that he would rather live with his mother.  As alleged in the complaint, the state's complaint charges the mother with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a $20,000 civil penalty, and orders her return to the custody of her husband. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services, and the Louisiana State Department of Health and Human Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigation\u00c2\u00a0to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to determine whether to terminate the parental rights of a child in need of a permanent home.\u00c2\u00a0On May 18, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the mother and father of the child in connection with the alleged scheme. The case is being supervised by Jan Folena, Chief of the Office of the Inspector General."
