  "summary": "On January 18, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana entered a final judgment against Debtor, Jr., a former codebtor in his wife's Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  The court found that Debtor violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, Debtor filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in 2002 without filing a bankruptcy plan and failed to timely file with the court a copy of his bankruptcy plan.  Debtor's bankruptcy petition was filed on schedule H, and the court granted relief and barred him from refiling for five (5) years.  In its order, the court also barred Debtor from participating in a credit counseling program and from filing a new bankruptcy case.  As alleged in the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans on June 27, 2018, Debt filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 under the terms of the Exchange Act, which prohibits the filing of bankruptcy petitions for periods of time exceeding 180 days.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint Debtor has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws, requires him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of one (1) year.  Additionally, the Court has ordered Debtor to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000 and a $500,000 civil penalty, both of which will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit and supervised by Marc Blau of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission (FINRA), and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  The case is being supervised by Chedly L. Dumornay, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, with assistance from Joseph G. Sansone, Regional Director of the Market Abuse Unit, and Senior Trial Counsel Robert A. Kasper."
