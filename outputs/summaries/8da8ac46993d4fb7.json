  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against a Buffalo, New York-area roofer who was found unable to perform work due to severe back pain.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, N.Y. on February 18, 2015, alleges that defendant David M. Rafiy, M.D., of Premier Care Levittown, was not disabled when he was first diagnosed with the condition on January 17, 2012.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that, prior to the alleged onset of his disability, plaintiff had suffered severe back and neck pain, had difficulty standing, and had difficulty using his right arm.  In addition, the SEC alleges that plaintiff had a history of diabetes and hypertension, and that he had had hip and shoulder surgery.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, plaintiff was unable to work because of the severity of his back pain, and could not stand for long periods of time.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Rafiy consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Additionally, he will be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to apply for, and purchase, a security deposit, a home, a car, or any other security that may be required to secure the security of such a security.  Separately, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Rafiy.  On March 24, 2016, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the U.N. Office of Health and Human Services issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an order suspending or issuing a temporary restraining order against the receiver, ordering him to surrender his passport, and appointing an officer and director of the receiver to the receiver.  At a hearing on March 26, 2017, Judge Sansone granted the receiver's request for an asset freeze and ordered him to provide a copy of the court's order, which was later obtained by the SEC.   The court also issued a subpoena for the receiver"
