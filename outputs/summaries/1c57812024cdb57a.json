  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against TMZ, Inc., a now-defunct Texas-based entertainment website, and its owner, Robert Jones, for defrauding investors by falsely claiming that Jones was the primary source of a purported hitman to kill his agent.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas on June 18, 2014, Jones allegedly told a co-worker that he was going to hire a hit man to take out his agent, telling him that the hitman was a \"gangster\" who threatened to \"disappear\" from his employer.  The complaint alleges that Jones replied, \"I'm afraid for my life because of this.\"  As alleged in the complaint, however, that Jones did not hire the hit man, and instead used an alias to conceal his identity.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Jones, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Jones consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000.  Jones also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Fort Worth Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Dallas Police Department, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Texas Securities and Exchange Commission in this matter."
