  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered final judgments against two Idaho-based individuals for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that John and Jane Doe were placed in the care of the Utah Department of Health and Welfare, which administers the agency's Child Protection Central Registry.  According to the complaint, the defendants agreed to be terminated without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  To learn more about child termination, see the\u00c2\u00a0Investigations\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0Adoption.gov\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0Definitions\u00c2\u00a0of Child Termination.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General\u00c2\u00a0has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint\u00c2\u00a0to encourage parents to check the backgrounds of their children by using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0assessment tool to identify whether their children are particularly vulnerable and out-of-control. \u00c2\u00a0Among other things, the SEC alleges that the defendants failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims that termination was in the best interest of the children.

The complaint further alleges that, during his time at the Utah facility, the Does were unable to discharge their parental responsibilities because of a lack of support from a licensed agency.  As a result of their inability to discharge parental responsibilities, Jane Doe was placed in foster care for the remainder of her life, and John Doe, who was a college professor at the time of the alleged incident, was placed with the Department of Social Services, where he was placed under the supervision of a social worker.  Jane Doe, however, completed schooling to be an academic professional, and was not permitted to participate in the social work that led to her decision to terminate her parental rights.  Finally, the complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 16-2005(1)(d) and (3) and 16-2007(4) and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.
