  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Sara Lee Corp., a Texas-based energy drink manufacturer, and its co-defendant, Jacked Up, LLC, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from September 2011 through November 2011, Sara Lee and Jackedup raised the issue of whether or not the Sara Lee Pro Forma could be relied upon as a basis for calculating lost profits.  According to the complaint, Janik, in making his calculations, made a number of assumptions that were unsupported by the facts at hand, including that Sara Lee would pay $25.41 per kilogram for its energized tea, coffee, and cappuccino products and that JackedUp would use a \"max scenario\" to achieve its projected 50 percent penetration ratio.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Janik's estimates of lost profits were based on his own research, which he did not consider when making his calculation.  As a result, the SEC's order against SaraLee and JackEDUp, which was entered into on November 7, 2011, permanently enjoins Sara Lee from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Sara Lee to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.5 million, and ordering SaraLee to pay a $20,000 civil penalty.  Additionally, the court granted Sara Lee's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the company to provide an accounting of its lost profits and to pay an officer and director bar in the event of a default judgment by the court.  Sara Lee has agreed to a settlement where she will be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions, with the right to reapply after five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Texas Department of Securities and Exchange Commission in this matter."
