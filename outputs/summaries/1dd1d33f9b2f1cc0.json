  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against Jaclyn Tahboub, a Virginia resident who was diagnosed with an incompetent cervix during her first pregnancy.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia on December 22, 2016, Jaclyn reported severe pain and pain in her abdomen, legs, and lower back, which she had not experienced since her 2011 cerclage procedure.  The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to properly designate her expert witnesses and failed to adequately identify the cause of the pain and the possible effect of the infection on her health.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(3) of Exchange Act Rules 10b2-1 and 17a-3 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Shareef has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Shareef also agreed to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged violations of the securities laws.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Shareef.
