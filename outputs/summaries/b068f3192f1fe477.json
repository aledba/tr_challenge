  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment in favor of the Thompson defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to timely raise the issue of whether the court had jurisdiction over the case.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in 2014, the trial court granted the defendants' motion for leave to amend the complaint without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  As the complaint further alleges, the court did not determine whether the defendants had a duty to object to the amendment of the complaint and, instead, to grant the defendants a temporary restraining order preventing the defendants from raising the issue again.  On August 2, 2019, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan entered a judgment against the defendants that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $10,000.   The court's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, orders the defendants to comply with the court's order, and requires them to show cause and effect, including whether they have waived their right to a preliminary injunction, to hold a hearing, to determine whether to issue a judgment, to issue an order appointing a receiver, and to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver.
