  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action in federal court against the Attorney General of Massachusetts for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Boston, Massachusetts, alleges that, in violation of the federal securities laws, the United States Postal Inspection Service (PIS) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued false and misleading statements in connection with a series of \"exchange visitor\" programs designed to promote international cultural exchange. The complaint alleges that the federal government intended to preempt a specific field of the exchange program by requiring that all au pair participants receive a certain amount of weekly compensation. In reality, the complaint alleges, the federal laws do not preempt the relevant field. Rather, they require that the au pair participant be compensated at a rate that is consistent with the federal wage and hour requirements, and that the host family is not required to comply with those requirements. In addition, the defendants contend that the state laws that govern the Au Pair Program are not consistent with federal law, and therefore they are barred from enforcing those state laws directly against their employer.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Economic and Risk Analysis (OIEA) today issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint to the Office of Compliance with the Exchange Program. The Office's Complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FINCA) in this matter.
