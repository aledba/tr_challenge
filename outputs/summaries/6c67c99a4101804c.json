  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on May 15, 2019, entered a final judgment in favor of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation against Todd Barton Schuster, finding that Schuster violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, California, alleges that, in 2016, Schuster was released from prison and was eligible for early parole consideration under the federal securities laws.  Schuster filed a petition in the federal court for a writ of habeas corpus, which is a temporary restraining order that prohibits certain federal law enforcement agencies from issuing or enforcing the securities laws, including the SEC's.  In a parallel action, the California Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued an order suspending Schuster from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the securities, including securities in the securities of publicly-traded companies.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the court granted Schuster and the SEC the right to return to the United States and seek a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against Schuster.  On May 17, 2018, a federal district court in San Diego entered a judgment ordering the SEC to comply with the court's order, ordering Schuster to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $2,500.  Additionally, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action on May 24, 2018 against the SEC, charging Schuster with violating Section 15 of the Exchange Act, Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and aiding and abetting Schuster\u2019s violations of Section 15 and Rule 15a-4 thereunder of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers Act).  The court also ordered Schuster be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and ordered him to submit to the SEC a copy of the final regulations that were issued by the SEC in May 2018.
