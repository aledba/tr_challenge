  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the agency.  The SEC's complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its order, the court also entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants' assets, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  According to the SEC's order, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, the defendants failed to show sufficient evidence to determine whether the project was exempt under the exemption for normal operations of public gathering facilities.  As alleged in the complaint, the Defendants failed to demonstrate that the project posed a significant environmental threat to the environment, and failed to consider the unusual circumstances of the project.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins Defendants from violating these provisions and orders Defendants to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the appointment of a receiver to determine the amount of relief that will be imposed upon Defendants in the future.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Environmental Quality, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
