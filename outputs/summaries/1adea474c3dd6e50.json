  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against California resident Donald A. Norberg for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Monterey, California, charges Norberg with violating the pre-judgment provision of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Norberg, as a successful party, filed a writ of mandamus in March 2013, which imposed a temporary restraining order on the issuance of a final environmental impact report (EIR) and the approval of a dam and reservoir project.  In its judgment, the court found that the Commission had exceeded its jurisdiction in imposing condition No. 2, and that Norberg was not entitled to an attorney general's fee because he had no intention of selling his property.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, and orders Norberg to pay a civil penalty of $35,870.  Norberg also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to pay an officer-and-director bar in the amount of $250,000.  As a result of the court's order, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17.  This case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Department of Insurance in this matter."
