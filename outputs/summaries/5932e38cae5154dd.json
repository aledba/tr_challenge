  "summary": "The Rock Island County District Attorney's Office announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against First Financial Group, L.C. and its owner, Richard I. Vesole, alleging that First Financial violated the antifraud provisions of Section 15-175 of the Property Tax Code.  According to the SEC's complaint, First Financial and First Financial agreed to pay $3,214.44 in pre-judgment interest and a penalty of perjury to determine whether plaintiffs were entitled to the general homestead exemption.  The complaint also alleges that the defendants failed to disclose to the assessor that the property owner and lessee were liable for the 2015 real property taxes and that the lessee had to pay the real estate taxes out of First Financial's own funds.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants did not directly pay the county collector for the property taxes because they were not equitable owners of the property.  First Financial also allegedly failed to record any real estate tax payments to First Financial.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants' lease agreement did not require plaintiffs to make any payments to the county, but instead passed the cost of taxes and insurance onto plaintiffs as additional rent to be paid.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders First Financial to pay a civil penalty of $2,500. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Department for the Northern District of Illinois, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Illinois Department of Banking and Securities."
