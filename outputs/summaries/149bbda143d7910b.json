  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against Joyce Moore, a Kansas resident accused of acting as an unregistered broker in two estate sales.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, Missouri, on September 9, 2015, Joyce Moore and her husband, John W. Moore, raised the issue of undue influence in contracts between John and Joyce Moore. The complaint alleges that in preparing and presenting the contracts, Steven and Joyce repeatedly told the jury that they had the capacity to enter into the contracts without undue influence, and that they should not be required to prove that undue influence was not present in the contracts. Instead, the complaint alleges, the court improperly instructed the jury to show that the contracts were not subject to undue influence and that the parties had no capacity to sell the farmland to Jebediah. The court ultimately agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is subject to approval by the court.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Scott L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kansas Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson, Ms. Bort, and Mr. Cersovsky.

Welshhans, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
