  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania-based fraternity house and its owner in a case that was investigated by the Pennsylvania Department of Housing and Urban Development.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that, on July 18, 2017, Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) revoked the status of Alpha Chi Rho, Inc., a fraternity house located in State College, Pennsylvania.  According to the complaint, the fraternity house was not recognized by Penn State and, instead, was used as a rooming house by undergraduate members of the fraternity.  In addition, the complaint alleges that when the Penn State Board of Trustees issued a notice of violation in July 2017, the property was occupied by a group of students, some of whom were students at the university at the time.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the books and records and records provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, LLC (\"Advisers\"), and the broker-dealer registration provision of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 206(3) and Rule 15a-4 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of up to $1,000,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  On November 19, 2018, the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia granted the Defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the securities laws and issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the operation of the alleged violations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United States Postal Inspection Service and the Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General."
