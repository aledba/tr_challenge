  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on January 9, 2018, a Covington, Louisiana man and his wife, Ronald St. Cyre, entered into a guilty plea by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  According to the complaint, the defendant's wife, Chelsea, drove him to the office on crutches and asked him to check the vehicle. The complaint alleges that the defendant replied, \"for safety, because he was in fear of his life.\"  The court also found that, contrary to the defendants' representations to the court, he did not have sufficient evidence to show that he had engaged in a gun-related crime.  In addition, the court found that the defendants had not engaged in any criminal activity, and the defendant had not committed a felony.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar prohibiting them from conducting any conduct that constitutes a reasonable suspicion of a criminal act, including a search of a motor vehicle.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Mascianica of the New Orleans District Court granted the motion for summary judgment against the defendant and ordered him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the court.   The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Safety and Corrections Division. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Louisiana Department of Banking and Securities, the FBI's Criminal Investigations Division, the Internal Revenue Service's Office of Inspector General, the United States Postal Inspection Service's Criminal Justice Inspections and Examinations Task Force, the Department of Homeland Security's Cyber Unit, the Federal Office of Financial Regulation, the Office of the Inspector General's Retail Strategy Task Force and the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Louisiana. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms."
