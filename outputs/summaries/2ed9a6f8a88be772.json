  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered final judgments against Kyco Services, LLC and ITY of Texas, LLC in an administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that, in 2010, Kyco contracted with ITY, LLC for the purpose of providing drywall services on construction projects.  According to the complaint, ITY provided workers to Kyco, provided supervision for those workers, and provided payroll for the workers paid by ITY.  In addition, the complaint alleges that ITY employed contract laborers for Kyco during certain pay periods in 2014 and 2015.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the Defendants agreed to the Defendants' entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Kyco also agreed to be barred from appearing before the Commission as a witness in any administrative proceeding, and to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The Defendants also agreed not to violate the parol evidence rule, which requires a court to determine whether a defendant is entitled to a penny-per-share of any compensation paid to him or her in a civil proceeding, such as a court order requiring him to show cause and effect of his or her receipt of a penny.  Finally, the defendants agreed to settle the case by agreeing to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay civil penalties, and requires them to provide a copy of the final judgment to the Commission.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On January 15, 2014, the Utah Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order halting the Defendants from further violating the federal laws, ordering Kyco to comply with the Commission's order, and ordering ITY to pay an $80,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Scott A. Mascianica of the Salt Lake Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Department of Workforce Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Utah Office of Inspector General in this matter."
