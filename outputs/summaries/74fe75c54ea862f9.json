  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia today entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of a Virginia man who died in a 2011 automobile accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that Debra Shumate, a widow of William Earl Thompson, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC also charged Thompson with violating the pre-judgment provision of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on October 18, 2011 in the United States Court of Appeals for the Southern District of New York, the SEC agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins the estate from violating the rule and orders it to pay $500,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Washington today announced criminal charges against Shumates.  On November 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge William G. Donnelly of the United Kingdom entered a judgment against the estate, ordering it to disgorge $197,157.50 in medical expenses, and ordering the estate to pay a civil penalty of $250,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s findings, the estate consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the settlement to be subject to court approval, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 6209 (1923).  The Commission on Compensation and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Virginia State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Virginia Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
