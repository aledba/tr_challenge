  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Lourdes Margarita Garcia, a South Florida resident convicted of defrauding the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by filing false tax returns in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, Florida, alleges that Garcia failed to adequately disclose to the jury that she and her husband, Angel Garcia, were involved in a fraudulent scheme to defraud the IRS.  According to the complaint, Garcia was not a party to the scheme, but rather a participant in the scheme.  In addition, the complaint alleges that she was not present during the trial, and that Garcia did not participate in the preparation of the tax returns.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Garcia consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay disgorgement of $137,928.74 plus prejudgment interest of $1,561,854.19, and orders Garcia to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Garcia also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney and to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any tax return for a specified period of time, and requires her to provide a copy of the IRS' tax returns to the court in order to determine whether to issue an order appointing a receiver for the receiver.  Finally, the court entered a judgment against Garcia that permanently restrains her from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains, and ordering a conduct-based injunction prohibiting her from appearing, practicing, or practicing in the public square before the SEC as a \"judgment representative.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Garcia arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  Among other things, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against Garcia, as well as the return of her passport, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against Garcia.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Mascianica of the SEC issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering Garcia to comply with the court's order.  A hearing is scheduled for June 13, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13"
