  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Drew Gainor and Seat Scouts LLC, two ticket brokers, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that, from at least May 2016 through at least January 2017, Gainor created a web application called AutoPricer to help brokers price tickets in secondary markets for sporting events, concerts, and theater performances.  According to the complaint, as a result of this, Autopricer was not developed in the industry prior to Gainor's acquisition of Seat Scouts.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Gainor used the knowledge and experience Gainor provided him to develop the auto-uploader.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, that, contrary to what Gainor told the court, he did not use the knowledge, experience, or expertise he gained while working as a ticket broker to develop this product.  Rather, he used the information he learned while developing the auto piggyback product, which he called \"Primitive Pricing,\" to price and monitor tickets in the secondary market.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On May 26, 2017, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Gainor, Seat Scouts, and other defendants, and granted a preliminary injunction against all of the defendants, ordering Gainor to comply with the court order, and ordering Seat Scouts to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.   The court also granted the defendants' motion for preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-Cv-2099, June 21, 2017.  Separately, the SEC announced that it had obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of all defendants, barring Gainor from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged violations of the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers\") and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against further violations"
