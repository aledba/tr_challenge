  "summary": "On August 30, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky entered final judgments in favor of Kentucky's right-to-work law, which prohibits the imposition of any federal or state law, including the right to collective bargaining.  The court's order, which was entered on a temporary basis, permanently enjoins Kentucky from violating the federal and state constitutions, as well as the antifraud provisions of Sections 13(a)(3) and 14(b) of the Kentucky Constitution, and orders the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office to file an emergency action to halt the implementation of the law.  In its order, the court also issued an order requiring Kentucky to comply with the federal, state, and local laws.  According to the order, this action violated Sections 13a-14, 13b-5, and 13b2-3 of the federal securities laws, and the \"duty of fair representation\" provisions of Section 14(a) and 13(b)(2)(A)(3).  The Court's order also prohibits Kentucky from imposing a penny stock bar on certain members of the public, and prohibits the issuance of an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Kentucky secretary of state's office and attorney general have consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating these provisions. The court also ordered Kentucky to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $50,000.  On August 31, 2018 the court issued an emergency order suspending the suspension of the suspension pending final judgments against Kentucky's secretary of State, Attorney General, Secretary of Commerce, and Secretary of the Department of Justice. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Robert M. Kelly and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Kelly. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The Commission on Economic and Risk Analysis has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Kentucky Department of Commerce in this matter."
