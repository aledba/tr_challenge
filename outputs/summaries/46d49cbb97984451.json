  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against Riddell & Co., Inc. and its associated entities for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, alleges that, from at least 1972 through the late 1990s, defendants made material misrepresentations about the risks and causes of long-term brain injuries that resulted from repeated head injuries.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose to the court that their injuries were progressive and latent and that they were wrongfully caused.  According to the complaint, the defendants also failed to inform the players of their injuries and failed to file a claim for compensation for the injuries that they now seek.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, defendants violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") and Rule 5d-8 thereunder, and that defendants violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(c)(3)(B)(3) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder of the federal securities laws. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC complaint, defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the securities laws, order them to pay civil penalties, and impose injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the United States District Court in Chicago issued a temporary restraining order halting the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million, and imposing a $500,000 civil penalty. The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a class action proceeding.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2018 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern time.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.
