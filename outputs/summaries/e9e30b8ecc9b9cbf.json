  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against a Connecticut man who was convicted of two counts of sexual assault in the first degree.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Stamford, Connecticut, alleges that, from at least 2010 through 2011, defendant Richard P. Silverstein, of Stamford, Conn., engaged in a pattern of sexually aggressive conduct with his three children, G and K. According to the complaint, the defendant began abusing the children at a young age and engaged in additional types of sexual misconduct with the children. The complaint further alleges that the defendant used a rag-covered finger into the victim's vagina while bathing her and using a belt to engage in oral sex. The SEC alleges that when the defendant left the family home in 2007, he began to molest the children, who were then under the age of 12, and continued to do so until they were 12. The court also found that, in addition to the alleged physical abuse, the defendants engaged in other misconduct in the home, including, but not limited to, physical abuse. In addition, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the jury was entitled to determine whether the defendants were substantially prejudiced by their delay in disclosing the alleged misconduct.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Silverstein.  On January 12, 2015, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Connecticut Court of Appeals issued an order suspending Silverstein from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The order also temporarily enjoins him from participating in any future SEC proceedings, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Silverstein consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge $1,078 in ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing on February 4, 2015 will be conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Amy S. Cotter. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Kasper and Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Braunstein.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Connecticut Attorney General's Office, and the Connecticut Department of Health and Human Services."
