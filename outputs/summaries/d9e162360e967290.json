  "summary": "On February 11, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Bradley Arant Boult Cummings, a Birmingham, Alabama attorney, for violating the antifraud provisions of Rule 1.7(a) of the federal securities laws.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Bradley from representing another attorney in a pending litigation action.  According to the court's order, filed on December 23, 2018, Bradley represented Southern Visions, Inc., a now-defunct Georgia-based law firm, in a civil action brought by Red Diamond, alleging that it had violated Rule 10b-5, which requires attorneys to represent clients who are directly or indirectly adverse to a law firm's conduct.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Bradley.    The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, charges Bradley with violating Rule 13b2-1, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Bradley consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Rule 12b-20, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Bradley also agreed to be barred from representing any attorney who has a conflict of interest, including by virtue of having been counsel to a client in a prior litigation action, and to pay an officer and director bar in the future.  Finally, Bradley agreed to settle the civil action by consenting to a judgment ordering him to be permanently enjoined from associating with any law firm that does not comply with the federal rules of professional conduct, including, without limitation, with the attorney representing the client at the time of his or her representation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay of the Market Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Attorney General's Office, and the Alabama Secretary of State's Office in this matter.
