  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against defendant Jeffery M. Moyer, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, Missouri, alleges that, while serving as counsel for Moyer's trial, Moyer failed to establish that he had a conflict of interest when, in fact, he had no conflicts of interest at all.  According to the complaint, in addition to failing to establish a reasonable likelihood that J.T. would be able to testify at a criminal trial, the SEC also found that Moyer was not qualified as a defense counsel because he had failed to adequately represent the facts of the case to the court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Missouri today announced criminal charges against Moyer.  On January 11, 2010, the Honorable Judge Glenn R.

Finally, the court found that, at the beginning of the trial, M.T.'s testimony was inconsistent with his performance, and that he did not have a reasonable probability that she would be available to testify in the criminal case.  As a result, the jury was not able to determine whether Moyer had a reasonable chance of being able to participate in a fair trial, and the court did not deem it necessary to impose a penalty against him.  Instead, it found that the jury could not determine whether Mason had a duty to protect the interests of the jury by requiring him to show \"reasonable likelihood\" that he was competent to represent the jury at a trial.  Additionally, the Court found that Mason's performance was deficient because he was being paid by the SEC to represent both Moyer and JT. in an off-grid criminal case and that the SEC required him to provide corroborating evidence to the jury.   The court also ruled that, in the alternative, Mason could not participate in the trial by"
