  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment against San Jose, California-based technology company Technology Credit Corporation (TCC) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, TCC and its co-founders, James E. Hartigan and Jeong Ha Shinn, raised the issue of whether to transfer the case to a federal district court in New Jersey.  The complaint alleges that TCC, Hartigan, and Shinn agreed to settle the case by agreeing to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 13(a)(1) and 13(c) of Exchange Act Rule 12b-20, and ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  TCC also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $470,939.46.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced criminal charges against Hartigan.  On January 31, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint against TCC alleging that it violated Exchange Act Rules 13b2-1, 13a2-2, and 13a3-3 thereunder, and that it was liable to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $100,000, respectively.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by David H. Schiff and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Schiff."
