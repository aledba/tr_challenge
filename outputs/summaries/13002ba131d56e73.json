  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a New York City-based community garden founded in 1985.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, on or about January 6, 2014, the Garden was founded by community members who sought to improve their neighborhood through the creation of a community garden.  The complaint alleges that the Garden members, starting in 1985, cleared garbage and debris, pulled weeds, and erected a chain-link fence to enclose the property.  Over the years, the complaint alleges, members of the Garden raised funds to construct a \"pizza garden\" on the property, which was then used by neighborhood children to put on performances.  As alleged in the complaint, over many years the Garden's members took possession and \"by their tremendous efforts\" transformed the property into a vibrant community garden where generations of children have thrived.  In one instance, the court found that defendants and their predecessors abandoned the property as a \"shameful eyesore\" and abandoned it as a result of repeated attempts to retake possession by third parties claiming a right to use and occupy a portion of the property for the requisite period.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $3,350,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On July 5, 2016, the Honorable Deborah A. James of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Manhattan granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment against the defendants."
