  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against defendant Antonio Tillmon, Jr., who was convicted of three felony drug-trafficking charges.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina on March 19, 2015, Tillmon was charged with conspiracy to commit drug trafficking, attempted possession of heroin with intent to distribute, and federal programs bribery.  The SEC alleges that Tillmon conspired with other law enforcement and correctional officers to carry out the scheme.  As alleged in the complaint, he was paid $2,500 to accompany his friend, Ikeisha Jacobs, on three innocent drives to Maryland so that he could, on one occasion, take photographs of the drug transport.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for North Carolina announced criminal charges against Tillmon.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, which was filed on March 21, 2017, the U. S. Attorney's office for the Northern District of New York today announced that it filed a criminal case against Tillon.  On March 24, 2018, the court entered a default judgment against the defendants, ordering Tillmon to pay a civil penalty of 120 months' imprisonment and a $1,500 civil penalty.  Tillmon agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $5,000, plus prejudgment interest of $3,500, and to pay civil penalties of $2.5 million and $2 million, respectively, for each of the three drug trafficking-related charges he has been charged with.   The court also granted Tillmon a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from associating with any third party in connection with a drug trafficking case, and a penny stock bar against him.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 21, 2015).  The Court also denied Tillmon\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on all of the charged charges, ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years, and imposing a five-year conduct-based injunction against him from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  It also ordered him to sign a cease-and-desist order and pay a $10,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  Finally,"
