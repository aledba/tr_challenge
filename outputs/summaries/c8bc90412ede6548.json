  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the Hayses in a civil injunctive action brought by the San Francisco office against them.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of San Francisco, alleges that, in 2010, CSH Theatres, a San Francisco-based theater company, purchased the Curran Theatre in San Francisco. The complaint alleges that CSH and its then-director, Jeffrey Hays, violated Section 7.02(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 7b-5 thereunder, and that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties as directors and managers of the company. The court also found that the Defendants breached their duty to maximize the economic success of the theater by not renewing the lease.  According to the complaint, the defendants also breached their duties to protect the interests of SHN and to avoid conflicts of interest between the parties.  In its judgment, the court held that, based on the evidence presented in the SEC's litigation, the Defendants violated their duty of loyalty and the duty of duty to the theater.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the Honorable Judge Robert E. Curran granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order requiring the defendants to pay disgorgement of $32,219.94 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038.71, a civil penalty of $25,000, and a penny stock bar of $10,000.  Nederlander's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws also seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest from the defendants.  On August 6, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in the Northern District of New York entered a judgment against the defendants that permanently enjoins them from violating Section 7 of the securities laws and orders them to pay civil penalties of $20,000 each. The judgment also prohibits the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) and bars them from serving as officers or directors of any theater, and from participating in the production or promotion of any play. The Court of Chancery also granted the parties' requests for a partial injunction against future violations of Section 9 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against the Defendants for their roles in the alleged violations.
