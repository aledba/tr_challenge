  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced today that it has obtained a temporary restraining order halting a New York-based pharmaceutical company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, New York, alleges that Michael A. Jamail, d/b/a Surrealistic Sensations, an online pharmacy based in Watertown, N.Y., purchased 17 different ethnobotanical products.  According to the complaint, Jamail's products are designer drugs that are promoted as safe for human consumption and then insufficiently labeled.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Jamail falsely claimed that his products were designer pharmaceuticals that could be used in electronic cigarettes with the added benefit of psychoactive and psychoactive effects.  As alleged in the complaint Jamail also failed to disclose the names of the purported pharmaceutical companies he purchased from, the manufacturer or distributor of the products, or the manner in which he will be inconvenienced by a trial in the county where the action was conducted.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  Jamail has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Tannis H. Wiebe, Eric S. Sigurdson and Laurence Y. Katz of the New York office, and the litigation will be led by Eric T. Lundborg-Gray and supervised by Amy S. Cotter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Office of Inspector General and the U.N. Secret Service."
