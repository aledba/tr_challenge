  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania on December 22, 2016, entered a final judgment in a civil injunctive action against BeeMac Trucking, LLC (BeeMac), a third-party logistics provider.  The court found that the no-hire provision in the Motor Carriage Services Contract (MCSC) between PLS and BeeMac violated the antifraud provisions of Section 14.3 of the contract. The court also found that, as a matter of law, this provision violated public policy by preventing PLS from directly or indirectly hiring, hiring, or attempting to induce any employee of PLS or any of its affiliates to leave their employment with PLS. In addition, the court ruled that BeeMac could not establish similar, prior, direct dealings with certain of its customers, and that it could not enforce the \"no-hire\" provision contained in the MCSC. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, charges BeeMac and PLS with violating the anti-fraud provisions. The complaint seeks a preliminary injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, John Rymas, and Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Werner. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce."
