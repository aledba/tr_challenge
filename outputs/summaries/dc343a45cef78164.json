  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Exportadora de Sal, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican salt production corporation 51-percent owned by the Mexican government, and Mitsubishi Corporation, a wholly-owned and controlled corporation, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Mexico City, charges ESSA with violating the federal securities laws and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against ESSA.  According to the SEC's order, the court found that ESSA violated the anti-trust provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and Section\u00c2\u00a010(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 5b2-1, and Rules\u00c2\u00a011a-2, 13a-13, and 13b-14 thereunder, and that the court should determine whether to impose a permanent injunction, impose a civil penalty, and issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the distribution of the salt in the country.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, ESSA consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions, and orders it to comply with the court's order.  Separately, a federal district court in the District of Columbia entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants, ordering them to return to selling their salt to the market, and ordering the issuance of an order requiring them to pay back their back taxes.   The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, or promotion of any oil-related product, including the right to reapply as a public company after five years of serving as an officer and director of a state-owned company. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner, and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mexican Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Mexican Secretary of State's Office and the Mexican Ministry of Economy and Commerce."
