  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Dallas Police Officer Jacob Deloof, who was convicted of aggravated kidnapping in 2012.  The court entered the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the criminal case.  According to the court's order, Deloof and his partner, Justin O'Donnell, were called to the scene of a home invasion on July 1, 2016. They were confronted by a man who described as a \"madman\" who threatened to \"kill\" his mother and father. The court also found that Deloof had a history of domestic violence and that he had been involved in a prior home invasion that left one of his brothers and father seriously injured. Deloof also allegedly told the officer that he was afraid of Armijo, who he believed was a member of the Tango Blast, and that his mother had been shot in the head during the home invasion. The Court also found Deloof liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Deloof to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.

On July 4, 2016, the Court entered a judgment against Deloof ordering him to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations. The order also imposed a $500 civil penalty for Deloof.  At a hearing on July 5, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the Court of Appeals granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the securities laws, ordering Deloof not to violate the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933, and ordering that he pay a civil penalty of $500,000 and a $250,000 penalty.
