  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a fifth-grade girl charged with cyberbullying for sending threatening messages to a 13-year-old boy.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, in the early 2000s, four girls formed a group called \"Snapchat\" to share messages about killing him, his dog, and even his goldfish.  According to the complaint, one of the girls sent the messages to S, who was in the group at the time. The complaint alleges that S replied to the messages by saying that he did not like the way the girls' messages were sent, and that he \"shoved\" the books off of S's desk and told the girls \"what if he doesn't have a dog.\"  The complaint further alleges that the girls did not intend for S to see the messages and did not plan to share them with anyone outside the group.  Instead, the complaint alleges, the girls fantasized about destroying S's dog, stealing his jewelry, and then sending the texts to S's mother, who never actually read them.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,078.95 plus prejudgment interest of $2,077.95 and a civil penalty of $250,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against the fourth and fifth graders involved in the alleged scheme.  On May 24, 2017, the U. S. District Judge in Jackson granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest.  A hearing on May 26, 2018, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Department of Securities and Exchange Commission. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investigational\u00c2\u00a0assessment tool.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of any investment in\u00c2\u00a0institutions\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0may be\u00c2\u00a0conducting\u00c2\u00a0before\u00c2\u00a0judgment"
