  "summary": "On May 17, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against a defendant who claimed that he failed to provide for the maintenance and support of a child's birth.  According to the court's order, on October 19, 2017, Step-Father filed a Petition for Adoption of B.G.F., alleging that his father failed to show up for the birth of his child.  The court found that, contrary to the defendant's claims, the defendant failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he was the father of the child, that the child was biologically his, and that the defendant had failed in his duty as a putative father by failing to provide adequate support to the child. The court also found that the defendants had not provided sufficient evidence to support their claims.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Step-Dad.  On May 24, 2018 a federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, entered a judgment against Father, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Father consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to comply with the court orders, and imposes a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the filing of the adoption petition. The judgment also prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating as an unregistered broker-dealer in an offering of an investment in a company or a municipal securities firm. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-14-20, May 18, 2018.
