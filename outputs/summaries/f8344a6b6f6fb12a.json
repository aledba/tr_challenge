  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Annette H., a mother of a child who was found to be a child in need of aid based on a hair follicle test positive for controlled substances. The court found that, in October 2016, Annette and Matthew were the subject of a series of reports to OCS, none of which were substantiated before October 2016. According to the court's order, the complaint alleged that Annette was uncooperative with her husband, Matthew, who was a convicted felon not in compliance with registration requirements, and that Matthew and Annette did not participate in the family reunification efforts because they were unaware of their guest\u2019s history of substance abuse and mental health issues. Annette also allegedly refused to participate in community-based family support services because she was afraid that one or more of their guests might have exposed Justin to the drug. The order also found that the complaint was false because Annette had not completed any substance abuse or mental health assessments, and Matthew had not participated in family services designed to provide support services to the child. The complaint further alleges that, when Annette refused to comply with the court order, Matthew continued to visit her, often without Annette or Matthew, despite OCS having limited his visits to the house and to Justin.  The complaint also alleges that Matthew was aggressive towards Annette, who had difficulty establishing a relationship with Annette as a result of her drug use.  Annette agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Northern New York announced criminal charges against Matthew. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by the Office of Children's Services (OCS) and the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Ostrove. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Family and Home Affairs."
