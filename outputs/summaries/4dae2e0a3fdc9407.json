  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against Kenneth Brian Weaver, Jr., who was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to a term of forty years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), with ten years suspended and five years of supervised probation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on September 22, 2015, Weaver shot Sara Lynn Beard aka Sara Lynn Mullett in the face with a.380-caliber handgun.  According to the complaint, shortly after the shooting, Sara's body was found in a pond in Lauderdale County, Mississippi.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Weaver.  On January 4, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Weaver, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Weaver consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and from participating in any future officer-director or director-registration program for any SEC-funded program.  Additionally, the court denied Weaver's motion for a directed judgment against him, which was denied by the trial court on January 5, 2019.    In its order granting the court's order, it also ordered Weaver to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, which is equal to the amount of restitution he will be ordered to pay to the victims of the alleged crime. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Brentley Davis and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mississippi State Attorney General's Office, and the Mississippi Office of Criminal Investigations."
