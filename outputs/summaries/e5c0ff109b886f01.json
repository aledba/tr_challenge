  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against a Framingham, Massachusetts resident for defrauding his or her landlord.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that, in 2013, the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office (\"Attorney General\") filed an emergency action to halt the alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 15B of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the attorney general's office obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of a private company that owned and operated an ALR in Framingham.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the private company was not required to pay upfront fees for services that are not covered by the security deposit statute.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the landlord-tenant relationship is not subject to the same federal and state laws and regulations.

The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, which is pending final approval by the court. The SEC also issued an order freezing assets held by the defendants and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amounts of $2,500 and $3,500, respectively. The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") as well as an officer-and-director bar against the violators of the above-mentioned provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and a penny stock bar against each of the defendants. In a related administrative proceeding, the court granted the relief sought by the SEC and the court against the other defendants. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, John R.
