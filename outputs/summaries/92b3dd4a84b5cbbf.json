  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a New York-based company for its alleged role in an airport congestion scheme.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, since 1968, the Federal Aviation Administration has restricted the number of takeoffs and landings at certain highly congested airports in order to reduce inefficient flight delays.  According to the complaint, Exhaustless Inc. and its co-defendant, John F. Kennedy Airports, LLC, raised the issue of whether to vacate the interim orders, which were issued by the agency in October 2008.  In a complaint filed in federal court in New York, the SEC alleges that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Kennedy and LaGuardia violated Section 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(3) of Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-1 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that in 2000, the FAA issued an interim order requiring the airport authority to determine whether to grant an exemption from slot limitations, which caused the airport to account for 25% of flight delays nationwide.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The court also granted the companies the right to apply for a temporary restraining order, which is subject to court approval.  On May 10, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica granted the SEC\u2019s request for an asset freeze and ordered the issuance of an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver. The SEC also ordered the receiver to conduct an independent review of the receivership order and to provide a copy of the final order to the receiver, which will be reviewed by the court upon motion of the SEC.  A hearing is scheduled for May 21, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17,222 (Aug. 29, 2003).  The Commission on Civil and Administrative Procedure has issued an Order Order Order No. 10-b2107 (Sept. 10, 2003) that prohibits the issuance, purchase, sale, lease, or trade of any type of emergency relief. The Commission has also issued an order requiring that the receiver assesses the emergency relief sought by the receiver against any violation of the anti-head tax provisions of the federal securities laws. In addition, the Commission has issued a Request for a Temporary Restraining Order (RFI) to prevent the receiver from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in"
