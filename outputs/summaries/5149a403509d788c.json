  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment against defendant J.J. Newberry, Co. (Newberry), which, in its second supplemental judgment, ordered Newberry to pay $657,166.45 in attorney fees and $82,752.62 in costs.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that Newberry violated the antifraud provisions of Section 20(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 20b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees for several attorneys from a San Francisco law firm whose hourly rates significantly exceeded the rates for comparable legal services in Portland.  According to the complaint, defendants failed to adequately account for the fees awarded in the first supplemental judgment and failed to consider the independent basis for the court's decision to award the attorney fees.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant failed to disclose to the trial court that it had improperly awarded attorney fees based on the fact that the attorney had provided services both on behalf of the settling plaintiffs and other plaintiffs who had settled with Newberry.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Newberry agreed to a five percent reduction in the amount of attorney fees that it would have paid to settle the case. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 545 (2)(a)(i) (2014).  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On May 26, 2015, the court issued a second judgment that permanently enjoins Newberry from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay civil penalties of up to $1.5 million. The court also ordered the settlement to be approved by a court at a later date.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Newberry based on a related administrative proceeding that resulted in a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  Newberry has also agreed to pay a $1 million civil penalty and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in a parallel administrative proceeding. The SEC is continuing to investigate the matter of whether or not Newberry overstated its fees by more than $100,000.  It has also issued an order appointing a receiver to determine the appropriate amount of fees to be paid to the receiver.  This matter is being handled by John Hyland, Williamsen & Bleid, Inc., and Graham Loomis of the Boston Regional Office."
