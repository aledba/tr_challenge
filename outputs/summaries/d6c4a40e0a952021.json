  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against George W. Dillon, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison in December 2017.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Dillon violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from December 21 through December 21, 2017, Dillon entered a 7-Eleven in Lynwood, Washington, and demanded that he pay supervision fees as determined by the court, which he did not do.  Instead, the complaint alleges, Dillon made threatening and aggressive statements to the store clerks, and threatened to cut and shoot them.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Dillon.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Dillon consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $500 victim assessment fee, and bars him from participating in any future offering of a penny stock.  On December 22, 2018, the court granted Dillon's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to be enjoined from future securities law violations, including securities fraud, securities laws violations, and officer-and-director and conduct-based injunctive relief. The court also granted Dillon the right to return a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions, ordering him to comply with the court's orders, and imposing a civil penalty of $500,000.  To settle the SEC\u2019s charges, Dillon also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,038, and to be suspended from serving a five-year period of supervised release.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, the FBI, and the FBI in this matter.  For further information, see Press Release No. 5, 2018."
