  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to adequately investigate the safety and health risks posed by the release of radioactive materials from a DOD-owned facility.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in 1940 and 1941, the federal government operated the Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant on 105 of the 605 acres in Bethpage, New York.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, these activities were conducted pursuant to CERCLA and the Department of Defense's Rule 12(b)(1) and (3) under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Defense.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  On March 24, 2018, the SEC filed an amended complaint against the Defendants, charging them with violations of Section 9604 of the Exchange Act and Rule 9604 thereunder, and with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) in the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The amended complaint also charges the Defendants with violating Rule 12b-1, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against each of the defendants.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5 (Feb. 24, 2010).  The Complaint also names the defendants as relief defendants, and the SEC is seeking a preliminary injunction against further violations of Rule 9605.  It also seeks an order appointing a receiver to oversee the remediation efforts at the Bethpage facilities.  Finally, the Complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 5(b).  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order temporarily freezing the assets of the three defendants, freezing their assets, and imposing a $50,000 civil penalty.
