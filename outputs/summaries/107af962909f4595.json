  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the hospital's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Whittier, New York, alleges that on March 5, 2009, Catherine Flores, a hospital patient, fell from her hospital bed while attempting to get up from her bed.  According to the complaint, Flores was injured when the latch on the bedrail failed and the rail collapsed, causing her to fall to the floor.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Flores' injury resulted from alleged negligence in the use and maintenance of hospital equipment and premises.  In its judgment, the court found that the hospital violated the antifraud provisions of Section 340.5 of the federal securities laws, and ordered the hospital to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the hospital consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating these provisions, and ordering it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000 and a $500,000 civil penalty, and to pay an officer and director bar and a penny-per-day bar.  On March 2, 2011, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital, alleging that it violated the federal anti-fraud provision, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  It also charged the hospital with violating the \"standards and practices\" provision of section 340.6, which requires hospitals to maintain reasonable care in the rendering of professional services to patients.  For example, the complaint alleges that, in the medical care of patients, a doctor or other health care provider may commit a negligent act or omission, such as negligence in performing the medical diagnosis and treatment of a patient, or aiding and abetting a patient's medical diagnosis or treatment. The court also found that, under the federal law, a physician or a health care professional is liable for a reasonable and adequate warning of a serious medical condition when performing professional services. The SEC further found that a hospital employee negligently left the rails on her bed unsecured while she fell, and thus was not subject to the delayed discovery rule of section 339(1).  The court agreed with the hospital and agreed to a permanent injunction and asset freeze, and with the appointment of a receiver."
