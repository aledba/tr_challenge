  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against a former Ohio-based IT manager who was denied a long-term disability benefit because of his severe back pain.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio on May 26, 2016, Jesse Bruton was employed as a technology development manager with Resource Ventures, LTD. to provide short-term and long term disability benefits to its employees. The complaint alleges that Bruton failed to meet the \"Regular Attendance\" requirement under the terms of the Resource Ventures employee disability benefits plan, which requires a person to be in regular attendance of a physician to manage and treat a disability. Bruton also allegedly failed to follow standard medical practice to manage his pain as he was prescribed increasing doses of opioid pain medication despite largely normal physical exam findings.  The complaint further alleges that he failed to undergo an updated MRI as Dr. Briones had recommended.  Bruton then filed a second application for short term disability, alleging that he was unable to perform his regular work duties due to a combination of debilitating back pain and the impairing cognitive effect of medication required to treat that back pain, and that he had not yet tried the aquatic therapy that Ms. Naderer had suggested.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Bruton consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement plus prejudgment interest.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Bruton. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier, Kelly L. Gibson, Jennifer C. McKinley, and Amy S. Cotter of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Department of Health, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
