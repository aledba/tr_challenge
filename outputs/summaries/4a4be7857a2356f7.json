  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against a Michigan-based physician who provided treatment for a severe neuroma.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, Rickey D. Kennedy, a resident of Terre Haute Regional Hospital, received treatment in 2010 and 2011 for a neuroma, or a \"painful end\" of a nerve that has been traumatized and is \"swelling \"in its response or attempt to heal.\"  The complaint alleges that Dr. Glock, who was a member of the medical review panel, performed the neuroma procedure on Kennedy, and that he provided expert testimony in support of the treatment.  The SEC alleges that the jury found that Kennedy had a reasonable chance of recovering from the surgery, but that he did not have a substantial change in his quality of life or the amount of pain resulting from the procedure.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against Kennedy.  On October 5, 2018, the court granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of Kennedy, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering a permanent injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Kennedy consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $2,300,000, prejudgment interest of $1,500, and a civil penalty of $250,000.  Kennedy also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization and to pay a $100,000 civil penalty.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for October 13, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 17(b)(2) of 2018, Litigation Bulletin No. 13, Lit. Release No.: (1) No. 10(a)(2)-17(b2) or (3) of 2019.  Litigation Alert: (4) No Securities Act, No Securities Rule, no Exchange Act, and No. 12-20(a).  The court granted the motion for partial summary judgment and ordered a hearing on October 5.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC's litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Werner."
