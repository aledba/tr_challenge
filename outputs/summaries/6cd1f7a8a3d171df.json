  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a preliminary injunction against two individuals charged with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal trademark laws.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Christian Picciolini and Free Radicals Project, a Chicago-based nonprofit that provides self-described \"deradicalization\" and \"disengagement\" services to people seeking to leave extremist groups, violated the registration provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from at least 2011 through 2017, Picciulolo, a former member of the Maniac Latin Disciples, created and operated a website called \"Life After Hate\" to help people exit extremist hate groups.  Picciololo allegedly told one of the site's users that he owned the mark and that he would use it to \"help people with their life after leaving those hate groups.\"  The complaint further alleges that Picciolo replied that he did not have the right to use the mark, that he had previously used it, and that his \"ability to prevent dangerous violence and extremism\" would be chilled if the injunction were denied.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's order filed in federal court in New York, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Picciulo.  On May 29, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  A hearing is scheduled for June 5, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-19, July 17, 2018. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant search tool to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and\u00c2\u00a0find information about people who have been injured or harmed by an act of the same nature.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Department of Justice in this matter."
