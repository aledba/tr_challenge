  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Canadian man who pleaded guilty to receiving and distributing child pornography.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Lawrence Lynde, who was sentenced to prison in October 2015, engaged in trading child pornography online.  According to the complaint, Lynde had used a computer to create the images, which he described as sadistic or masochistic conduct and the sexual abuse of a toddler. The complaint further alleges that Lynde knew the nature and severity of the child-pornography offense, which causes \"incalculable\" and \"devastating\" harm to child victims.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that the court improperly applied the \u00a7 3553(a) enhancements to Lynde's case because they did not adequately distinguish him from other child pornography offenders.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Lynde from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of five years and a statutory maximum of twenty years.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Office of Inspector General today issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an investor's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov account.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of child pornography, warning investors to be wary of investing in investment projects that may be at risk of being misused.  Investors should be aware that\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's Investor Alert encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of anyone selling, offering or offering investment in any investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov. \u00c2\u00a0In addition, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Canadian Securities and Exchange Commission in this matter."
