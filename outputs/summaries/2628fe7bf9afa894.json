  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 50 years in prison for his role in a 2015 CVS drug store robbery.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, alleges that, during closing arguments for the sentencing phase of a non-violent robbery case, the defendant showed a video of a lion at a zoo trying to eat a human baby through protective glass. The video was included in the record and is available for viewing on the Court's website here. The complaint alleges that Appellant used the video to convince the jury that he was a vicious lion trying to get to a baby, and that he had a \"bestial aspect\" to his criminal history. The court also found that the defendant had a long criminal history, including a 2013 conviction for forgery with a sentence of 10 months in state jail; a 2002 conviction for attempted unauthorized use of a motor vehicle with a penalty of eight months in county jail; and a 1994 conviction for theft from a person enhanced to a third degree felony and resulting in an additional sentence of 14 years' imprisonment.  According to the complaint, the video was not merely an example of a proper plea for law enforcement; rather, it was a direct response to the defendant's repeated attempts to steal a baby from a baby.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's judgment, the Defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 50 years and a $100,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Appelant. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  An SEC examination that led to the SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Dallas Police Department, the Texas State Attorney General's Office, and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice."
