  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the City of Newark in a civil action brought by the New Jersey Department of Revenue.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Newark, alleges that the city violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder by failing to respond to a Chapter 91 request for income and expense information.  According to the complaint, the city failed to respond within 45 days of the filing of the complaint.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, the City failed to adequately disclose to the court that the subject property was not income-producing.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (c) thereunder, and orders the city to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,488,700.  Additionally, the court granted the city's motion for discovery, which is required by the federal securities laws, to be conducted in accordance with the procedures of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 5(b).  The court's order also prohibits the city from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer in connection with an exemption request for certain real estate.  On October 19, 2017, the New York District Attorney's Office filed an emergency action against the city, charging the city with violating Section 5 and Rule 15a-1 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  To learn more about Section 15A, see Litigation Release No. 564."
