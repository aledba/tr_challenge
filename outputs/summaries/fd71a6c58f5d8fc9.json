  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against two former officers for their roles in a drug ring that stole more than $900,000 from drug dealers.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Bryan Watson and David Hansberry worked as undercover narcotics agents for the Detroit Police Department, stealing drugs and money from dealers. According to the complaint, the defendants used their positions as police officers to steal drugs from dealers knowing that the dealers would steal the money. The complaint further alleges that the defendants took drugs from the dealers and used their position as officers to take the money, which was then used to make charges against the dealers. In addition, the complaint alleges that Watson and Hansberry were tipped off by a recording of a phone call between a drug dealer and another drug dealer. The SEC alleges that, in reality, neither Watson nor Hansberry had a quid pro quo agreement with the dealers, and the defendants did not steal the stolen money. In fact, according to the SEC, neither defendant has ever been convicted of a felony, and neither defendant had ever been sentenced to a prison term. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced charges against both defendants.  In a related case, the SEC filed a parallel criminal action against Watson, alleging that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he aided and abetted the violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 21, 2020).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and Amy S. Cotter of the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the U.K. Attorney\u2018s Office, the FBI Criminal Investigation Division, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the British Columbia Securities Commission, the Swiss Financial Conduct Authority and the Swiss Securities and Exchange Commission."
