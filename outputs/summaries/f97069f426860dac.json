  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment against Oklahoma-based NGL Energy Partners, LP and its general partner, NGL energy Holdings, LLC, for defrauding the company's auditors.  The SEC's complaint, filed on October 8, 2015, alleges that, in October 2015, Krimbill sent an email to a Tulsa County district court alleging that he had libeled his friend, a former NGL employee, in an effort to convince the district court to dismiss the complaint.  According to the complaint, the complaint further alleges that Krimbilled his friend because he believed NGL was a \"public figure\" and had a \"high degree of awareness of \"the probable falsity\" of the information contained in the complaint.\"  The complaint also alleges that the complaint was filed in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 15b-5 thereunder, and that, as a result of the alleged misconduct, the defendants were not entitled to a judgment imposing a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On March 24, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a preliminary injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction against further violations of Sections 13(a)(1) and 13(b)(2)(A) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and a penny stock bar against each defendant.  A hearing on March 26, 2016, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Oklahoma Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1434(D).
