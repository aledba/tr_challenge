  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment in favor of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission against UGI Utilities, Inc.-Electric Division (UGI).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on January 15, 2020, alleges that the Commission violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1301(b) of the federal securities laws by approving a rate increase for UGI in violation of Section 315(e).  According to the complaint, UGI failed to establish that it would use the year-end methodology when calculating its rate base.  The complaint further alleges that UGI did not provide sufficient evidence to support the Commission's finding that it had overstated its rates by more than 50 percent.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of UGI's overstated rate base, the utility was unable to meet its obligations under Section 315 (e) and its obligations as a member of the General Assembly.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Commission has agreed to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions, orders it to pay a civil penalty of $75,400, and orders the utility to provide an accounting of the amount of any additional costs incurred.  OCA's complaint also seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the anti-ratemaking provisions, and a temporary restraining order prohibiting UGI from participating in any rate-setting proceeding.  On January 19, 2020 the court entered an order ordering the Commission to conduct a conduct-based investigation of the utility's rate base and to determine whether it violated the reporting provisions of Sections 315 and 1301.1 of the Public Utility Act of 1940 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering the commission to conduct an independent investigation, and ordering the company to comply with the reporting requirements of the Commission.  Finally, the court issued an order imposing a temporary asset freeze and other emergency relief.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter in the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and\u00c2\u00a0"
