  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in favor of the defendants in a case brought by the Greenwich, Connecticut Planning and Zoning Commission.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Greenwich, Conn., Neighbor to Neighbor, Inc. (Neighbor), a charitable corporation that provides clothing and food to people in need within the Greenwich community for approximately forty years, filed a special permit application and a preliminary site plan application with the commission on October 14, 2015. The complaint alleges that the commission improperly concluded that the proposed building was in compliance with the requirements of the federal building codes, and that it did not meet the needs of Neighbor and the people it serves.  The complaint further alleges that, in its opinion, the Commission improperly found substantial evidence that Neighbor provided no evidence to the commission that the building was consistent with the regulations, that there was no adverse impact to the neighbors' properties arising from the construction of the building, or that there had been any significant adverse impacts on the neighbor's properties.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 6-94 (b) of the municipal building codes. The court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 each.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $20,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Office of Inspector General in this matter."
