  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a default judgment against Velmur Management Pte. Ltd. (\"Velmur\"), a Singapore-based real estate management company, and its principal, Benjamin Whitley, for violating the anti-money laundering and bank fraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Velmur and his company, Velatlantic Partners, engaged in a scheme to subvert international sanctions through the use of front companies.  The complaint alleges that Velmur allegedly wired nearly $7 million to three North Korean front companies, using United States banks as conduits, for the purpose of laundering money or purchasing gasoil on behalf of North Korea.  As alleged in the complaint, these front companies allegedly made approximately $6,000 in illicit wire transfers to Velmur, which were routed through United States bank accounts.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Financial Regulation (OFI) today announced that it has obtained a court order freezing Velmur's assets and imposing civil money penalties.  Velmur has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $'21,691,187.30, which is equal to the amount of the civil money penalty sought by the United States.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the court also ordered Velmur to pay a $1,071,251 civil penalty.    The SEC's investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Mr. Whitley.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2017."
