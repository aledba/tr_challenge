  "summary": "On June 4, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against Joshua Tree Downtown Business Alliance, Inc., a California-based business association, against the County of San Bernardino for failing to adequately consider the potential impact of a proposed retail store on the community.  The court found that the County violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its order, the court also ordered the County to consider whether the proposed project would cause significant adverse environmental impacts.  According to the court's order, however, the County did not adequately consider that the project could cause significant urban decay.  Instead, the Court found that, based on the evidence presented, the project was inconsistent with the policies and practices of the county.  As a result, the county could not proceed to the third tier of the review process.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, the Alliance consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the County from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders it to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIR).  In a parallel action, the California Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued an order suspending the issuance of an EIR and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  On June 5, 2018, the District Court entered a judgment against the Alliance, ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $25,000, and imposing an $8,500 civil penalty against the company, and ordering the company to comply with the court order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Los Angeles Regional Office and the Office of Inspector General, with the assistance of the California Office of Planning and Inspections, and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mark Cranston and supervised by Julia N. Tuttle. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.
