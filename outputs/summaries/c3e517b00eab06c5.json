  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Karbino William Barac, Jr., a St. Joseph, Missouri man who was convicted of driving while intoxicated as an aggravated offender after a bench trial.  The SEC's complaint, filed on April 5, 2017, alleges that Barac violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  Barac has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a penalty of five years' imprisonment.  In its order, the court also ordered Barac to submit to field sobriety tests and a chemical breath test, which Barac refused to do.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Barac consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 5 and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay a civil penalty of 5 years, and pay a $10,000 civil penalty. Barac also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Kathleen M. McCole granted Barac's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return to the station where he was previously incarcerated. The court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interests, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri State Corporation Commission in this matter."
