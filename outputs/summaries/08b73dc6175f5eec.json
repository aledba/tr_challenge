  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of South Carolina today entered a final judgment against Michael Antwon Fuller, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in a 2013 car accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Aiken, South Carolina, alleges that, on December 4, 2014, the trial court improperly barred Fuller from cross-examining his accuser about her prior convictions for driving under the influence (DUI) and assault and battery (ASB).  The complaint further alleges that the defendant told the victim that he had had two glasses of wine and a fireball shot during the night of the accident and had consumed a stolen pistol shortly after the incident.  According to the complaint, the victim told the officer that she had had three alcoholic drinks during the celebration and that she was apprehensive about being charged with a felony.  In addition, the complaint alleges that when the victim confronted Fuller about his prior DUI convictions, he allegedly told her that he was a recovering alcoholic, had been diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and was taking prescription medications for these conditions at the time of her encounter with Fuller.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Fuller agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and requires him to register as a sex offender with the SEC as a member of the Commission on the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Additionally, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Fuller, as well as an order requiring him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and a $50,000 bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  On March 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Fuller and ordered him to return to the United States and pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  Last week, the U. S. Attorney's Office for South Carolina announced criminal charges against Fuller arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  To learn more about pre-judgmental proceedings, see the SEC Litigation Release Release Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019).  In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained an order appointing a receiver to conduct an examination of the alleged victims of the car crash.  Among other things, the investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office."
