  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment against the Secretary of Health and Human Services in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Des Moines, Iowa, alleges that the Secretary violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Exchange Act.  According to the complaint, the Secretary's decision was arbitrary, capricious and contrary to the intent of the Exchange Act, and did not apply to all of the hospitals.  In addition, the complaint alleges the Secretary made a \"commonsense\" decision to exclude variable costs from the calculation of total hospital operating costs.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5:16-cv-3117 (Dec. 29, 2017).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Unity Healthcare and Lakes Regional Healthcare, both of which are pending final judgments against the defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Iowa Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
