  "summary": "The Arizona Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing criminal case against a Tucson man accused of stealing a car.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, alleges that Juan Sahagun-Llamas violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, as well as an order requiring the defendant to provide a complete record of the events at trial.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Arizona today announced criminal charges against Sahaguna-llamas.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The court also granted the defendants the right to return to the United States to seek a permanent injunction against future violations, ordering the destruction of any evidence, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of $250,000 and $100,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Arizona Department of Justice and the Arizona Office of Criminal Investigations."
