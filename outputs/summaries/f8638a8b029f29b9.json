  "summary": "On May 17, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered final judgments in favor of the estate of Gregory Hill, Jr., who was shot and killed in his home garage by St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office Deputy Christopher Newman.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on January 14, 2014, Mr. Hill, who was on probation at the time of the shooting, opened the garage door with the gun in his hand and then quickly closed the door in order to avoid being found in violation of his probation.  According to the complaint, as a result of the admission of this evidence, the defendants were able to convince the jury that the defendant had been on probation for a prior felony and that he was not liable under Rule 404(b) for the shooting.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against Hill and Mascara for their roles in the case.  On May 18, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action against the defendants, including a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and a conduct-based injunction, ordering the defendants to return to their respective homes and pay civil penalties of $1.5 million and $2 million, respectively, to be determined by the court at a later date.  A hearing on May 24, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of the Attorney General, the Florida Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 582 (11th Cir. 2011)."
