  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a jury that improperly discharged a juror who was unable to deliberate during jury deliberations.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that the jury deliberated for nearly 90 minutes on August 24, 2016, before discharging Juror No. 7 for failing to deliberate and for prejudging the case.  According to the complaint, the jury was deliberating for three days when one juror complained to the court that she was \"clammed up\" and \"uncomfortable.\"  The complaint further alleges that one of the jurors had told a third juror that he disliked being on the jury because it was hard to keep an open mind.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the juror.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court granted the jury's request for a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and an officer and director bar against the jury.  On August 26, 2016 the court issued an order requiring the jury to be questioned by counsel, including the jury foreperson, to determine whether the jury had engaged in a reasonable deliberation and whether it was reasonable to discharge a defendant based on his or her inability to deliberate.  As a result of the court's order, the jurors were not permitted to participate in jury deliberations, and the court improperly discharged them.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5 (2014).  The Court also issued an Order suspending the jury from further deliberating on the issue of whether to discharge the jury at a later date.  It also ordered the court to conduct an independent examination of the conduct of the jury and to consider the merits of the findings of the trial court's investigation.  Finally, the Court of Appeals today issued a Final Judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendant to pay disgorgement of $12.69 million, prejudgment interest of $2.2 million, and a civil penalty of $500,000.   The court also issued a preliminary injunction against the defendant, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains and pay a $1,500 civil penalty, and ordering the defendant's immediate family to pay a total of $192,000 in restitution and a $100,000 officer anddirector bar.
