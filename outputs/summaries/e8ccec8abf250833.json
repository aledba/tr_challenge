  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Michael Terrill Faircloth, Jr., a Florida resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Faircloth entered a guilty plea on the basis that he had prior Florida felony convictions for second- and third-degree grand theft, felonious firearm possession, escape, and resisting arrest with violence. The complaint further alleges that, in November 2005, a police officer removed Faircloth from a stolen car, arrested him, conducted a search incident to arrest him, and found in his left front jeans pocket six rounds of ammunition manufactured out of state, a knife, and glass tubes consistent with crack pipes. The court granted Faircloth\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, vacated the underlying criminal judgment, and set the case for resentencing.  According to the complaint, Faircloth consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The final judgment permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 922(g)(1) and 924(e) and requires him to pay a civil penalty of 15 years to life. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Florida Office of Inspector General."
