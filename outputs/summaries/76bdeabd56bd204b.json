  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Anthony Ray Abram, Jr., a convicted felon, on the charges of being an accessory after the fact to first- and second-degree murder and first-degree arson.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that on the night of August 31, 2014, Ryan Cooper picked up his friend Alex Garner and they drove up the road to James Kelly's house. According to the complaint, as they drove, Cooper screamed, \"I'm a LK,\" and \"Y'all don't scare me.\" The complaint further alleges that as they passed Cooper's truck, they saw two trucks pass by, one after the other, and that Cooper jumped out of his truck and drove away without telling anyone about the shooting. The complaint also alleges that Alex Abram, his brother, and David Holmes, another co-defendant in the same criminal case, jumped out holding guns and shot Cooper in the forehead at point-blank range. The SEC alleges that neither the transcript nor the audio recording were offered under Rule 612, and the court found no error in allowing the recording to be played for the jury.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against both defendants.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans of the Court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of the evidence in its ongoing litigation against the defendants. The case is being handled by Jeffrey Jackson, Mary Miller, and Donald Campbell of the SEC Enforcement Division's Jackson Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Jackson and Ms. Miller and supervised by Parham Williams."
