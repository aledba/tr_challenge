  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas yesterday entered a final judgment against defendant John S. Young for his role in a scheme to steal millions of dollars from a family member's estate.  The court found that Young was not entitled to the right to a new trial because he failed to disclose material facts about the alleged scheme.  According to the court's order, Young, who was previously convicted of two felony counts of forgery, forged a will, and attempted to steal the estate of his sister-in-law, was the sole beneficiary of the estate when the court found Young guilty of those charges.  Young also allegedly told a trial counsel that he had \"no reason to believe\" that Hartman had forged the will and that he did not believe that he signed it.  In addition, Young allegedly claimed that he overheard Hartman's attorney discussing the need to spend the money quickly to avoid any of the victims making a claim on the estate, that Young had a negative experience with an attorney, and that his friend and former employee, Chris Hartman, cut two pages out of Sullivan's will and filed the will with the court.  He also allegedly described Hartman as a \"shady\" man who did not know how to deal with a person who had a history of domestic abuse.    Young's attorney, Armando Martinez, agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Young from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Young to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Young consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay $1,078,767 in restitution, and imposing a $10,000 civil penalty.  On May 1, 2015, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Young and ordered Young to return to the United States and pay a civil monetary penalty of $167,500, which will be determined by the court at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott Quinn, Tracy Manning, and Graham Loomis of the Fort Worth Regional Office, with the assistance of Assistant Chief of the Criminal Investigations Division.
