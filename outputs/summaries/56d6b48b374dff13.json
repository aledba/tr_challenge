  "summary": "On May 31, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Ford Motor Company and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., both of which are registered to do business in New York.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, Ford, Goodyear, and the two companies consented to general jurisdiction over New York in exchange for the privilege of doing business in the state.  The complaint alleges that Ford, in its entirety, negligently manufactured and designed the Ford Explorer and that Goodyear violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its judgment, the court held that New York courts had jurisdiction over the defendants based on the mere registration and the accompanying appointment of an agent for service of process.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented, on the basis of their representations, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  Ford also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rule 206(3) and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Goodyear agreed to settle the case against it by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 5(a)(1) and 5(c) and ordering it to disgorge its ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a $1,000,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the New York office by Michael J. Bauman and supervised by Marc Blau. The litigation will be led by Ms. Monestier. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department's Retail Strategy Task Force."
