  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against a Michigan woman accused of using a drug-recognition expert to spot a potential threat to her life.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on August 28, 2016, Brenda Gail Hazard, a resident of Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, drove to a local party store to purchase cigarettes. According to the complaint, the victim confronted her ex-boyfriend, Michael Woodall, with a gun and threatened to kill her. The complaint further alleges that defendant told her that the victim was yelling at her, he was going to come at her with his fists in the air, and she hit the victim with her vehicle. The SEC alleges that the complaint was false and that the defendant did not act in self-defense.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on June 20, 2017, entered a final judgment against Hazard, finding her guilty of second-degree murder and operating under the influence of a third-degree felony. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against her from appearing or practicing before the court as an expert. The Court also granted the defendant's request to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged misconduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Hazard consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric Werner and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner."
