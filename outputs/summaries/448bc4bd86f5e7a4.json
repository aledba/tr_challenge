  "summary": "On September 10, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi entered a final judgment against Cameron Dwayne May, Jr., a Mississippi man charged with kidnapping Barbara Jalanivich.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that May violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the complaint, May was charged in March 2017 with two counts of aggravated assault and one count of kidnapping.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Mississippi today announced criminal charges against May.  May has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  On May's motion for a second conviction, the court also granted him a temporary restraining order prohibiting him from further violating the charged provisions, and ordered him to comply with the court's order barring him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, May has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and imposing a five-year officer-director bar.  He has also agreed to be permanently enjoined from associating with any person who has been convicted of a felony with him or her in a civil proceeding.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mississippi Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
