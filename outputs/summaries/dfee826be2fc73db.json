  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment in favor of a Kansas City, Missouri woman who was convicted of an out-of-state felony for endangering the welfare of a child.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City on January 21, 2016, Robin Smith, a resident of Lake Lotawana, Missouri, was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Smith was sentenced to a five-year prison term and ordered to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  The SEC alleges that Smith violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose prior felony convictions that were not included in her criminal history.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Smith consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the securities laws, and orders her to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of her sentence.  In a parallel action, the Missouri Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Smith.  On January 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Smith, charging her with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0The\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act of 1940 and Rule\u00c2\u00a0206(4)-8 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the Kansas City Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Kansas Department of Justice's Criminal Justice Division."
