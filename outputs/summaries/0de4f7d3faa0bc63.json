  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Tennessee today entered a final judgment against a bond bond company and its owner for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, alleges that Cumberland Bail Bonding Inc. (Cumberland) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC alleges that, in exercising their inherent power to regulate bondsmen, Cumberland failed to show that trial courts have inherent authority to adopt \"reasonable regulations\" and \"requirements\" governing bondsmen appearing before them. In addition, the court found that the bondsman violated Local Rule 26.05(B) and suspended Cumberland from writing bonds pending a hearing. The court also ruled that the bonding company violated the local rule by failing to give notice to a defendant of an upcoming court appearance. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Cumberland.  According to the complaint, the SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott M. McCallum and Carol L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, with assistance from John Rymas of the Division of Enforcement's Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter."
