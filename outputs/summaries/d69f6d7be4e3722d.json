  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Wisconsin today entered a final judgment against the Pension Board of the County of Milwaukee against its earlier decision to revoke Dietscher\u2019s pension.  According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in federal district court in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on February 28, 2014, the Board of Supervisors issued an order to revoke the pension of a County employee who had been terminated for fault or delinquency.  The order, which was entered by the court without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, further alleges that the Board failed to consider the facts of the matter when it issued its order.  In its order, the court also entered a temporary restraining order against the Board from violating the pension provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 4.5(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Rule 10b-5(2) thereunder. The order also prohibits the Board and the trial court from imposing any disciplinary action against the individual or entity with which the order was entered. The court also issued a final order suspending the suspension of the pension and ordering the payment of a civil penalty of $186,059, which is equal to the amount of the penalty that the Commission has already imposed.  On May 10, 2017, the District Court issued a decision upholding its previous revocation of Dietschers pension, which it deemed to be unreasonable and unreasonable. The Court also ordered the pension board to provide an independent source of jurisdiction for the revocation.   The SEC's complaint charges the Board with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The complaint also seeks an injunction against future violations of Section 4,5, and a penny stock bar against Dietschery.  Without admitting to the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's action, the Commission and the District Attorney's Office have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions. The Commission has also agreed to the issuance of an order requiring the pension district attorney to conduct an independent review of its pension policy. The Order also requires the pension secretary to provide a copy of the final judgment to the Commission.  Finally, the Court granted the Commission &rsqua;s request for an injunction, and the appointment of a receiver to determine whether the pension should be revoked. "
