  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of felony murder and a firearm offense in connection with the shooting death of Anthony Johnson, Jr.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Tyrone Thomas drove Johnson and Terrance Denson to the townhouse where he and his mother lived with their mother. According to the complaint, Johnson and Denson were going to buy two pounds of marijuana for about $8,600. The complaint further alleges that Appellant told the victims that he had burned the clothes he wore during the shooting, that the gun was gone, and that he painted the car black. The SEC alleges that the defendants were not required to consent to the purchase of the marijuana. Instead, the complaint alleges, the defendants made a series of false statements to the court, including one in which he said, \u201cI know I f**ked up. It\u2019s all messed up.\u201d The SEC also alleges that Thomas told the jury that he would not let Linton count the money, and he asked Linton to weigh the money. The court agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Thomas.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Amy C. Mascianica of the U.N. District Judge's Office issued an order suspending Thomas from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert in drug dealing, and ordering him to pay $1,878 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The order also prohibits Thomas from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future and from making any recommendation to the SEC regarding the conduct of the officers or directors of public companies. In addition, the court has ordered Thomas to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of money he has already paid to settle the SEC case. Thomas has also agreed to a bar prohibiting him from associating with anyone other than his mother or mother-in-law who has been convicted of a felony felony. Thomas agreed to be prohibited from associational law violations and to a conduct-based injunction. Thomas will pay a $2,500 civil penalty. The case is being supervised by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C."
