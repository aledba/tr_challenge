  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arkansas today entered a final judgment against the parents of two children who were removed from their parents' custody due to severe environmental neglect and parental drug use.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that on May 22, 2017, the Arkansas Department of Human Services terminated the parental rights of Nathan Arnold and Jessica Davis.  According to the complaint, neither parent had demonstrated the ability to provide a safe environment and because of the drug-related issues that remained, there was risk of harm in returning NA and ZA to their parents.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Jessica Davis was drug tested and was positive for THC, barbiturates, opioids, benzodiazepine, and Oxycontin, and the parents had not provided any material support to the children since they entered the agency's custody.  As alleged, Jessica Davis had been in inpatient treatment since May 29 and had lived in the filthy home until she was removed from the Department's custody on May 30, 2017.  On May 18, a family-service worker went to the home and saw that the condition was unchanged from the last time the parents were in custody, despite repeated requests from the agency to remove the children from the home.  Despite repeated requests, the agency ultimately terminated the parents' parental rights on October 19, 2018, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Jessica Davis consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay child support in the amount of $1,000.  Without admitting or denied the allegations, Jessica and Nathan agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 9-27-341(b)(3)(A)(B) and Rules 9-28-1 and 10-5(c) thereunder of the federal securities laws, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the termination of parental rights.  Additionally, the court ordered Jessica to comply with the court's order to submit to drug-and-alcohol testing and follow all recommendations, obtain appropriate housing, maintain contact with the Department and disclose all contact information, exercise visitation, and display proper parenting.   The court also granted Jessica's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits her from associating with any third party, including the FBI or the Department of Health and Human Services.
