  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Massachusetts.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Edgartown, New York, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that they violated the prescriptive easement provision of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the defendants' use of the beach from 1938 to 1999 was limited to occasional walks, shell or driftwood gathering, horseback riding, and vehicle rides.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, from 1958 through the early 1980s, Allen Norton and his family used the beach on a regular basis, even though they did not have the right to do so.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Allen and his wife, Judy Norton, each of whom was an attorney at the time of the alleged misconduct, were well aware of the nature of their use and the adversity of the use, and they engaged attorney Harry Perlstein to provide a legal opinion on the merits of the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint's Complaints, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits. The court also ordered Allen and Judy Norton to pay civil penalties of $500,000 each.  On the other hand, the SEC complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 15a-1 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act and Rule\u00c2\u00a0206(4)-8 thereunder and a conduct-based injunction against further violations of Section 206(3).  The complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order, an injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Allen, Judy, and others from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, security, or other security that may be required of an officer and director of a public company.  Finally, the Court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
