  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Hampshire today announced criminal charges against a New Hampshire man accused of stealing a $10,000 bond.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Hampshire, alleges that, on April 6, 2017, the trial court issued an arrest warrant and ordered the forfeiture of the bond. The court found that the defendant had failed to fulfill his obligations as a surety by failing to comply with bail conditions.  According to the complaint, the court also failed to adequately consider the impact that its order would have on the cost of surety bonds and the \u201c\u2018ability of defendants, particularly defendants without significant financial resources, to obtain bonds.\u2019\u201d  The complaint further alleges that the court failed to consider the risk of forfeiture when it issued the arrest warrant, the amount of his bail, or the severity of the bail violation.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the bail and recognizance provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of the Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending the asset freeze pending a court order to determine whether to issue a civil injunctive action against the defendant.  On May 9, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action, seeking a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against any defendant who violated the bail provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeking a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  To learn more about asset forfeiture, see Litigation Release Order No. 598-A:2 (2001).  The Office of Inspector General's Office also issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint\u00c2\u00a0on the subject of asset forfeiture.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of anyone offering or selling an investment by\u00c2\u00a0using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
