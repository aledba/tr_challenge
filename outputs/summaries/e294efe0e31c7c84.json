  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania yesterday entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania-based self-insurance fund that paid workers' compensation benefits to a self-insured public company.  The court's order, which was entered on May 31, 2018, finds that the Delaware Valley Workers' Compensation Trust is entitled to subrogation of workers' Compensation benefits from a third party.  According to the order, the Trust was established by \"a group of homogeneous employers to pool their liabilities for workers compensation benefits\" and, in any event, it cannot subrogate the benefits paid to an employer.  For example, the court held that the Trust paid only Heart and Lung benefits to the company, but did not consider the employer's payment of those benefits as subrogated.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office issued an NCP accepting liability for a work-related injury that rendered him temporarily unable to work.  As alleged in the SEC's complaint, the NCP did not include Heart and lung benefits, and it did not require the employer to pay full wages to the injured employee.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the trust paid only wage and medical benefits, which were paid in the amount of $85,237.63, which is comprised of $25,375.86 in wage loss compensation and $59,861.77 in medical compensation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's opinion, the trust consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1720 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the Trust to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On August 2, 2019, the Court granted the Trust's request for a second review of its compensation, finding that it had not settled any personal injury action against any third party, and that it was entitled, for all intents and purposes, subrogating the benefits of the Trust.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Philadelphia Regional Office, and supervised by Eric Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Office of Insurance Regulation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0ad\u00c2\u00a0investor"
