  "summary": "The U.S. Department of Transportation today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing administrative proceeding against Norwegian Air International Limited, alleging that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that the Secretary of Transportation improperly granted Norwegian Air's request for a foreign-carrier permit.  According to the complaint, the Secretary had no obligation to consider whether a foreign carrier was qualified to provide the air service by its home country under an international agreement, and that he had failed to connect the airline's entry to the narrow injury upon which it sought to ground standing, i.e. an involuntary furlough, finding that the airline was qualified and designated by Ireland under the Air Transport Agreement, thus satisfying paragraph 2(A).  The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the airline.  In its order, the court also ordered the airline to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the airline consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) of\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0Federal securities laws, and orders it to pay civil penalties of $10,000 and $20,000, respectively.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations, and the litigation will be led by Brian Egan and Amy Gwiazda. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom's Department of Justice, the U.K.'s Department of Commerce, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the British Columbia Securities Commission, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Canadian Securities and Exchange Commission."
