  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a case brought by the California Office of Environmental Quality.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that the 14th District Agricultural Association and its noard of director, Bud Thoman, violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by approving a Class 23 exemption for the normal operations of public gathering facilities.  According to the complaint, Thoman and his company, Stop the Rodeo, raised the issue of whether the exemption was appropriate for the purpose of normal operation of a public gathering facility.  In its opinion, the court held that the exemption is inapplicable because the proposed project did not meet the criteria for a categorical exemption, and that, in fact, the project was not subject to the exemption because it was not a \"normal operation\" of the fairground.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b2-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On June 29, 2011, the Honorable Judge David J. Burt of the United States District Court in the District of Columbia granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other emergency relief. The court also issued an order suspending Thoman from appearing or practicing before the Commission on Environmental Quality, and ordering the District Attorney's Office to conduct an examination of the proposed exemption. The Commission's examination, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Natural Resources, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. The\u00c2\u00a0SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool to identify whether they are registered professionals."
