  "summary": "On August 13, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico entered a final judgment against Giant Cab Incorporated, a New Mexico-based tow company, for its failure to allow Giant Cab to remove certain attached equipment from an accident-damaged taxicab CT Towing had lawfully towed and stored on its lot.  According to the court's order, the tow company agreed to remove the equipment from the vehicle, which was likely inoperable.  The court also found that the equipment was not subject to the lien it was required to hold on the vehicle as part of the underlying realty, and that Torch had installed the dome light, fare meter, relay, and relay himself in customizing and painting the cab after purchasing the cab.  In its judgment, the court found that Torch was entitled to a lien on the vehicles subject to towing and storage liens, and ordered him to return to the vehicle and retrieve the equipment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Torch consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 48-3-19 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,078, and a civil penalty of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-19 (Feb. 13, 2020).  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Scott A. Thompson. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the New Mexico Office of Inspector General in this matter."
