  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California today entered a final judgment against SkyWest Airlines, Inc. and its co-defendant, Wilson, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1404(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, SkyWest and Wilson agreed to settle their charges by agreeing to transfer all three cases to a single federal district court.  The complaint alleges that SkyWest agreed to transfer Wilson, Hirst, and Tapp, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to a court in which it had jurisdiction over the three cases.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Wilson and Hirst for their roles in SkyWest's alleged violations of the federal securities laws.  SkyWest also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, which is equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting to these violations, Skywest and Wilson consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of these provisions, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $150,000 each, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty for each of the three defendants.  On June 18, 2019, the U. S. District Judge for the Western District of New York granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered SkyWest to comply with the court's order.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Office of Inspector General, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Illinois Department of Insurance, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations Division, the Department of Justice's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and the Missouri Office of Financial Regulation.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 15-CV-00656, 2015 WL 4036258, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 4, 2017).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling or offering them investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov website\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.
