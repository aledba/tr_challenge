  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan on October 6, 2016, entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing their assets, and imposing a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Robert Schultz violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Schultz was convicted of two felony counts of assault with a dangerous weapon in Michigan, and was sentenced to four years in the Illinois Department of Corrections, plus two years of mandatory supervised release.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Schultz consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court granted the defendant's request for a preliminary injunction, ordered a hearing on the merits of the case, and ordered a conduct-based injunction against future violations.  On October 9, the SEC filed an emergency action in which it obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of both defendants and ordering an asset freeze and other emergency relief. The court also issued an order suspending the asset freeze pending final approval by the court of the emergency court.  A hearing scheduled for November 18, 2016 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release No. 5-24-1(e).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant a prior felony conviction for attempted residential burglary, for which the court found that the defendant contemplated the use of force or threat of violence, and a prior conviction for aggravated unlawful use of a weapon.   The court's order freezes the assets held by the defendants and orders the forfeiture of any remaining assets, including cash, with interest in the amounts to be determined by a court at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Sanderson and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Ms. Basinger. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Criminal Justice."
