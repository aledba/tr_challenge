  "summary": "On February 10, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of W.Va.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the defendants were negligent in obtaining and serving a subpoena on Branch Banking & Trust (BB&T) without giving notice to them, which resulted in the wrongful disclosure of their confidential financial information to a third party.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose to the third party that BB&T was taking financial advantage of Mr. Vanderpool's wife, Lila, granting her power of attorney on September 13, 2013, while she was a resident of Brier Rehabilitation and Nursing Center.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.   The court also granted the defendants the right to a temporary restraining order and to appoint a receiver to oversee the receivership of the receiver.  On February 19, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action against the defendants, charging them with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting the defendants\u2019 violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and Rules 5a-5 and 17a-1 thereunder.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 17, 2018).  The complaint also names Cornerstone Marketing, LLC as a relief defendant, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations.  To settle the SEC\u2019s action, the court will determine whether to impose a civil penalty against each defendant. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Commonwealth of Virginia Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in this matter."
