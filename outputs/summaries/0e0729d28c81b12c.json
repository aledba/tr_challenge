The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbia, D.C., alleges that District Attorney General Eric H. Schmidt and Chief of the Internal Affairs Division, Darrell L. Best, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder.  According to the complaint, Schmidt and Best agreed to settle the SEC's charges by agreeing to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to produce records and records relevant to the misconduct or misconduct of their officers. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Schmidt. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Schmidt, charging him with violating Rule 17a-1 and 17b2-3 thereunder, and ordering Schmidt to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000. The complaint also alleges that Schmidt and the District violated Rule 10b-5 thereunder and that Schmidt violated Rule 13a-14 thereunder by failing to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint or the District's findings, Schmidt consented to a permanent injunction against further violations of Rule 13b-14, and Schmidt agreed to pay a $150,000 civil penalty.
