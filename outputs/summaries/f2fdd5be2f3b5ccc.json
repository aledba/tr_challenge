  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of Los Angeles against Levi Family Partnership, L.P., a Los Angeles-based real estate developer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that, in 2003, the Los Angeles City Planning Commission declined to approve a conditional use permit for an eldercare facility for a low-density neighborhood.  According to the complaint, the Commission's findings were insufficient to support the city's decision to approve the project.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Commission improperly failed to disclose that the project was not in substantial conflict with the zoning plan, that it was not detrimental to the neighborhood or the public, and that it did not cause unnecessary hardship.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on May 31, 2013, the court found that the city violated the antifraud provisions of Section 14.3.1 of the California Municipal Code, and ordered the city to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the city consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the city from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders the district to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On June 27, 2014, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the city, charging it with violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(2)(A)(3) of Securities Act Section 10(b) of Exchange Act Rule 10b2-1 thereunder.  Separately, the District Attorney's Office announced criminal charges against the company, its CEO, and its director of operations for violating the federal anti-fraud provisions.   In a parallel action, the California Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued an order appointing an independent receiver to determine whether to issue an emergency asset freeze and other emergency relief. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.K. Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Department of Health and Human Services."
