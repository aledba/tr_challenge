  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil contempt proceeding for failing to pay child support.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, alleges that Christopher Lee Sumner violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Sumner failed to comply with the court's order for him to pay a civil penalty of $8,525.00, reflecting a 12-month delay in payment of the child support obligation.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Father failed to disclose to the trial court that he had failed to pay the obligation at the time it was ordered and that the court had improperly conducted a de novo hearing to determine whether he had the ability to pay it.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Father consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to repay $2,600.00 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of his civil penalty.  Sumner also agreed to pay $3,323.70 in attorney's fees, which he did not receive.  On the same day, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Father, barring him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, and from making any payments to a broker or dealer in connection with the issuance of a cease-and-desist order.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Sumner, charging him with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and with violating the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act.  It also charged Sumner with violating Sections 5, 5(b), and (c) thereunder, and Section 9(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 10a-5.   The court also ordered Sumner to pay, on a joint and several basis, $2.5 million in civil penalties, a $250,000 civil penalty, and a $750,000 bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2"
