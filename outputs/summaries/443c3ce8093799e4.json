  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Kyree Howard-Walker, who was ultimately convicted of first-degree burglary and conspiracy to commit first degree burglary.  According to the court's order, the defendants stole approximately $8,000 in cash, numerous credit cards, watches, jewelry, and other valuables from a Colorado Springs home.  The court also found that the defendants were not the only people in the home who had been misidentified in the video.  As alleged in the order unsealed today, Howard- Walker was the only person in the house who had ever been falsely convicted of a felony.  In a parallel action, the court of appeals today entered a final judgment that permanently restrains the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and requires the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court of Appeals granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and a temporary asset freeze, and the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for preliminary and permanent injunctions against further violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s findings, the defendant consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar. The final judgments also require the defendant to consent to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including his right to a fair trial. The order also requires the court to determine whether the defendant is guilty of a pre-judgmental error and whether the jury is entitled to a hearing on the merits of the case.
