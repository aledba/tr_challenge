  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against AT&T, DISH, and EchoStar Satellite LLC in a civil injunctive action brought by the Holguins.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, on November 6, 2006, the Holgars received an emergency court order granting them a temporary restraining order preventing them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that the court improperly relied on jury instructions to determine the amount of attorney fees that should be paid to each party.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the court's order did not apply to all of the parties.  Instead, the complaint alleges, the defendants were entitled to an additional $650,000 in attorney fees based on the jury's finding that they had breached the contract.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael Ketchum of the Los Angeles Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center, and is being supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Ms. Kim and Mr. Blau.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
