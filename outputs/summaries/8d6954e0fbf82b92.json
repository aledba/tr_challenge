  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the defendant in a domestic violence case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that, on August 9, 2013, Daniel B. Sr., a married father of two young children, stabbed Mother in the left shoulder.  According to the complaint, the court ordered Mother to participate in an open-ended program of support group for victims of domestic violence, which is designed to reduce the risk of harm posed by father's drug use.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court issued a temporary restraining order against Father, who was previously incarcerated for drug-related conduct, and issued an order requiring that Mother participate in a \"domestic violence support group.\"  The complaint further alleges that on August 11, 2013 the court granted Father monitored visitation with one of the children during the domestic violence incident.  On August 13, 2014, the DCFS filed a dependency petition on behalf of Mother, charging her with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Mother consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and prohibits her from participating in any type of adult-based domestic violence program for at least five years.  She also agreed to be permanently enjoined from associating with anyone with a history of drug or alcohol-related criminal conduct, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school, and to be prohibited from participating as a member of a family member's association.  As part of the settlement, Mother agreed to a bifurcated settlement in which she would be permanently barred from association with any person with a prior history of substance-abuse or drug use, and that she would not be required to participate as a dependent of a court-ordered program.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  Separately, the Department of Justice announced that it has obtained an order appointing a receiver to monitor and supervise Mother and her children, including Andrew A. and Damian B. B. of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.  A hearing scheduled for October 16, 2013 was scheduled for 11:30 a.m."
