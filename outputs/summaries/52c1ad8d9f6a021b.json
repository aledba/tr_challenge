  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against Kroger Co., Kroger Manufacturing, Compton Creamery, Keith Oldenkamp, Steve Kuebbing, Jesse Turner, Keith Henry, Jill McIntosh and Tony Ramirez (sometimes collectively referred to as Kroger or the Kroger defendants) in a civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 20, 2007, Kroger and its former human resources assistant manager Stephanie Cruise completed an employment application that contained an arbitration clause requiring arbitration of employment-related disputes.  The complaint alleges that the arbitration clause in the employment application was not provided to Cruise when she applied for employment.  Instead, according to the complaint, Cruise was bound by a four-page arbitration policy, which Kroger relied upon, that was merely an undated, unauthenticated page from a Ralph's handbook, and that no contract to arbitrate existed.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, which was filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Cruise.  On November 29, 2012, the court granted a motion to compel arbitration of an employment discrimination action filed by Cruise, who was hired by Kroger in 2007.  As part of the settlement, the company agreed to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty and to pay an officer and director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott Frost, John Rymas, and Eric Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Frost and Mr. Werner. The case is being supervised by Lara.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric Werner and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the San Diego Regional Office, under the supervision of Chedly C. Dumornay."
