  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against the former president of a Kentucky-based electric cooperative and its former general manager for defrauding members of the union that represented them in collective bargaining negotiations.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Kentucky, alleges that David Estepp, Jr. stole a petition calling for the termination of Big Sandy Electric Cooperative Company (RECC) President/General Manager Bobby Sexton. According to the complaint, the petition was stolen from a grocery store on April 12 and placed in a local grocery store. The complaint further alleges that on the morning of April 27, ESTEpp went to the grocery store and removed the petition, which contained defamatory statements about his departure from the company. On June 9, 2017, the Kentucky State Police began an investigation into the theft of the petition. The SEC also filed a complaint in federal district court in Kentucky, alleging that the newspaper violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC announced that it had obtained a temporary restraining order halting the publication of the complaint. The court also ordered the SEC to conduct an internal investigation that was conducted by Lance Daniels, William Maxey, and Lance Daniels of the SEC Enforcement Division's Public Finance Abuse Unit, with the assistance of the Kentucky Attorney General's Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Seitz and Ms. Miller. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 596, 601, 17 S.W.2d 709, 710 (Ky. 1997).
