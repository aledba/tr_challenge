  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia yesterday denied Brown\u2019s motion for relief from a 188-month prison sentence for crack cocaine distribution.  The SEC alleges that Brown filed a pro se petition for relief in 2011, alleging that a federal district court in Richmond, Virginia, improperly appointed a federal public defender to represent him in preparing a presentence investigation report and calculating his advisory sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines.  According to the SEC, Brown was sentenced as a career offender in 2011 and was eligible for a two-level reduction in his base offense level.  Brown also complained that his counsel at resentencing had been ineffective and asserted that one of his prior convictions no longer qualified as a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of his career-offender designation.  As alleged in the complaint, Brown had distributed government forms that identified cooperating sources and ultimately made their way to Brown's drug supplier.  In a parallel action, on December 15, 2016, the court granted Brown a temporary restraining order and ordered Brown to comply with the court order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Brown consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Brown to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, which is equal to the penalty Brown received as a result of his previous conviction under the same federal sentencing guidelines.  Additionally, Brown agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after five years.  On December 12, 2017, the district court denied Brown's request for relief under the sentencing guidelines, finding that Brown was ineligible for a reduction of sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).  Brown timely appealed the court's decision, and on December 19, 2018, the District Court issued a short order halting Brown from making any further filings under the federal securities laws, ordering Brown to return to the court-issued bonds, and ordering him to pay $150,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $20,000.  To settle the SEC case, Brown also agreed to a five-year bar from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney and to a six-year officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Haines v. Kerner, No. 519,"
