  "summary": "On June 29, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against the Board of Zoning Adjustment (BZA) for a special exception to permit the construction of a public charter school on the property.  The court found that the BZA's order violated the intent and purpose of the R-16 Zone, which is intended to be almost exclusively a low-density, single-family dwelling residential zone.  According to the court's order, LAMB was not the appropriate party to request the special exception because it was not in compliance with the requirements of the federal zoning laws.  In addition, the court also found that, as a matter of right, the Board had not conducted an \"improved public review\" as required by the federal regulations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the board agreed to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins L.AMB from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,038,767, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the order imposes a $50,000 civil penalty against L. AMB, which the court found to be unreasonable and inconsistent with the agency's rules.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbia, D.C., charges L.A. with violating the federal securities laws and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar from serving as an officer or director of any public school.  It also seeks an order appointing a receiver to oversee the operation of the public school, and from the District Attorney General's Office with the assistance of the Office of the Secretary of State's Office, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the District's Office of Planning and Zoning Regulation (Opinion).  The case is being handled by John Rymas of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the Atlanta Regional Office, and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance and cooperation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17, July 17, 2018. \u00c2\u00a0On July 24, 2018, the SEC issued an order requiring the District to conduct an improved public review of its application for a Special exception, which included: (1) the number of parking spaces and driveways; (2) there be a wall or fence between the principal building and a right-of-way, if there are more than five open parking spaces; and (3) all lighting used to illuminate the parking spaces must be the minimum necessary for reasonable visibility."
