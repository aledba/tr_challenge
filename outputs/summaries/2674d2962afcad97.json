  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment in favor of the school district's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, N.J., alleges that the Delsea Regional High School District violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the District Board of Education improperly classified the Department of Education's alternative education program as an \"extracurricular\" program.  According to the complaint, Melnyk worked as an instructional and tenure-eligible teacher in a separate, but separate, program for educationally handicapped and special education students, and was required to hold an instructional certification in order to fulfill core curriculum requirements for certain students unable to fulfill those requirements through the district's day program. In addition, the complaint alleges that she was not eligible for tenure because she did not need to hold any additional certification to qualify for tenure in the program. The complaint further alleges that, in addition to requiring her to hold a certification, she was also required to have a length-of-service requirement for her position as a special education teacher.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the district agreed to a permanent injunction and to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Education today announced that it has issued an order appointing a new Commissioner of Education to determine when to issue an order imposing an injunction and appointing a permanent director of education. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Secretary of State's Office, and the FBI in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 2480 (January 24, 2019)."
