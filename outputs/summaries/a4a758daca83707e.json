  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant in a trespass action brought by San Diego-area farmers and ranchers.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, California, Lynda Hoffman and her husband raised horses and other large domestic animals on their property. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1021.9 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court improperly awarded Hoffman $289,153.75 in attorney fees based on her successful trespass and non-fee claims.  The complaint further alleges that, while Hoffman was the prevailing party in the action, she was not entitled to reasonable attorney fees because the defendants' trespass did not cause damage to her land or plants, nor did the trespass damage any of Hoffman's nursery plants.  In its judgment, the court found that Hoffman was entitled to a reasonable attorney's fee for work done to obtain benefits under the insurance policy, but could not recover her attorney fees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hoffman consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On May 16, 2016, the trial court granted Hoffman's motion for attorney fees against SRM, finding that Hoffman obtained a more favorable judgment at trial than she should have, that she had achieved her objective on a tort cause of action for bad faith and that she failed to demonstrate eligibility for such an award as a matter of law.  As a result, Hoffman has not been able to recover attorney fees under the anti-fraud provision of the securities laws, and the court has not issued an order requiring her to comply with the court's order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, the San Diego Police Officers Assn., and the California Office of Inspector General."
