  "summary": "On June 6, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants in an EB-5 visa case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Elgin, Illinois, alleges that, on January 16, 2015, USCIS denied an application by an individual seeking to qualify for an EB5 visa to invest in an assisted living facility located in rural or economically depressed communities where unemployment is at least 150% of the national average.  According to the complaint, the agency's denial was based in part on the fact that Mr. Doe had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its finding that the project was legitimate and that he had sustained his qualifying investment in it.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the agency failed to adequately consider the facts of the transaction when it ultimately denied the individual's request for a summary judgment against USCIS.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The case is being supervised by Jennifer Chun Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office."
