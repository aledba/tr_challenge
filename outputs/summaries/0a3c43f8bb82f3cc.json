  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against Lackawanna Junior College and its athletic director for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on March 29, 2010, the school's athletic director, Kim A. Mecca, raised the issue of whether or not to impose a duty of care on student athletes participating in intercollegiate football practices.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of this conduct, the college and athletic director were unable to perform their duties as required by the federal law.  As a result, the complaint alleges, Defendants failed to comply with the requirements of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The court also found that Defendants violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by failing to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims of liability.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Defendants for their roles in the alleged misconduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders Defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the anti-fraud provision of Section 5(b).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Philadelphia Regional Office by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
