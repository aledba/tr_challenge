  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama today entered a final judgment against Southeast Alabama Rural Health Associates (SARHA), a private nonprofit corporation that provides medical services to the residents of rural southeast Alabama.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that, since 2009, all of its patient records had been stored in SARHA's medical-records database.  According to the complaint, the Greenway defendants failed to establish the existence of an arbitration provision in the BAA entered into between SARHA and the defendants in 2014 that prohibited them from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  In addition, the complaint alleges that SARHA failed to adequately protect its patients' medical records and that, when confronted by SARHA, the defendants told SARHA that they would \"implement and use appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards\" to prevent use or disclosure of protected health information other than as provided for by this Agreement.\"  The complaint further alleges that the defendants' failure to comply with the arbitration provision was a breach of their obligations to SARHA.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, SARHA consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering SARHA to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  SARHA also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
