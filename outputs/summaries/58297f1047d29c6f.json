  "summary": "The Arizona Department of Child Safety today announced that it has terminated the parental rights of three children who were injured while living with their father.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona, alleges that, between 2013 and 2017, Sandra R. and her five-year-old daughter M.R. began living with her father, Sergio C. Scheller.  According to the complaint, J.M. suffered a severe head injury and a large subdural hemorrhage on the left side of her brain, and her arms became stiff.  As alleged, the complaint further alleges that the father and mother did not take steps to protect the children from abuse, and instead continued to minimize the severity of her injuries and provided no alternative explanation for the cause of the injuries.  In a parallel action, the Arizona Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Scheller, alleging that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Scheller consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Separately, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and an order suspending Scheller from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert witness in a case that is being handled by the SEC. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Arizona Office of Child Advocacy and the Arizona Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
