  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona today entered a final judgment against Paul E. and Courtney F. of Arizona, finding that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 25-410(A) of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Phoenix, Paul E., a licensed professional counselor, and his wife, Diana F. Vigil, a licensed clinical trial attorney, agreed that the court should impose a \"specific limitation\" on Paul E.'s ability to make decisions concerning the child\u2019s upbringing, including whether to maintain therapy for L. or require her to wear a skirt and other articles of \"girl\" clothing.  The court also agreed that, in the absence of a specific limitation, the court could compel therapy and consultation with the child.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court of appeals, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the Arizona Department of Education today announced that it has issued an order appointing a new pediatrician to evaluate and treat L. as a \"transgender child.\"  The SEC's order also requires the court to determine whether the child is at risk for physical harm or suffering significant emotional impairment, and that it reserves the right to impose a judgment that imposes a permanent injunction, imposes a civil penalty, and imposes an officer-and-director bar.  Separately, the Department of Justice today announced criminal charges against Vigil and Ehrensaft, charging them with violations of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as with respect to the appointment of a family court as a mediator between parent and child to resolve any issues arising from the child's treatment.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Deborah M. Welshhans of the Arizona Court of Appeals issued an Order appointing Diana Vigil as a consultant to assist with the family court's examination of L.&rsquo;s medical history.&nbsp; The order also prohibits the court from appointing a specific clinician or individual to evaluate or treat a child under the supervision of a physician or other licensed professional.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-403(A).  The Commission on Family Education and Advocacy (CIEA) issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone offering to invest in child-rearing services."
