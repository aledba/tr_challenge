  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Luis Antonio Severino on all 17 counts of aiding and assisting in the preparation of false tax returns, wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Severino was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that the court improperly classified Severino as a \"voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty\" when, in fact, he had not violated the federal tax laws at all.  Severino also was convicted on two counts of wire fraud and for aiding and abetting a scheme to defraud.  In a parallel criminal case, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Severino.  Among other things, the SEC alleges that Severino violated Section 7206(2) of The Internal Revenue Service Act of 1940, and that he aided and abetted violations of Section 3553(a)(1) and (2)(A).  The SEC also charged Severino in connection with the filing of tax returns in violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney or practicing a public accountant.  Separately, the court also ordered Severino to pay restitution in the amount of $50,000.  On November 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the New York District Court issued a temporary restraining order, ordering the SEC to conduct an examination that will determine whether the SEC is entitled to a fair and impartial jury.  Judge Burt also issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the collection and preparation of federal tax returns. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Schiff and Eric S. Werner in the Philadelphia Regional Office, and the case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the U."
