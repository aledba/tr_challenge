  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against a Michigan-based Indian family preservation organization and its founder in an emergency action to revoke the agency's consent to adopt two Indian children.  According to the court's order, filed on February 2, 2016, the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) and Michigan Indian Family Preservation Act (MIFPA) require that a parent or Indian custodian relinquish their parental rights to a child for purposes of adoption.  The court found that, under ICWA and MIFPA, a parent can withdraw consent at any time before entry of a final order of adoption and for the placement of the children with a third party.  In addition, the court ruled that the Indian child's biological father had consented to the termination of his parental rights and that he had a right to return the children to his or her tribe.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, the father and mother have consented, in writing, to the withdrawal of their consent and to the entry of an order suspending their respective parental rights from being placed with petitioners. The court also granted the Tribe's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against the defendants.  On June 14, 2016 the Macomb Circuit Court issued an order requiring the defendants to withdraw consent to the adoption of the two children. The order also requires the court to determine whether any other person or entity has the right to revoke a parent's parental rights or to place the child with a potential adoptive parent.  To determine whether the court has jurisdiction over the children, see Litigation Release Order No. 712B.13(a).  In a related administrative proceeding, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHS) announced that it had obtained an emergency court order to expedite the filing of a consent to adoption order. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Michigan, charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 13b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The complaint also names the Oglala Sioux Tribe as an intervenor in the case.   The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws and seeks a court order suspending the defendants' rights to the children and ordering them to return them to their respective tribes.  For further information, see Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), Section 10(b) and Rule 10b"
