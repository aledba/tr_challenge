  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment in favor of the Calcasieu Parish Police Jury in a worker's compensation offset claim.  The court's order, which was entered on April 12, 2017, requires the CPPJ to prove the amount of workers' compensation benefits it contributed to PERS, and that it is entitled to an offset based on the proportion of contributions it received.  According to the order, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Louisiana, Todd Crochet was injured in the course and scope of his employment with the Commission on Public Employees Retirement Systems (CPPJ) from March 2, 1998 through September 18, 2014, and was deemed entitled to a credit of $98.06 per week for a total of $251.72 per week.  As alleged in the complaint, this offset is based on a percentage of the total payroll for all CPPJs.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Crochet.  On April 13, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for an offset against Mr. Crochet's disability benefits, which were paid out of a trust fund, and ordered him to pay a penalty and attorney fees equal to $42,053.73.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the court's judgment, Crochet consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to repay $43,232.19 in penalties and attorneys fees that he received as a result of his participation in the pension and benefit plan.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Compliance and Assurance, with the assistance of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and the Enforcement Division's Office of Inspector General. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Mr. Curran and Ms. Tully, and supervised by Chedly L. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Louisiana Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Louisiana Department of Insurance, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Alabama Department of Health and Hospitals, the Mississippi Department of Education, the Missouri Department of Banking and Securities and the Louisiana Office of Insurance Regulation."
