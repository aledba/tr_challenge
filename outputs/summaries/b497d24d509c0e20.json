  "summary": "On March 19, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas entered a final judgment against Aaron Jerome Green, Jr., a Kansas City, Kansas man who was convicted of two felony counts of knowing aggravated battery.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salina, Kansas, Green was charged in September 2015 with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(1)(A) and (c) thereunder.  The SEC alleges that Green violated the charged provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to comply with a jury instruction that required him to show cause and effect in a reasonable manner.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Green.  Green has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Green has consented to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any such injunction.  On March 21, Green pleaded guilty to one count of reckless aggravated battery, which is a felony that requires a jury to determine whether a defendant has committed a serious act of self-defence, and a penalty equal to or greater than the amount of his or her penalty.  He has also agreed to be permanently enjoined from associating with any person who has a history of committing a felony, including a conviction for securities fraud, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  As part of the settlement, Green agreed to a $75,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 bar.  After the settlement was reached, Green will be prohibited from violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and he will pay a $25,000 penalty, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  To settle the case against Green, the SEC also instituted an administrative proceeding against him, ordering him to surrender his passport and to be restrained from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 24, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
