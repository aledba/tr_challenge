  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Thomas McCardell for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, as administrator of Physicians Behavioral Hospital in Lafayette, Louisiana, McCartell violated the anti-kickback provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC previously found that McCarty was liable for kickbacks for providing services that were not covered by the federal funds. McCarty agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, and was sentenced to 26 months in prison and a $20,000 civil penalty.  McCarty also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public hospital for five years and ordered to pay a civil penalty of $2,500 per month.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against McCarty.  According to the SEC, McCarty consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay $1,046,329.13 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty equal to the amount of the kickbacks paid to the hospital. The court also ordered McCarty to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of the matter, which is continuing.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the New York District Court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against future violations, and issued a final order imposing a $24,500 civil penalty and ordering McCardella to pay an $80,000 penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about sentencing, see Litigation Release No. 1320a-7b(b)(2).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC Division of Criminal Justice."
