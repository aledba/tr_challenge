  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a judgment in favor of Mutual of Enumclaw Insurance Company (MOE) in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on February 27, 2003, MOE entered into a construction contract to rebuild the home for an estimated cost of $3.8 million and, right before the second anniversary of the fire, he filed a complaint alleging, among other things, that MOE breached the contract when it failed to pay the replacement cost beyond the $\u20021.7 million that he had already paid for the home.  The complaint alleges that, by pleading that he was entitled to prejudgment interest, he had the ability to determine the amount owed to him, less the actual cash value of the damage, and the date from which interest should run.  MOE also alleges that the court did not err in granting the judgment when it improperly applied the doctrine of issue preclusion to the case.  In its judgment, the court held that, based on the facts and the legal question necessary to determine when interest was due, plaintiff was not entitled to an award of interest.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $2.556 million, plus $1.382 million in prejudgment interests, and a civil penalty of $'3.23 million.  Additionally, the judgment orders MOE to pay a $'1.023 million civil penalty, which is equal to the amount that plaintiff spent to rebuild a home of like construction and use and, after the second trial, to pay $'2.55 million in attorney fees and a $1,382 million penalty.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Graham Loomis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
