  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Matthew R. Kroffke, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 114 months in prison for armed bank robbery and brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on March 28, 2018, a federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, granted a downward variance in the sentencing of a convicted robber who had been suffering from severe hip pain for two years when he committed the armed robbery.  According to the complaint, the court failed to adequately consider the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics, the severity of his offense, and the need for punishment or deterrence.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court did not adequately consider any of the factors that led to the downward variance, and instead imposed an 84-month sentence based on the recommendation of the court.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, in a parallel action, on September 21, 2019, the United States District Court in Jackson granted a preliminary injunction, imposed a 10-year officer-and-director bar, and ordered Kroffek to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2,500.  Additionally, the judge granted the SEC a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including in the purchase, sale, or purchase of a security deposit, and prohibits the payment of any civil penalty in the future.  On September 22, 2019 the court granted the court's motion for a hearing and ordered the defendant to surrender his passport.  A hearing on September 24, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  To learn more about sentencing, see Litigation Release Release No. 17-cv-5221 (March 28, 2019).  In a related matter, the SEC filed an amended complaint on September 20, 2019 alleging that the district court violated procedural reasonableness when it imposed an eight-level downward departure without providing adequate explanation for its decision to impose a sentence that was procedurally unreasonable, including any rejection of the parties\u2019 arguments for an outside-Guidelines sentence and any decision to deviate from the advisory Guidelines range."
