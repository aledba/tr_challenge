  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against GEFT Outdoor, LLC, an Indiana-based outdoor advertising company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Westfield, Indiana on December 16, 2017, GEFT began constructing a digital billboard on its property in the City of Westfield without obtaining or applying for a required sign permit. The complaint alleges that Westfield violated its due process rights when it stopped work on its pole and digital sign in October 2017. The SEC alleges that, based on this conduct, Westfield could not have prevented GEFT from continuing its work on the Billboard without obtaining a court order.  The complaint also alleges that GEFT did not comply with the city\u2019s Stop Work Notices, which require the city to show reasonable cause for a stop work order before proceeding with any construction of a sign.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that the city issued a cease-and-desist letter to GEFT in December 2017, informing the company that it would not be able to complete the project until a court ordered it to do so.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Westfields agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the federal securities laws, ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and ordering GEFT to pay disgorgement of $20,000 plus prejudgment interest of $1,500, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000.  GEFT also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the purchase, sale, or issuance of any security deposit. The settlement is subject to court approval.
