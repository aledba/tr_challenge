  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia yesterday entered a final judgment against Wheeling Police Department officers who conducted a traffic stop on a motor vehicle with a burned-out headlight.  The court found that the Wheeling officers violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws when they conducted the stop on August 4, 2010.  According to the court's order, the officers entered the vehicle and observed that Mr. Pompeo, who was driving under the influence, did not comply with the officers\u2019 requests for a secondary chemical test. The court also found that, based on their observations and testimony, he failed to submit to the secondary test.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Department of Health and Human Services (OHHS) today announced that it has issued an order suspending the officer\u2019s driving privileges for a period of six months and a concurrent period of one year.  On September 29, 2010, the OHHS issued a temporary restraining order and issued a preliminary injunction against the officers from further violations of the anti-divergence provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The order also temporarily suspended the officer-in-charge privileges of the OAH for five years and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The OAH also issued an administrative order suspending Mr. Pyszka from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any motor vehicle.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the order, however, the court has ordered the officers to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordered them to pay civil penalties of $2,000 each.  Additionally, the order requires the officer to provide a written copy of the driver's license and to provide proof of impairment in the field sobriety test conducted by the agency.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17C-5-4(a).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Wheeling, Va., charges the officers with violating the antiterrorism provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, an officer-on-duty suspension, and a penny stock bar. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office."
