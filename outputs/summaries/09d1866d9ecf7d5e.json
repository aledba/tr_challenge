  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against Gregory Q. Posey, Jr., a convicted felon in possession of a handgun, ordering him to pay a $1 million civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bowling Green, Kentucky, alleges that Posey was entitled to a first-degree manslaughter instruction based on extreme emotional disturbance when he learned of his friend\u2019s pregnancy.  According to the complaint, Posey called Judge Tyler Gill, the local circuit judge, on March 28, 2016, because he was very upset and felt disrespected and betrayed by his friend, Patrick \"PJ\" Gilbert, who was in a relationship with Posey.

To learn more about EEDs, see http://www.sec.gov/EEDs-1.html.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 598 (Feb. 26, 2019).  The Commission on the Securities and Exchange Commission's (Commission) Division of Criminal Justice announced today that it has issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an examination of the background of anyone who has been charged with a felony in connection with a related criminal case. The Commission has also issued an Order requiring the Court to"
