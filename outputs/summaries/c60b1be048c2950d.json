  "summary": "On December 27, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan entered a summary judgment against Land O'Lakes Purina Feeds LLC, a Minnesota corporation that manufactures and distributes animal feed and related products in Michigan.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Land O\u2019Lakes purina and its subsidiary, Diversified Farms, LLC (Diversified), violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to disclose that certain of its products sickened a herd of dairy cattle.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to adequately disclose that the cattle suffered from iodine toxicity, which is a serious medical condition that can be prevented by a remedy-limiting provision.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.

Among other things, the SEC previously issued an order requiring defendants to comply with a court order requiring them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $3,319.20 per day and $6.00 for each half-day of the feed supplements sold to the herd.  This order also requires defendants to provide a copy of the complaint to the court that is subject to Court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-20 (January 24, 2019).  The complaint also alleges that defendants violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-5(b) thereunder.
