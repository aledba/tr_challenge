  "summary": "On August 1, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) and its acting Chair, Frederick Davie, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that the CCRB violated Section 440(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 440(b) thereunder, and that the Commission violated Section 5 of the Commission's Rules of Practice.  According to the complaint, the Commission improperly relied on prior unsubstantiated, unfounded, or withdrawn complaints to determine whether an officer was entitled to disciplinary action against him or her.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as alleged in the Commission&rsquo;s public memorandum and motion papers filed in the United States District Court in Manhattan on February 14, 2018 and unsealed on August 2, 2018 in the same case, the Commissioner of Police has the right to revoke or suspend an officer's officer-on-officer disciplinary order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint Resolution, the Board and Davie consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) and (3) and 10(b)(5) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgments also order the Commission to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be imposed by the court upon the Commission and the District Attorney's Office. The Commission also agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval. The complaint also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions against future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and a conduct-based injunction against further violations of Section 5(b).  The Commission has agreed to settle the case against it by consenting to a judgment that enjoins it from violating these provisions and orders it to conduct an independent investigation of all allegations of misconduct by the Commission, including those arising from alleged misconduct by officers in the Department of Justice, the Internal Affairs Bureau, and the Police Department. The settlements are subject to a court order requiring a hearing and a hearing before the Commission could determine whether to proceed with an investigation. The proposed settlement is pending final approval by the Court.  On August 9, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Davie for violating Section 5"
