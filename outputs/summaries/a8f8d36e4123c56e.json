  "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against SolarCity Corporation, its former COO, and two former CFOs in connection with an accounting error that caused the company's stock price to plummet.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that SolarCity and COO Peter Rive made a series of misstatements and omissions in its financial statements in the months leading up to and after the company went public in 2012.  According to the complaint, Rive and Kelly knew that the company was not profitable and that it needed a successful IPO to fund capital expenditures and strategic acquisitions.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Rive, Kelly, and another CFO, Tanguy Serra, made material misrepresentations to investors about the profitability of the sales division and the company as a whole.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed on March 28, 2014, SolarCity's financial statements for the first quarter of 2012 and the second quarter of 2013, were materially overstated.  SolarCity reported a net loss of $91.575 million in 2012, even with the accounting error, and reported a profit of $113.726 million in the third quarter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint and the facts of the matter, Rives and Kelly consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $13.3 million, plus prejudgment interest of $6.7 million, and to pay a civil penalty of $20,000.  Rive also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and Kelly agreed to a five-year bar from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Separately, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Rive.  On May 24, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Rives, Kelly and Serra.   The complaint also names Zucco Partners, LLC, a direct-to-consumer marketer and member of the board of directors of SolarCity, as a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b-2, and 13b"
