  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a former release-of-information specialist and her co-conspirator in connection with an identity theft scheme.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, Tanganica Corbett and Kevin Weaver II worked at Florida Hospital, where Corbett was a release-and-release specialist. The complaint alleges that Corbett stole patients' \"face sheets\" without authorization and sold them to Weaver, who used the information to open credit card accounts and commit other forms of identity fraud. Corbett also allegedly used the patients\u2019 information to steal credit card numbers and to commit other fraudulent identity-theft schemes. The SEC alleges that, contrary to what the court held, Corbett violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(A)(i). Corbett has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $232,068.64. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Lejarde-Rada and Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Health and Human Services."
