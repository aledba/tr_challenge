  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Debelbots, who were convicted of malice murder for the death of their infant daughter, McKenzy Debelbot.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order halting the defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial.  According to the court\u2019s order, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio on June 2, 2008, the defendants raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel when they filed motions for new trial in 2009, raising general grounds and asserting that their respective trial attorneys were constitutionally ineffective in failing to provide reasonable assistance to the defendants.  In its order, the court found that all of the evidence presented to the jury was insufficient to determine whether the defendants were liable for malice murder.  Specifically, it found that none of the expert testimony was credible, and neither Albert nor Ashley offered a rebuttal to the claims of the state.  As a result, the jury could not determine whether Albert or Ashley were liable as a party to the crime based on reasonable doubt or whether they had acted reasonably under the circumstances of the case.  Without more precise credibility and credibility, we are unable to conduct a meaningful prejudice analysis.  For example, the judge who presided over the trial found that Albert and Ashley violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On the same day, the trial court issued a short order denying the defendants relief, ordering them to return to the United States, and ordering the destruction of any evidence that may have been relevant to the cause of death.   The SEC also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against Albert, Ashley, and Darren Debelbatts, who each consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a $50,000 penalty, with the amount of any civil penalty to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion-for-new-trial motion.  Additionally, the order prohibits the defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  To resolve the SEC case, the defendant must show that he or she has sufficient experience and qualifications to be a reasonable person."
