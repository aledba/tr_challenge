  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against the City of Chicago in a civil case brought by the Chicago Police Department.  The court's order, which entered a temporary restraining order against the city and its officers, permanently enjoins the city from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the city to pay $44.7 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In its order, the court also granted the city's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, the city failed to inform the jury that it had a history of failing to discipline officers who committed misconduct.  As alleged in the complaint, the City also failed to adequately and accurately record its failures to discipline its officers.  For example, the complaint alleges that the city did not adequately or accurately record certain of its officers' actions in the five years leading up to the January 2010 shooting.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Chicago consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations, ordering a permanent injunction, and imposing a civil penalty of $44,724. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Chicago Office of Inspector General. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
