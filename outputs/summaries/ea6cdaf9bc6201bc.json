  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Cresta Bella, LP, a public school district that imposed school impact fees on new residential development.  According to the court's order, Crestaella filed a complaint in August 2008 alleging that the District improperly charged fees for new residential construction because the District did not evaluate whether preexisting square footage in new residential units impacts school facilities by increasing student population.  The complaint further alleged that the district failed to consider whether the additional square footage generated by the new development was a reasonable relationship between the costs of new school construction and the need for new school facilities.  As alleged in the complaint, the District's imposition of the school impact fee was unreasonable because it did not consider whether any of the pre-existing square footage contributed to an increase in student enrollment.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the school district's failure to impose the fee on the new construction resulted in a partial refund of $1,004,277.41 in excess fees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court order, the district consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and imposing a $3.89 per square foot fee on existing residential units in the district.\u00c2\u00a0The district also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws and to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a penny stock bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1. \u00c2\u00a0On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Deborah M. Welshhans entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the District from violating these provisions and orders it to pay an $8,307,987 civil penalty and a $14,000 civil penalty.  On May 26, 2020, the court entered a temporary restraining order and ordered the District to comply with the Court's order and pay a $2.4 million civil penalty, which is equal to a $9,259,777 civil penalty imposed by the court.  Additionally, on May 25, 2018 the court ordered the district to provide an accounting of the costs associated with the new residential project and to provide a \"reasonable relationship test\" to determine whether the fee complied with the statutory reasonable relationship standard.
