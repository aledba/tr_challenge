  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against defendant Rwoeshan Booker on consent for his participation in a second-degree felony assault.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, alleges that, on January 28, 2013, Mr. Booker entered a guilty plea for the class B felony of first degree assault in the first degree. According to the complaint, he was with the other four individuals in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant when Mr. Lane confronted him and tried to stop him from acting as an accomplice in committing the first-degree assault. The complaint further alleges that he was not present during the entire sequence of events and did not engage in any physical contact with the individual. Instead, the complaint alleges, he engaged in a verbal altercation with one of the other defendants, who also engaged in the verbal altercation. The SEC alleges, however, that, based on the evidence presented to the court, Booker was not guilty of the charged felony and was not liable to be charged as a principal or accomplice. Rather, the SEC alleges that the defendants acted together in striking A.A. on June 20, 2010, and their conduct was not knowing and voluntary and that his plea counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him he had a viable defense to the second degree assault that was the subject of the plea.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Booker.  On March 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the SEC to conduct a parallel criminal investigation. The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Mr. McClellan and Ms. Dolan and supervised by Amy C. McKinley."
