  "summary": "On April 12, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a default judgment against Toiny LLC, a Brooklyn, New York-based real estate agent, and its co-defendant, John Does 1 through 12 (the \u201cJohn Doe defendants\u201d) pursuant to New York Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law (\u201cRPAPL\u201d).  Toiny filed a second motion for default judgment on June 26, 2016, against Lindsay, alleging that Lindsay made no payments towards principal and that he owed $14,299.89 in interest over the 20-month period.  According to Toiny's second motion, filed on June 25, 2018, Toiny amended its default judgment to add $113,976.01 of principal to the amount owed to Lindsay.  The amended default judgment, which the court granted in part and denied in part, requires Toiny to provide the full history of Lindsay's payments, including the amount of principal owed to him, as well as the status of any tenant currently occupying the premises, including whether plaintiff has served the tenant's current obligations as a result of the default judgment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the amended motion, the court agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Toiny from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the court to determine whether Toiny is entitled to disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.  In a parallel action, On March 30, 2019, the Honorable Kiyo A. Matsumoto of the New York District Court issued an order granting Toiny a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of Toiny and Toiny, and imposing a civil penalty of $150,000.  On April 5, 2019 the court issued a report and recommendation recommending that Toiny be barred from appearing before the court as an attorney or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review of the litigation that was conducted by the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.
