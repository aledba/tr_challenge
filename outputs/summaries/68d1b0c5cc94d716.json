  "summary": "On May 22, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against Carlos Alberto Fuentes-Canales, Jr., a former resident of El Salvador, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The court found that, as alleged in the complaint filed in federal court in Herrold, Texas, the defendant had committed generic burglary of a habitation, an offense that did not qualify for purposes of generic burglary.  According to the complaint, however, as a predicate for the defendant\u2019s entry into the United States, he had a prior felony burglary conviction, which resulted in a 16-level enhancement to his base offense level.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in the course of his criminal history, he entered the home without permission and with no right to be on the premises.  As alleged, he pressed three of his kitchen knives against his abdomen and threatened to kill his mother.  After the court entered its final judgment, the court held that the defendant did not commit the generic burglary, but instead engaged in a \"permanent and fact-intensive\" inquiry to determine whether he had committed a generic burglary and whether he should be sentenced to a prison term that is more than \"necessary\" to fulfill the purposes of the sentencing guidelines.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $75,000.  On May 24, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a temporary restraining order, an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice."
