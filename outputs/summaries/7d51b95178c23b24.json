  "summary": "On December 8, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Armando Enrique Delgado, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for engaging in the same conduct.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Armando participated in a scheme to transport a minor for prostitution.  According to the complaint, Armando and two co-defendants, Antonio Delgado and Anthony D'Ambrosio, engaged in the scheme.  Armando alleges that Delgado drove to Florida for a mid-trial interview with Keanu Martinez, who later testified at trial for the government.  Delgado allegedly told the jury that he was a \"body guard\" and \"ride with\" the victims.  He also allegedly told one of the victims that she \"might have went to Maryland\" with Armando.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1591(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder, and ordering Armando to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Additionally, the court granted Armando's motion for a temporary restraining order against further violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Delgado for his role in a related scheme involving the sale and purchase of unregistered securities in connection with the purchase and sale of securities of a public company.  This case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office, with assistance from Eric R. Werner of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit, and Patrick J. McCluskey of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
