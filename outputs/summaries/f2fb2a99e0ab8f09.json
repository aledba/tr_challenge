  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming on September 5, 2017 entered a final judgment against a defendant in a child support case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, alleges that Arsenio Lemus (Father) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 20-2-303 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from August 2016 through September 2017, Father filed a petition in the district court to establish child custody, visitation, and child support for his two children, JAL (born in 2006) and AKL (in 2011).  The complaint alleges that Father failed to provide sufficient information to the court about the nature of his business income and how it impacted the child support determination.  In a parallel action, on September 6, 2017, the Honorable Joseph G. Dugan granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Father to comply with the court\u2019s order.  Dugan also agreed to be enjoined from violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws, and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a court order requiring him to pay child support.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Father consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to repay the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.   The court also ordered that Father pay a civil penalty of $7,030, which is equal to the amount owed to him by the parties in the complaint.  Father agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction, agreeing to pay a $2,500 civil penalty, and agreeing to an officer-and-director bar.  He also agreed not to participate in any pre-judgment hearing on child support related to the issue of his income and to the appointment of a receiver for his or her family's use of the funds.  On September 7, 2018, the court issued an order requiring Father to provide a financial affidavit, which he did not do, and ordered him to provide.  As a result of the court order, Father was barred from appearing before the SEC as an attorney or practicing before the Commission on Family and Children, and from appearing as an individual or as a director of a public company.  Additionally, Father did not provide any documentation verifying his employment income, such as pay stubs or W-2 forms.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-20-"
