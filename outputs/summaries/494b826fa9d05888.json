  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against defendant Nathan Alan Montgomery, Jr., finding him liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that, in 2015, Montgomery and a co-worker were married for several years and had a volatile, contentious relationship. According to the complaint, Montgomery allegedly forced the victim to perform oral sex and to have sexual intercourse with him and placed a pillow over her face to induce her to suffocate. The complaint further alleges that Montgomery used a character witness to corroborate the victim\u2019s account of the attack, which he described as a \u201cman of integrity.\u201d The complaint alleges that the trial court erred in finding that Montgomery intentionally placed his general good character in issue and thus opened the door for the prosecution to cross-examine the witness about specific instances of Montgomery's conduct reflecting bad character.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Montgomery. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The case is being handled by Paul S. Milich, Paul E. Colangelo, and Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. McKinley."
