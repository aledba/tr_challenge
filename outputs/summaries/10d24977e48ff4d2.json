  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against Dominique Mack, a convicted felon who was sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiracy to commit witness tampering by first-degree murder, in violation of the federal securities laws.  The court also found that Mack violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1512(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Mack also was found liable under Rule 804(b)(3) for his participation in a conspiracy to murder Charles Jernigan.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Connecticut, Mack was indicted on September 15, 2010, along with 32 others, and was convicted of two felony counts of witness tampering related to the death of Francis.  As alleged in the complaint, Mack conspired to murder Francis in order to avoid being sentenced to the mandatory minimum of life imprisonment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mack arising from the same conduct.  To resolve the SEC\u2019s case, Mack has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, Mack also agreed to be enjoined from participating in any future solicitation of the purchase, sale, offer, or promotion of any firearm, and to be restrained from associating with any person who is not a registered representative of the company or which is not registered to sell or offer a firearm.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  This case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Connecticut Department of Justice in this matter."
