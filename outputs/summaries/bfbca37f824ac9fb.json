  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Citi Financial Inc., a now-defunct Ohio-based mortgage servicer, for failing to timely respond to a class action complaint filed by Karen Rimmer in 2005.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 25, 2006, Rimmer, then a resident of Lakewood, Ohio, raised the issue of class certification by alleging that Citi failed to timely file an entry of satisfaction of mortgage with the county recorder in violation of the federal securities laws.  The complaint further alleged that, in addition to failing to respond to Rimmer's request for class certification, Citi did not timely file arbitration with the court.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, among the 5,254 loans that Rimmer paid off in full but for whom Citi had excluded while introducing arbitration, only 275 individuals fit the class definition.  Rimmer also claimed that, as a result of Citi's failure to timely comply with all prior discovery requests, the class members were not included in the final judgment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court granted Rimmer a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the classifications.  On August 13, 2016, the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of Rimmer and ordered Citi to provide an accounting of the class and to pay $27,500 in attorney fees, to be subtracted from the total judgment amount of $68,750.  Finally, on December 11, 2018, a federal district court in Ohio issued an order granting class certification to all persons who had entered into a residential mortgage agreement with Citi without having signed an arbitration agreement.   The court's order granted the class certification without providing an accounting, and, on July 5, 2017, a trial court in Dayton, Ohio issued a judgment ordering the class to be certified within 90 days of the date of satisfaction.  This court also issued a preliminary injunction against Rimmer from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Chicago Regional Office.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5:"
