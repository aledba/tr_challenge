  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Puerto Rico today announced criminal charges against a Puerto Rican man accused of stealing an AM-15 multi-caliber assault rifle.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Puerto Rico, alleges that on February 23, 2017, a federal district court in San Juan, Puerto Rico issued an arrest warrant for Jos\u00e9 Francisco Rodr\u00edguez-Reyes for possession of a firearm in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 3553(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  According to the complaint, the arrest warrant was dismissed on a motion by the district court, and the sentence imposed was longer than necessary for an upward departure from the federal sentencing recommendation.

It also ordered him to comply with the court's order to surrender the weapon of his choice, which was deemed reasonable by the court at the time of the sentencing hearing.  To learn more about pre-judgment discretion, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 596 (1st Cir. 2010).  The complaint also alleges that, in a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has issued an order appointing an independent receiver to determine whether a defendant has a history of drug use and a prior conviction, and that the receiver will determine the appropriate amount of restitution to be paid based on the determination of the receiver.
