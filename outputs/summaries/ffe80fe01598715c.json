  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon today announced criminal charges against two Oregon men accused of driving while under the influence of intoxicants.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that, in 2010, the Oregon Attorney General's Office issued an arrest warrant for a defendant who had previously been convicted of DUII in violation of the federal criminal laws.  According to the complaint, the defendant was charged by the Attorney General with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the federal securities laws Section 17(a)(1) and (3)(b)(3) of Securities Act of 1933.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant had prior convictions for DUII, including a 2015 Kansas conviction, and that he had been previously convicted in a similar criminal case.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these federal statutes, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the United States.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Office of International Affairs. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Oregon Department of Justice in this matter."
