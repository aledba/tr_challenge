  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a Texas man who was convicted of two felony counts of attempted capital murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that, on April 9, 2013, Patrick Harrison, then a student at Lone Star College, engaged in a series of unprovoked attacks on two other students, Carl Babineaux and Carol Baca, who were also injured.  According to the complaint, Harrison allegedly used a pocket knife to stab the two students, who had been in class with him at the time of the attacks.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Harrison and Baca were injured in the attacks, and Harrison sustained severe injuries.  Harrison allegedly had a history of obsessive-compulsive disorder and had been diagnosed with schizophrenia.  He was sentenced to 48 years and 20 years in prison, with the remainder to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against Harrison, alleging that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, LLC, and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Harrison consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000.  On August 30, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Conrrad granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order against Harrison and ordered him to be enjoined from future securities law violations.  A hearing for Harrison was scheduled for September 5, 2017.  Judge Conrrod will consider the merits of the case upon motion by the SEC.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Office of Inspector General in this matter."
