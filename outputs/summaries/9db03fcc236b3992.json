  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska today entered a default judgment against Sarah C. Cullen, a registered nurse, and her employer, La Petite Academy, Inc., in a wrongful death action brought by the Bells.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Omaha, Nebraska, alleges that, from January 2013 through February 2014, Sullivan and his wife, Ashley C. Bell, hired a nanny to provide in-home care for Cash Bell. The complaint alleges that while working for Sullivan and Ashley, the childcare centers failed to report suspected child abuse or neglect by Cullen, and Cullen failed to do so, the complaint alleges, because Cullen had more experience working as a childcare provider and failed to disclose the alleged misconduct to authorities.  According to the complaint, after learning of the allegations in the Sullivan and Bells\u2019 complaint, Cullen continued to abuse the children in her care, causing the children to fall to the ground.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Cullen.  Sullivan and her wife have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Sullivan from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Sullivan to pay disgorgement of $5,125,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $500,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The complaint also names Sullivan as a defendant in a parallel criminal action. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, the Nebraska Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
