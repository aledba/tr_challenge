  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Garden Fresh Restaurant Corporation (Garden Fresh), a former employer of Garden Fresh, for claims related to a variety of alleged Labor Code violations.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, Garden Fresh agreed to a class-and-representative arbitration agreement in which it agreed to pay certain of the parties' class and/or representative claims.  The complaint alleges that the parties agreed to class and representative arbitration based on two arbitration agreements that they had signed during their employment.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the arbitration agreements did not contemplate class or representative arbitration, and instead required the parties to submit their individual claims to an arbitrator to determine whether the parties had agreed to arbitration.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to arbitration on an individual basis only, and the court ultimately granted Garden Fresh's request for a writ of mandamus, a temporary restraining order, and a preliminary injunction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained a court order halting the litigation.  On March 24, 2019, the Honorable Paul G. Stolt-Nielsen of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) entered a judgment ordering the issuance of a permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered that the court determine whether to order arbitration of all of the defendants' claims on a joint, multi-level basis.  Additionally, the court ordered Garden Fresh to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion by the parties.  Finally, the Court issued an order requiring the arbitration agreement to be accompanied by a copy of the final judgment, which was entered by a majority of the court.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by John W. Sansone and supervised by Marc Blau of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Eric R. Gottschall and Glenn S. Gordon. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the California Office of the Attorney General."
