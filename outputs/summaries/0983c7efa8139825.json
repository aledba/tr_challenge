  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment in favor of a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for improper venue.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that defendants James Donohue and Dryshod, LLC began negotiations to license Haas' popular Mossy Oak Break-Up camouflage pattern for apparel produced by dryshod. At some point, the defendants decided to create their own pattern rather than licensing those owned by Haas. According to the complaint, however, this pattern and mark was intended to confuse customers into believing they were buying the products from the distributors. The complaint further alleges that the defendants and their distributors did not share profits from the sale of the allegedly infringing products. The court found that, contrary to Haas' claims, the Defendants and the distributors acted as a \"sourcing agent\" for unaffiliated distributors by designing apparel and then finding manufacturers to produce the apparel, which is sold directly from the manufacturer to the distributor. The Court found that the Defendants violated the registration provisions of the federal securities laws and the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Haas has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. Haas has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court granted limited discovery on the jurisdictional issues and ordered a temporary restraining order and a hearing to determine whether to transfer the case to a district court in the district of Texas. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Mississippi, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
