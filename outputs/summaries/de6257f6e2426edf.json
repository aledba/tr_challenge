  "summary": "On June 21, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Snohomish County, N.Y., for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, Washington, alleges that the Board improperly granted the County's request to revoke an exemption to acquire or operate a freight rail easement over the county's property.  According to the complaint, the Board's decision to revoke the exemption was arbitrary and capricious.  In its final judgment, the court found that the County had failed to consider whether the notices of exemption were independently misleading, and that it could not determine whether the Board had been misled by the representations in its initial order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's initial order, the County consented to the entry of a final Judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The final judgment also prohibits the County from issuing or denying a motion to revoke its exemption, and orders the County to submit a second petition for review, which is subject to court approval, to be filed in the District of Columbia on the same day the Commission issued its initial Order.  On May 17, 2020, the District Court entered an order granting the County a temporary restraining order and ordering it to comply with the court's order, which requires the Commission to determine whether it has jurisdiction over the matter at a later date.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 527, 532-34 (D.C. Cir. 1998).  The Commission's order also requires that the Commission consider whether a person, class of persons, or a transaction or service exemption is necessary to carry out a fair and efficient regulatory process.  Specifically, the order requires that a party seeking to acquire a common carrier railroad, such as a Class II or Class III rail line, submit an application that provides information about itself and its proposed use of the line, including operational, financial, environmental, and energy data.  It also requires the Board to provide a copy of the initial Order to any party who wishes to file a complaint for review with the Commission.  Finally, the Commission has agreed to a preliminary injunction and to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining the Commission from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission has also agreed to the appointment of an independent receiver to oversee the operation of the common carrier rail."
