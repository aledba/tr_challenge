  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Chaka Fattah, Sr., a Philadelphia resident, for orchestrating a scheme to steal millions of dollars from two Philadelphia-area candidates.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on May 16, 2016, alleges that, while serving as a member of the Philadelphia Regional Office, FATTAH solicited the assistance of a political consultant in Washington, D.C., to secure the appointment of a United States Ambassador to the United States.  According to the complaint, after learning of the potential conflict of interest in the federal district court for the District of Columbia, FattAH and his associate, Herbert Vederman, agreed to settle the matter by agreeing to pay $1 million in interest and a $100,000 penalty.

He also issued a cease-and-desist order, ordering the issuance of an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation, and ordering the destruction of any evidence that may have been obtained in the course of the litigation.  A hearing for the receiver was scheduled for 10:30 a.m. on June 30, 2017.  Judge Bartles ordered the receiver to send a copy of the subpoena to the receiver, who would receive it from the receiver.  After the receiver received the subpoena, the jury deliberated for approximately four hours, concluding that it was unlikely that the receiver would comply with the subpoena.  Instead, the receiver sent a blank bill of sale for a $600,000 loan to a private company that paid for the loan, which was never repaid.
