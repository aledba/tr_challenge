  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a trustee of a San Antonio-area produce-distribution business for defrauding his wife.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Austin, Texas, alleges that, shortly before filing for bankruptcy in February 2014, Curtis DeBerry opened a joint bank account with his sister-in-law, Kathy DeBerry. According to the complaint, DeBerry allegedly wanted to use the account to transfer money to her children, who were away at school at the time. The complaint also alleges that DeBerry showed her only the signature pages when she asked her for a refund. The court agreed that the trustee is entitled to only a single satisfaction, not a positive grant of recovery power or entitlement to subsection (a) recoveries under the bankruptcy code. The SEC also agreed that, based on the SEC's findings, the trustee cannot \"recover\" the bank account without first recovering the property or the value thereof. In addition, the court found that the transfer was avoidable because DeBerry was removing herself from the account and did not receive the satisfaction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against DeBerry for his role in the alleged scheme.  According to court documents filed in the SEC case unsealed on May 7, 2019, the SEC charged DeBerry with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of Securities Act Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the Trustee consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $241,500 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000. The judgment also orders DeBerry to pay a $75,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  DeBerry agreed to the judgment, which also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future without first obtaining a court order. DeBerry also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to a five-year officer and director bar. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, Patricia M. Wald, and Glenn S. Kasper of the Chicago Regional Office."
