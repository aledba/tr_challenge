  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Dustin Ash, a Kansas City, Missouri man convicted of second-degree robbery.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Ash violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Ash was convicted in 2012 of a felony that required the use of physical force to overcome victim resistance.  Ash pled guilty to a felony for a similar crime in 2001 and was sentenced to one year of probation.  As alleged, Ash's criminal history included a 2012 Kansas conviction for reckless aggravated battery, a 2001 Missouri conviction for second- degree robbery, and a 2001 robbery conviction.   The complaint further alleges Ash had at least two prior convictions for crimes of violence: his Kansas conviction, which was affirmed in part by the court, and his 2001 Missouri robbery conviction, that Ash had a prior conviction for, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In addition, the court ruled that Ash's Kansas conviction qualifies as a \"crime of violence\" because it requires the defendant to overcome the resistance of the victim, and Ash's 2001 Missouri criminal conviction was deemed sufficient to justify an enhanced sentence under the elements clause of the securities laws for Ash.

Additionally, Ash consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer and director bar, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years, from participating in any type of criminal activity, including securities law enforcement, from purchasing, selling, or offering a security deposit in the name of a company or company, from committing a felony, from acquiring or selling any security deposit, to participating in a public offering of a penny stock, to purchasing or selling an investment in a private company, to the extent that he was able to afford it at the time of the purchase or sale of the penny stock.  This order also prohibits Ash from associating with any third-party law violator with"
