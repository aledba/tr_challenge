  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against the City of Allentown, Pennsylvania, on consent for summary judgment in a civil injunctive action brought by the Pension Board in 2013.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on April 17, 2013, Aurelio Bonilla, a former police officer with the city, filed a complaint in the Philadelphia District Court alleging that the city violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that Bonilla failed to adequately supervise the city's response to his pension application, and that the City's response was premature.  The complaint also alleges that, in a parallel action, the city and the pension board denied Bonilla's pension application because they did not have sufficient evidence to show that he was totally disabled.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Bonilla consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his pension benefit. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services."
