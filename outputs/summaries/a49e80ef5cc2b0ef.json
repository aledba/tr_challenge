  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Paulson Papillon, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for orchestrating a series of high-level insider trading schemes.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in October 2015, Papillon sold drugs to M.P. and offered a bounty for his capture.  According to the complaint, after Papillon was arrested and jailed for his involvement in the alleged scheme, the defendant and his co-conspirator, Nathanial Smith, agreed to settle the charges by agreeing to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Papillon to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Papillon.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Mascianica of the United States District Court in Manhattan granted the SEC's request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, and entered an order freezing Papillon's assets, including his bank accounts, and ordering him to pay a $2,500 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the federal district court in Manhattan, the SEC also issued an order suspending Papillon from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert in any matter involving the subject matter of a criminal trial.  To settle the case, the court also ordered Papillon and Smith to pay civil penalties of $500,000 each, and ordered Younge to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000, which is equal to the penalty imposed by the court on Papillon in the earlier criminal case.   The court's order also imposed a $50,000 bar on Papillion. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David A. Kasper and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the FBI in this matter."
