  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against a juvenile probation officer for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the probation officer who performed the cheek swab.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, Ismael Casillas, then a juvenile, entered into a stipulated, one-year deferred adjudication for drug possession. Casillas successfully completed the terms of his deferred adjudicated and was subsequently sentenced to six years of probation. The complaint alleges that Casillas failed to comply with the court's order to suppress the evidence derived from the officer's unauthorized collection of Casillas's DNA, which was later found to be an unreasonable search and seizure.  Casillas was later convicted of criminal mischief for his role in a carjacking.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Casillas. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Denver Regional Office and the case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by David A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Hershfang.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Department of Justice, and the Colorado Office of Criminal Investigations."
