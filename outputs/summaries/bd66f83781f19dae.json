  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against Merz North America, Inc. (\"Merz\"), a North Carolina-based medical device manufacturer, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The court also entered a temporary restraining order halting Merz's pending litigation against Doyle.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Boston, Doyle worked for Merz as a saleswoman from September 2015 through May 2018, and was based in Massachusetts when she was transferred to the company's injectables division.  The complaint alleges that Doyle was harassed by Patten, Floegel, and other Merz employees while she was working in Massachusetts.  Doyle also alleges that Patten refused to support her in the same way he did male team members and, specifically, that he would not co-travel with her to visit with Massachusetts clients.  In addition, Doyle alleges that she was criticized for making only two sales to Massachusetts clients, and once she complained about this unequal treatment, Patten allegedly called her and told her that she \"was playing the game\" with other men on the team.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Doyle consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars her from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On May 25, 2018, the court granted a preliminary injunction against Doyle and ordered her to return to Massachusetts to continue her work in the division. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Compliance and Assessments by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Ryba and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (March 21, 2018).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.K. Attorney's Office for the District of North Carolina, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office."
