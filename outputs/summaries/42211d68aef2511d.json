  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on August 10, 2016 entered final judgments against Adeline N. Porter, a former employee of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations, for her participation in a fraudulent scheme to re-open her workers' compensation claims.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Hawai'i, Porter raised the issue of whether or not she was entitled to relief for her claims for multiple chemical sensitivity related injuries. The complaint alleges that, contrary to the representations made in the complaint, Porter failed to show substantial evidence to support her claims, and the court found that Porter was not entitled to the same presumption under HRS \u00a7 386-89(c) that she had provided in her 2002 claims. In addition, the complaint alleged that Porter had not presented substantial evidence in support of Porter's 2002 claims and that the LIRAB had not acted as a reasonable broker-dealer to determine whether Porter's claims were worth reopening.  The complaint further alleges that the court did not err in its decision not to grant Porter's request for relief because Porter had provided the requisite showing of substantial evidence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Porter. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that Porter violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Porter consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Porter has also agreed to a bifurcated settlement where she will be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of ten years. The court also granted Porter's motion for a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rules 5b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder. The final judgment also prohibits Porter from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after five years."
