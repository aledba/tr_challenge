  "summary": "On March 28, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia entered a final judgment against Golden Eagle Resources, II, L.L.C., an oil and gas company, and its owner, Willow Run Energy, LLC (\u201cWillow Run\u201d). The court found that Golden Eagle and Willow Run violated the antifraud provisions of the federal and state arbitration laws. The court also ruled that the parties had a right to submit arbitration of pendent arbitrable claims when they had agreed to arbitration. According to the court's order, the parties agreed to submit to arbitration a total of 220.5 net acres of mineral interests that would be resolved by the court at a later date. However, the court ruled that Willow Run and Golden Eagle had breached the arbitration provision, and therefore could not be compelled to participate in an arbitration proceeding.  The court's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins Golden Eagle from participating in any arbitration proceeding and orders the parties to pay $537,597.38 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the parties' fees.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of West Virginia today announced criminal charges against Willow Run. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Charleston, West Virginia, charges Golden Eagle with violating the federal, state, and local securities laws and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgements of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The complaint also charges Willow Run with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a preliminary injunction, an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, and an officer and director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Golden Eagle consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering it to comply with the court\u2019s order, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against any future violations of the charged provisions. The settlement is pending final approval by the SEC.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Virginia Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Virginia Attorney General's Office in this matter."
