  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Wyoming today announced criminal charges against a Wyoming man accused of causing the death of a 3-year-old child.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Wyoming, alleges that Joseph J. Nielsen, a licensed clinical pathologist, provided expert testimony to a jury in a case involving child abuse.  According to the complaint, the jury was told that the child had suffered severe head injuries and that he had been injured in a fall from a coffee table. The complaint further alleges that the jury could not determine whether or not Nielsen had caused the child\u2019s death because he had not performed an autopsy since 2011. The SEC alleges that, contrary to what the jury believed, Nielsen had suffered a serious head injury and had been falsely told that his injuries were caused by \"non-accidental trauma.\" The complaint also alleges that Nielsen had been precluded from testifying as an expert in the field of forensic pathology because he was not knowledgeable with respect to matters involving commerce in cocaine. In addition, the complaint alleges that Mr. Nielsen had failed to disclose to the jury that he suffered a severe head injury that resulted in his death.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Nielsen that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Nielsen, which is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Nielsen consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to comply with the court's order, and imposing a $10,000 civil penalty. The final judgment also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any medical device, including an MRI or CT scan, without the knowledge or consent of the jury. The order also prohibits Nielsen from providing expert testimony in the form of an opinion, including one that he agreed to. The Court also ordered Nielsen to pay a $1,500 civil penalty and ordered him to be restrained from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Wyoming Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
