  "summary": "On January 14, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia entered a temporary restraining order against two men accused of orchestrating a long-running sexual assault.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Eric Reyes and Andy Carcamo violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to provide sufficient evidence to support their motion for a new trial.  According to the complaint, in November 2014, the victim and her twin sister were celebrating their twenty-first birthdays with friends in the downtown area of Savannah, Georgia when they were confronted by a private detective who questioned Reyes about his role in the alleged rape. The complaint alleges that the detective confronted Reyes about the alleged crime and confronted him about it, telling him that he had \"probable cause to believe that the victim had been in trouble because she had been drinking before she turned 21.\"  The complaint further alleges that, when confronted by the detective, Reyes replied, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t think so.\u201d  He also allegedly told the detective that he was going to search the victim\u2019s car and find any evidence of a crime, and that he did not force the victim to have sex with him while he was in the car.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Georgia today announced criminal charges against Reyes arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively. The SEC also instituted an asset freeze against the defendants, and the defendants agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Reyes also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of any company or entity that requires such a security deposit. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 17, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Reyes, charging him with violating Section 17a(a)(1) of The Securities Act, Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Section 10b-5, and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The court granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section"
