  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Rex Venture Group, LLC d/b/a www.ZeekRewards.com, a now-defunct online auction business, for failing to adequately represent the interests of its members.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, in 2011, Rex Venture, LLC, a private, invitation-only Affiliate advertising division of Zeek, offered participants the opportunity to participate in a Ponzi scheme by purchasing VIP bids. According to the complaint, these investors were net losers, receiving less money than they paid into Zeek and losing approximately $822.9 million. The complaint further alleges that Edmundson had conflicting interests as class counsel and had potential conflicts of interest throughout his time as a class counsel.  In a parallel action, filed on February 28, 2014, the SEC charged Zeek with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, and civil penalties against the defendants.  On May 27, 2017, the court entered a consent order appointing class counsel under Rule 23(a)(4) and ordering the class counsel to be appointed at the time of certification. The consent order requires class counsel appointed by the court to represent the class members to the court at a time when they are most likely to be affected by litigation arising from litigation arising out of the same litigation.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, sale, or promotion of any class action. The court also granted class counsel the right to reapply as a defendant at a later date.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau. The litigation will be led by Mr. Rubenstein and Ms. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Illinois Attorney General's Office in this matter."
