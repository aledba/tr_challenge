  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment against Joel B. Laner and his firm, 63rd Street Enterprises, LLC, for fraudulently misrepresenting their business acumen and that their personal assets could finance the LLC investments.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 11, 2018, from May 11 through May 13, Laner, through his law firm, represented to plaintiff that he had secured, on the LLC's behalf, \"the assets and services of Mr. Marsden.\"  The complaint alleges that, at the time of the alleged misconduct, the defendants had not engaged in any business relationship with the LLC.  The SEC alleges that defendants' representations to plaintiff were false, misleading, and in violation of the fiduciary duties owed to the LLC and its members.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $200,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Laner.  On May 24, 2019, the court entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and barring them from further association with the company or its officers or directors, from participating in any derivative action.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-11-1273, July 24, 2014.  Separately, the SEC issued an order requiring defendants to show cause of action in a civil proceeding against each of them for violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, as well as the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and the books and records provision of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-1 thereunder. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. McCluskey and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Amy S. Cotter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Missouri Attorney General's Office."
