  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Vien T. Bui of Santa Clara, California, ordering him to pay a total of $257,807 in attorney fees.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 22, 2010, Bui filed a civil injunctive action against Hi-Tech Dental, Inc. (\"Hi-Tech\"), alleging that Bui violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1021.5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleged that, contrary to Bui's representations, the court improperly awarded Bui $150,000 of attorney fees based on the fact that he had no economic losses and the existing medical records contradicted his testimony.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  Bui also agreed to pay $126,974.13 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his attorney fees, and to be offset by a $50,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Bui arising from the same conduct alleged by the complaint.  On February 11, 2012, a federal district court in Los Angeles granted Bui a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and a penalty of $250,000.  At the same time, the district attorney's office issued an order suspending Bui from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau of the Los Angeles Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Karpel.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
