  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 21, 2019 entered a final judgment against Richard E. Span, Jr., a convicted felon, for his role in a drug ring that operated in the St. Stephens apartment complex on the west side of Chicago.  The court found that Span violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, Span conspired to distribute and possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine, 500 grams of cocaine powder, and 90 grams of heroin.  As alleged in the complaint, Span was responsible for more than 1 kilogram of crack and 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Span arising from his involvement in the drug ring.  Span has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Span has consented to permanent injunctions, to a conduct-based injunction, and to a bifurcated settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933.  On May 22, 2019, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Span and ordered him to surrender his passport and to return to the country where he was born.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David A. Curb, Mark L. Gibson, and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit, with assistance from John Rymas of the Enforcement Division's Analysis and Detection Center."
