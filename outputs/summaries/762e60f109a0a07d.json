  "summary": "On May 5, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio entered final judgments in favor of defendants Eric John Rosenberg, Esq., David T. Ball & Ball Co., LPA, and Frederick M. Gittes in a civil injunctive action brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against Rosenberg.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that Rosenberg violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Rosenberg failed to adequately represent to the trial court that he was entitled to summary judgment based on reasonable reliance on the representations of others in the case.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, despite Rosenberg's repeated efforts to convince the court to grant him summary judgment, he did not adequately represent his client's interests in the SEC's litigation.  As a result, Rosenberg was held to present only in the form of foregone settlement offers during the pendency of the first federal case and, in the event of a second federal case, would be limited to the amount of compensation that could be paid to appellant.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint or in the alternative, Rosenberg has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $250,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On May 26, 2016, the court granted summary judgment against Rosenberg and ordered him to comply with the court's order requiring him to provide expert testimony in support of his motion for summary judgment on all of the issues raised in the Commission's complaint and subsequent action.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David M. Ball, David Terry Ball, DeLibera, Lyons & Bibbo, and David Ball of Rosenberg & Ball, LPA. The litigation will be led by Enrique Seoane-Vazquez and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
