  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment in favor of the adoption of a biological child.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio on February 6, 2018, the court found that Ohio law requires the appointment of legal counsel to indigent parents in private adoption proceedings.  The complaint alleges that the court improperly granted the court-appointed counsel to an indigent mother for a period of one year immediately preceding the filing of her petition for adoption.  As alleged in the complaint, this violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the mother for her role in the alleged misconduct.  On February 9, 2017, a federal district court in Ohio issued an order granting temporary custody of L.C.C.'s biological father, who was later convicted of drug possession and sentenced to prison for a total of 17 years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the mother consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.   The court also granted the mother's request for a second assignment of error, which requires the court to determine whether to grant the child's legal representation and whether to issue an order appointing a lawyer for the mother.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2017.  This case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Ohio Division of Public Counsel Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Advocacy and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
