  "summary": "On June 18, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered final judgments against Younge, a former seasonal, part-time technician at a Philadelphia television station, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, alleges that, on May 7, 2008, younge was scheduled to train with Rick Schultz, an engineering technician at the Philadelphia Regional Office, when Schultz confronted him about his race and/or color. According to the complaint, Schultz replied, \u201c[W]hy are you training a hoop \u2018?\u201d  The complaint alleges that the station knew of Schultz\u2019s racial animus and disallowed him from participating in a final judgment on his behalf.  Schultz agreed to the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the District of Philadelphia today announced criminal charges against Schultz.  On June 17, 2016, the Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, and ordered the station to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The SEC also instituted an administrative proceeding against Younige, which was instituted by the court on May 15, 2008. The court's order, which is subject to court approval, ordered the company to provide a copy of the complaint to the Commission on Human Relations, which will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the Court upon motion of the Commission. The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting to the allegations, Youniaga has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations, and orders him to pay $250,000 in civil penalties and a $50,000 officer and director bar. The final judgment also orders Younaga to cooperate with the investigation that is being conducted by the Philadelphia Office of Financial Regulation, including the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and the Office of Compliance and Risk Management. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
