  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the National Security Agency (NSA) for unlawfully collecting and querying telephony metadata.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the NSA conducted a bulk collection of telephony data pursuant to Section 215 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in 2011.  According to the complaint, the bulk collection was conducted pursuant to a program designed to detect and prevent foreign terrorist activity.  As alleged, the program allowed the NSA to collect and analyze the phone and Internet metadata collected under Section 215.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of the program, defendants' communications were likely among those collected through the program.   The complaint further alleges that defendants failed to show sufficient evidence to support their claims that the program violated their First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendment rights.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 215, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  Finally, the court issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants' assets, and issuing an order requiring the destruction of any telephone metadata collected by the NSA. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice."
