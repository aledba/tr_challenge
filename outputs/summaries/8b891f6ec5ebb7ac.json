  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., alleges that the IRS improperly withheld agency records from CoA Institute, Inc., a non-profit strategic oversight group, in violation of Section 5(a)(4)(B) of the federal FOIA. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the IRS's representations to the court, the IRS failed to adequately consider the issues raised in the complaint, including whether or not the requested records qualify as \"agency records\" when, in fact, they are not subject to the agency's jurisdiction. In addition, the complaint alleges that a court could not determine whether the requested documents were agency records because the agency had not withheld them from the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against CoA.  According to the SEC's continuing investigation, which is continuing, the agency has filed a second complaint in the matter, this time against the IRS, alleging that it failed to comply with Rule 12(b)(5) and (c) thereunder, and that the agency is entitled to a judgment on the merits of the complaint against the agency.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the court has agreed to the entry of an order that permanently enjoins the IRS from violating the federal records laws, requires the agency to provide timely and accurate information, and imposes a $25,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 552 (4)(A) and Litigation Bulletin No. 624 (4th Cir. 2013).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Office of Inspector General. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Compliance in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages the public to check the background of anyone making a complaint by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Order\u00c2\u00a0requiring\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0the FBI and the Department of Justice\u00c2\u00a0will cooperate with the FBI in its investigation of the subject matter of a federal agency's FOIA request."
