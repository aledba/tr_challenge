  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee today entered a final judgment against The Coal Creek Company, a Tennessee-based oil and gas company, for failing to comply with the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Knoxville, Tennessee, alleges that, from 2009 through 2014, the company and its property assessors failed to adequately assess the value of the company's oil-and-gas interests.  According to the complaint, the assessors' methodology for valuing the property did not meet the statutory requirements.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the tax assessments on the property were not accurate and did not provide any evidence that the property was subject to taxation.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $122,742.59, $27,408, and $1,662, respectively, in the amount of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively.  On the same day, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Knox County, Tenn., charging the company with violations of Section 15(b)(5) and 16(a)(2) of Securities Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 16a-11 thereunder.   The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the Fort Worth Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Tennessee Division of Property Assessments, the Tennessee Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Tennessee Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
