  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a California attorney who filed an anti-SLAPP motion.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Tyler Ares, the adult son of a friend of Ares's, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 425 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, in 2008, appellant invested the assets in her home equity line of credit with Tyler Ares and promised that he would treat the assets as if they were his mother's assets and would not lose the assets under any circumstances.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the defendants did not safely and prudently invest the assets, and instead they lost her assets plus an amount that continues to accrue.

On August 7, 2012, the Los Angeles County Superior Court issued a temporary restraining order against Ares and ordered him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2,500.  At the same time, the court issued an order suspending Ares from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney in connection with a pending litigation action.  A hearing scheduled for September 5, 2012 is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Santa Clara County, California, charging Ares with defrauding an attorney who represented a fruit packing company against whom the apple growers had obtained judgment in a prior action. The complaint also charged Ares with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Section 15(a) of"
