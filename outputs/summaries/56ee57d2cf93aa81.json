  "summary": "On September 13, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against WTEF East, Inc. (\"WTEF\"), a nonprofit organization that raised nearly $8 million to construct a $10 million indoor tennis facility in Southeast Washington, D.C.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Va., on September 14, 2015, WTEf alleges that the court incorrectly concluded that the company had sufficient standing to assert its breach of contract and professional negligence claims in the Architect Agreement.  The court also found that WteF lacked standing to bring its claims under the contract because it was not a \"stranger\" to the construction of the facility.  In addition, the court found that, in light of the nature of the construction work, the company could not afford to delay the completion of the project.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants also failed to disclose that the contractor was on notice of the problems in the design of the East Capitol Campus when it requested the project to be completed.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, which was filed in the District Court in Alexandria on Sept. 13, 2015 and unsealed yesterday, the Court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the project, and a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's communications.  On September 20, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a preliminary injunction, an order requiring the receiver to comply with court orders, and the appointment of a receiver.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Mark Kost and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Department of Justice's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and the Office of the Chief Judge of the Northern District of Virginia."
