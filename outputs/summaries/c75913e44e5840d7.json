  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against Crown West Realty, LLC, a Washington, D.C.-based water supplier, in a water trust case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Spokane, Washington on September 20, 2016, Crown West claimed that its water right was for municipal water supply purposes.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the water right holder did not have a right to use the water for municipal use.  As alleged in the complaint, instead of using the water rights for municipal purposes, the property owner transferred it to a private water company for purposes unrelated to municipal water supplies.  In addition, the complaint alleges, as alleged, that Crown West failed to comply with the requirements of the federal water trust, which requires water suppliers to relinquish their water rights in five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the court also ordered Crown West to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and ordered the company to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $2,500.  Crown West also agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  On October 2, 2018, the Court granted the SEC and its investigation, which is continuing, the Commission's request for an asset freeze, a temporary restraining order, and an officer-and-director bar. The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by David A. Kasper and Ms. Basinger. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17, July 13, 2018."
