  "summary": "The Kentucky Authority for Educational Television (KET) today announced that it has obtained a final judgment against a former KET employee who was terminated for age and race discrimination.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Kentucky, alleges that Patrick J. Wise, a technician whose employment with KET was terminated in 2010, was the victim of age discrimination and awarded him back pay and other benefits.  According to the complaint, Wise was not interested in working on new digital equipment, had a bad attitude and had a poor work ethic.  KET's complaint alleges that the KET Personnel Board had jurisdiction over Wise\u2019s termination because he was not qualified to work on the new K-2 server.  In a parallel action, the Kentucky Office of Personnel Regulation (OPR) has issued an order requiring KET to comply with federal affirmative action rules.  On May 3, 2016, a hearing officer entered a recommended order finding that Wise was the last employee to be terminated as the result of age-related discrimination. The hearing officer found no evidence of discrimination with respect to Wise, and he recommended that Wise be dismissed without prejudice.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order, KET consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins KET from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. KET also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 civil penalty.  Additionally, the court granted KET a temporary restraining order against future violations of the federal securities laws and ordered it to conduct an independent examination of all of its employees to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support its findings.  A hearing officer agreed to a permanent injunction against further violations of these provisions and to the appointment of a new Personnel Board for KET employees. The court also granted the agency's request for an expedited hearing.  To learn more about age discrimination, see Litigation Release No. 18A.115(1)(f).
