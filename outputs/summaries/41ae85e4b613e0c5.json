The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Multnomah County, N.Y., alleges that, for approximately one year prior to the commitment hearing, appellant, as a result of his mental illness, was unable to meet his own basic health and safety needs and is a danger to others.  According to the complaint, during his last few days at MCDC, appellant was \"highly agitated\" and in restraints, and he repeatedly interrupted the proceedings by making statements that were highly aggressive and aggressive.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he was confrontational and made verbal threats and threatening gestures on a daily basis, including swinging his arms at other patients.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, that, in the past, when appellant was in custody, he had been brought back to the hospital a while ago and that he had refused to take medication or eat, but he continued to yell despite instructions to stop.  Finally, the court found that, despite repeated requests to be removed from the courtroom, appellant continued to be in restraints despite being told that he would not eat while in the jail, and, at one point, he apologized, stating that he \"did not have the bad judgment to act in ways that make people uncomfortable.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against appellant.
