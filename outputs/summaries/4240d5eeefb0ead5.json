  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Christopher R. Harris, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to life in prison for a second-degree felony murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Austin, Texas, alleges that Harris violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Harris consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Harris.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Harris violated Rule 404(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder, and the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Harris agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers\") and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the Advisers Advisers Rule of Evidence, which requires investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a security deposit.  Additionally, the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordered Harris to return to Texas and pay a civil penalty of $250,000, which is equal to the penalty imposed by the court.  On the same day, the SEC filed an emergency action against Harris, charging him with securities fraud and aiding and abetting his violations of Section 15(a)(1) and 16(a), and ordering him to disgorge $2,038, which he has already paid in cash, and pay in a civil proceeding.  To settle the SEC case, Harris has agreed to pay $1.5 million in restitution, and to a $50,000 penalty.  He also agreed to a five-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and to the appointment of a public accountant.  This settlement is subject to court approval.  Among other things, Harris pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud, and was sentenced at a later date"
