  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, on December 18, 2013, a physician's assistant provided testimony to a federal court in Manhattan regarding the severity of fibromyalgia, obesity, migraines, chronic pain syndrome, depression, bipolar disorder, eczema, and a heart block.  According to the complaint, this testimony was inconsistent with the evidence presented to the court.  For example, the complaint alleges that the complaint alleged that, although plaintiff claimed a disability onset date of December 2013, she did not seek medical treatment until February 2014, a mere two-month delay before receiving treatment.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Secretary of Health and Human Services today announced that it had issued a finding finding plaintiff not disabled under the federal disability laws and denying her benefits.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the SEC has agreed to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 13a-1 thereunder, and to the appointment of a receiver of the claimant's medical records.  To determine whether the receiver has reasonable grounds to discount the testimony, the court must determine whether it is reasonable to discount it.  Among other things, the Court must consider whether a medical doctor signed the opinion, whether claimant testimony or medical opinion, and whether further administrative proceedings would be useful.  On May 23, 2014, the Honorable Judge MaryKay R. Rauenzahn granted the SEC request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary asset freeze, and ordered the receiver to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver.  A hearing was held September 30, 2016, before the court for a hearing on the matter that was scheduled for 11:30 a.m. Eastern.   The court will consider the merits of the relief sought by the SEC in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Office of Inspector General, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
