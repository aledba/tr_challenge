  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of second-degree murder for his role in the February 2, 2014, shooting death of an elderly and unarmed friend.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbia, South Carolina, alleges that, in the days leading up to the Feb. 2 shooting, Fred Moss, Brandon Ratliff, and Andre Bunch visited the Cockpit Bar and Grill on Berryhill Road in Columbia. According to the complaint, Appellant and his friends confronted Fred about his use of a deadly weapon and told him to \"get down\" and \"scare away\" a car that had pulled up behind them. The complaint further alleges that as soon as Fred raised his hands to show he was unarmed, he fired at the car, causing the car to roll over and hit Fred, who was lying in the back seat of his car. As alleged, after Fred and Brandon left the bar and returned to Fred's car, the car they were riding in was stopped and the car was driven away. The court's final judgment, which permanently enjoins defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, orders defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of South Carolina today announced criminal charges against Appellants.  According to a press release from the SEC's Office of Criminal Investigations, which is investigating the case, Appelant and Bunch agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2019 (January 24, 2019)."
