  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming on May 10, 2014, entered a final judgment against a Wyoming man who was charged with defrauding a Wyoming jury in an on-again-off-again romantic relationship.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Wyoming on April 30, 2016, Jacob Alan Buszkiewic and Sarah A. Oakland were involved in an ongoing romantic relationship that began in April 2016. The complaint alleges that, in the course of their relationship, the defendant repeatedly told the jury that one of the witnesses \"felt threatened for her family\" and that she did not want to leave the house after she had been slapped.  The complaint further alleges that the prosecutor used personal pronouns and incorrect grammar to indicate that she was referring to the witness as the victim.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the prosecutor did not mention the victim in her closing argument, and instead referred to her as the aggressor.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed criminal charges against the defendant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and order them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 and $20,000, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Dec. 20, 2016).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney\u2018s Office for Wyoming, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Wyoming Department of Criminal Justice."
