  "summary": "On January 7, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against the Attorney General of California in favor of a quo warranto action against the City of Glendale.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, California, on April 2, 2013, Frank Quintero was appointed to fill a vacant City Council seat vacated by Rafi Manoukian.  The complaint alleges that the Attorney general improperly exercised her discretion in denying the request for leave to sue in violation of Section 12 of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action in the case against Quinteros, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the AttorneyGeneral consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating Section 12 and orders her to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.  On January 13, the court granted the court's request for a temporary restraining order and entered a judgment ordering the issuance of an order halting the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.  An SEC order imposing the order also prohibits the issuance or purchase of any security deposit in the name of a public office or city employment, and requires the attorney general to provide a copy of the complaint to the court.  A hearing is scheduled for May 24, 2014.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, No 17, and No. 17, 2013 (Securities Act).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint seeks a permanent injunction, an injunction, and an officer-and-director bar from serving as an officer or director of a municipal agency. \u00c2\u00a0In its investigation, the SEC obtained an order appointing a receiver to oversee the issuance and issuance of the emergency court orders.
