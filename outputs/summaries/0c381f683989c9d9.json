  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the termination of parental rights to seven Amish children.  The court found that the children were removed, in relevant part, because of Father's alleged long-term sexual abuse of R.W., and that he failed to complete sex-offender treatment.  According to the court's order, the defendants failed to adequately address the allegations in the complaint, which was filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, and unsealed yesterday, that Father had violated the Fifth Amendment by failing to complete a sex offender treatment program.  In addition, the court ruled that the defendants violated Father's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, which prohibits him from participating in any form of adult-based child-advocacy services.  As a result, Father was terminated without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court order, and the court ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.    In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Family and Children today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, charging them with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-1 thereunder. \u00c2\u00a0The court also ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties of $15,000 each, and ordered the children to be placed with their maternal uncle and his family, who are also part of the Amish community.  On the same day, the District Attorney's Office announced criminal charges against Father for his role in the alleged child-abuse, and a civil proceeding against Father was instituted against him.

The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigatory Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage parents to check the background of anyone offering or offering them advice on how to spot signs of child abuse.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, the FBI, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, the Alabama Department of Child Affairs, the Florida Department of Banking and Securities, the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance, the Virginia Department of Justice, the Ohio Department of Education, the"
