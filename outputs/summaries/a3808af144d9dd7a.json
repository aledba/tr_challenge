  "summary": "On July 11, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against Monster Energy Company, Inc. and its former CEO, Gerald Lange, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that Monster violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Monster has agreed to settle the SEC's action by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $250,000.  In its order, the court also ordered Monster to pay disgorgement of $150,000, prejudgment interest of $20,000 and a $50,000 civil penalty.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Monster and Lange agreed to a settlement that would permanently enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and require them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $500,000 or $1 million, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On August 2, 2017, a federal district court in California entered an order ordering Monster to comply with the court order, ordering the company to provide an accounting of all of the alleged violations in its arbitration agreement, and ordering it to provide a full accounting of the total amount of alleged violations.    Monster also agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations, from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, from future violations of the securities laws. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael F. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
