  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Washington today announced criminal charges against Millennium Bulk Terminals-Longview, LLC (\"Millennium\"), a company owned by NWA, for its role in a fraudulent sublease of state-owned aquatic lands.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, alleges that DNR violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, DNR's denial of consent to sublease was unreasonable because it did not consider the financial condition and business reputation of the company or its subtenant.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Millennium failed to disclose in its application for a long-term lease with DNR that it planned to construct a large coal export terminal at the Longview site and failed to provide adequate environmental controls.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Millennium agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins DNR from future violations of Section 9.1 of the lease and orders it to submit a new application for sublease. The settlement is subject to court approval.  DNR also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay an officer and director bar of the agency.  A hearing for the proposed sublease is scheduled for May 17, 2018.   The complaint also names Millennium as a potential sub tenant for the purpose of recovering the company's assets from the bankruptcy of Arch Coal, which was in default of its lease obligations under the lease. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Natural Resources, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
