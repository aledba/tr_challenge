  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against First Advantage Background Services Corp., a Florida-based company that prepares and prepares criminal background reports on individuals.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that, in 2012, First Advantage filed a civil injunctive action against Ricky Williams, a convicted felon who had been previously incarcerated for selling cocaine. The complaint further alleges that in preparing the background report for Rent-A-Center, the company falsely claimed that Ricky Williams had been convicted of a felony and that he had been rehabilitated. In fact, according to the complaint, Ricky Williams was not rehabilitated and did not have a criminal record at the time of the background check. In addition, the complaint alleges that the company did not follow its common-name procedure, which requires a minimum of three identifiers to qualify a defendant for a punitive damages award. The SEC also alleges that First Advantage failed to follow its own procedure when preparing a background report on Ricky Williams.  First Advantage agreed to settle the SEC's charges by agreeing to pay $250,000 in disgorgement, $1 million in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $2 million. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Williams. In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC filed a complaint against Williams, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also ordered First Advantage to pay a $3.3 million civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, First Advance agreed to pay the $3 million penalty. The amount of the civil penalty will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  Second Advantage has agreed to a settlement where it will pay a penalty equal to the amount of its compensatory and punitive damages awards.  Third Advantage agreed not to pay any civil penalty at all.  It also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to pay an officer and director bar.  Finally, it agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins First Advantage from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal and state securities laws, and orders it to provide for a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the securities laws. The settlements are subject to Court approval, and the court will determine whether to impose a penalty at a later date."
