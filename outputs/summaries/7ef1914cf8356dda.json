  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas yesterday entered a final judgment against First Choice Tax Services, a tax preparer based in Grand Prairie, Texas, ordering her to pay over $2 million in restitution.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fort Worth, alleges that, from 2010 to 2012, Julia Tolentino prepared false tax returns for the IRS by claiming false education credits and false business expenses and losses.  According to the complaint, the IRS then interviewed seven First Choice clients who identified her as their tax return preparer. Each of those returns included a false tax education credit, for a total tax loss of $37,217. The complaint further alleges that Tolentine, along with her codefendants, engaged in the jointly undertaken criminal activity of filing false and fraudulent tax returns with others at First Choice and that the amount of restitution she agreed to pay exceeded the amount she committed to pay in the plea agreement.  In its final judgment, the court found that, based on the facts contained in the complaint and the evidence presented in the case, that the restitution amount should be equal to the amount in her plea agreement and that she was liable as a defendant for the total restitution amount.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Tolentina consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment also imposes a penalty of six months\u2019 imprisonment and a $1,685,520 penalty.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Mascianica of the federal district court for the southern district of Texas granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Fort Worth Police Department, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Texas Office of Financial Regulation in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 541 F.3d 456, 419 (5th Cir. 2008).
