  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Gebre Whitelock, Jr., a Georgia man charged with child molestation and cruelty to children in the first degree.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta on August 30, 2010, the defendant told his stepdaughter that, if she did not do it or if she told anyone, the government would not put the defendant on trial. The complaint alleges that, in the months leading up to the alleged molestation, the Appellant repeatedly told the victim that he was going to have to have sex with her \"for no reason\" and that he would \"always punish[her] for no reason.\" The complaint further alleges that the defendant frequently showed the victim \"nasty videos\" on the computer in his and his wife\u2019s bedroom, which he allegedly showed to the victim and her mother.  In addition, the complaint alleged that, while the victim was being molested by the defendant, he frequently \"punished\" the victim by making her stay alone in her bedroom for the entire day.  The complaint also alleges that one day, the victim confronted the defendant about the alleged misconduct, and the defendant confronted her about it, telling her that she had to watch the videos because she was afraid of the grandmother.  As alleged in the complaint, the judge instructed the defendant not to object to the prosecutor's statement during closing arguments, and instead to let the victim rest in her own home for the night.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the Defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Atlanta Police Department, the Georgia State Attorney General's Office, the FBI Criminal Investigation Division, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and other emergency relief."
