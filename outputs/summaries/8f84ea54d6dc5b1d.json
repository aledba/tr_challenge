  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Washington today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of three felonies in California in 2002, 2004, and 2005.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle on June 5, 2016, David B. Haggard, a resident of Kenmore, Washington, was charged with three felony counts in California.  The complaint alleges that, in July 2016, a federal district court in Washington, D.C., issued a warrant to search the Kenmore home of his sister and brother. The court found that a prior felony conviction, which had been dismissed after a deferred sentence, did not impact a defendant's offender score.  In a parallel action, on March 1, 2012, the court held that the previous felony conviction was not a sufficient basis for a warrantless search and seizure of the home.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the new felony conviction interrupted the washout period for prior class C felony offenses, which affected the offender\u2019s offender score, and the timing of a prior conviction when calculating an offender score for a prior criminal conviction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, which will be offset by a civil penalty of $5,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of the United States District Judge in Seattle and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Washington State Attorney General's Office, the FBI, the Department of Justice, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations Division, the Postal Inspection Service Criminal Investigation Division and the Federal Office of Inspector General. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
