  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans today entered a final judgment against a New Orleans-based food hall and its owner in a trademark infringement action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that the New Orleans City Department of Public Affairs (DOPA) and New Orleans Department of Commerce (DOC) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that defendants violated the common law right to use the mark in connection with the creation, operation, promotion, and operation of a public food hall.  According to the complaint, the Department of Parks and Recreation agreed to a preliminary injunction that would prohibit the use of the mark outside the city.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 4, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Bayou Secret, St. Roch F & B, Inc. and its founder, Will Donaldson, alleging that they violated the federal securities laws by failing to register the mark as a service mark with the DOPA.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  To learn more about how to spot a mark, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, and No. 17-cv-1.  For more information on how to register a mark in a public place, see Trademark Abuse Task Force (TRUST).
