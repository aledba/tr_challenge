  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a California man accused of committing a delusional disorder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Yosef Shavuii Bendovid, a convicted felon, was falsely told by jail doctors that he had a \"delusional disorder\" and that he was being treated for a \"psychotic disorder.\" The complaint further alleges that the jail doctors had not diagnosed him for his delusional disorder, which is a severe mental disorder. The complaint alleges that, contrary to the jail doctor\u2019s claims, he was receiving medication for \"significant mental health symptoms\" in jail, and that his treatment was directed toward a \"pervasive and sustained emotion\" over his fear of going to prison. According to the complaint, in addition to the medication he received in jail and in prison, the jail medical records also reflect that he received medication for a different mental disorder in jail. The SEC also alleges that in committing the alleged act, Bendovida had the delusional belief that the two medications he received there were related to a specific mental disorder, and the jail authorities and ASH medical authorities diagnosed him with a \"mood disorder\" during the relevant treatment period. In addition, the SEC alleges that Bendovidian had a history of \"violent and aggressive behavior\" and showed a limited insight into his disorder and need for treatment.  Brannick agreed with the SEC's findings, and agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New Jersey today announced that it filed criminal charges and obtained a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and imposing a civil penalty of $25,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering Bendovidia to pay civil penalties of $10,000 each. The court also granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations, and ordered the release of a second defendant, who was later convicted of the same charges. The defendants agreed to pay a total of $1.2 million in restitution and a $1,500 civil penalty. The settlements are pending approval by the court.  Bendov"
