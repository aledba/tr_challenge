  "summary": "On January 2, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Artforum International Magazine, Inc. (\"Artforum\"), a New York City-based art publisher, and its co-publisher, Knight Landesman, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, from August 2012 through December 2013, plaintiff was employed by Artforum as an art curator and art dealer, and was one of its four co-founders at the time.  As alleged in the complaint, from at least 2012 through the end of 2013, when she was employed as an Artforum employee and was asked to leave the company to pursue a career in the art world, she sought the personal help of two of Artforum's co-owners, Alex Kitnick and Charles Guarino, to resolve the issue.  The complaint alleges that, despite her repeated requests to stop the harassment, Artforum did not take any action.  Instead, the complaint alleges, as a result of this conduct, plaintiff sought the assistance of two Artforum co-authors in restraining the harassment of Kitnick, who was then in his late 50s, and another art critic who appeared regularly in the industry.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Landesmann.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Complaint alleges that Artforum violated Section 8 of the Exchange Act and Rules 8-107(a)(7) and 8-11 thereunder, and that the complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of Exchange Act Sections 5(a) and 5(c).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Frank P. Nervo and Ms. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the New York Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission."
