  "summary": "On May 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against defendants Desarrollos Hotelco, C.A. (DHC) and Hotelco Curacao Holding, N.V. (Hotelco), which were found liable as alter egos of Hotelco and DHC in interest in connection with the Ritz Carlton hotel project.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on February 5, 2007, the defendants agreed to settle the litigation by agreeing to pay $2.2 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of money owed to the defendants.  The defendants also agreed to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty for each of the defendants' violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $2,200,000 each.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged scheme.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
