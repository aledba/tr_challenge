  "summary": "On May 15, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana entered a final judgment against Douglas Kirby, finding that the Indiana Department of Education violated the antifraud provisions of Section 35-42-4-14 of the federal securities laws.  The court also found that, while Kirby was a convicted sex offender, he did not \"knowingly or intentionally\" plead guilty because he didn't know at the time of his plea that he would later be barred from school property.  According to the court's order, however, in 2015, when Kirby was sentenced to prison for child solicitation, he was required to register as a \"serious sex offender\" and to attend school functions and sporting events.  In addition, the court found that Kirby could not raise his ex post facto claim in a post-conviction proceeding because he had already been convicted of a qualifying offense and had to stop attending school events after completing probation.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, Kirby consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the anti-trafficking provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 5b-5(b) and (c) thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000 and a civil penalty of $5,000.  Kirby also agreed to be permanently enjoined from associating with any person who is not a registered sex offender and from participating in any form of school activities, including, without limitation, participating in the activities of his son or grandchild.  On May 16, 2019, a federal district court in Indianapolis entered a judgment ordering Kirby to comply with the SEC's order that he not enter school grounds as a result of his prior conviction. The court granted Kirby's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from entering school grounds for a period of five years, and ordered him to return to the district court for a hearing scheduled for June 5, 2019. The Court also ordered Kirby to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  To learn more about pre-judgment injunctions, see Litigation Release No. 521.
