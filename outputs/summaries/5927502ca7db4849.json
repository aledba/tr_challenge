  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a jury that deliberated on the death of his brother, Sokorng \u201cSok\u201d Hem.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that on May 18, 2017, a jury deliberated for nearly an hour without a hearing.  According to the complaint, the jury was told that one of the defendants had engaged in self-defense when he shot at his brother multiple times, threatened a witness, disposed of the gun, and had threatened his brother with a firearm.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant had threatened a peace officer who found the gun and threatened to kill the officer.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the jurors were on the verge of convicting the defendant of second degree murder when they overheard the defendant saying, \"I'm worried about letting [appellant] out so he could kill someone else's kid.\"  The complaint further alleges that one juror had expressed worry about \u201cletting [defendant] out\u201d and that one or more of the jurors had been willing to settle on manslaughter.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the court granted the SEC an emergency asset freeze and ordered a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violating the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the Securities Act of 1933, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $10,000 each.  On May 24, 2017 the court issued an order requiring a hearing to determine whether a jury member has engaged in misconduct, and whether any of the jury members agreed to participate in a hearing that would determine whether they had suffered prejudice.   The court also ordered the jury not to discuss the case with anyone, including fellow jurors, until all of them were together in the jury deliberation room.  Finally, on May 23, 2017 a federal district court in Brooklyn, New York entered an order imposing a preliminary injunction against future violations, ordering a jury trial, and ordering the jury to be sequestered in a separate room for the duration of the trial. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jennifer C. Barry and Eric Werner and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office."
