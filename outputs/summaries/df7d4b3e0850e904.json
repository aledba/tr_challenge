  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Vincent Marzullo in a civil action brought by the Philadelphia Regional Office against him for failing to timely respond to a summons and complaint filed by his predecessor in interest on November 30, 2007 to secure a note given the same date by defendant in interest.  According to the court's order, filed on November 28, 2016, Marzulo, a resident of the Commonwealth, not an attorney, and not the sheriff of the county where service was performed, filed an affidavit of service stating that he was not served by the process server.  The court also found that the referee failed to hold a hearing on the merits of the complaint and that the amount due and owing plaintiff could not be disregarded by a court exercising its discretion.  In addition, the court found that, in the two years between filing of the motions and oral arguments, defendant had not provided proof of filing of a successive notice of pendency, as the original judgment had not been issued.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, with a civil penalty of $10,000, and a $25,000 civil penalty.  On November 29, 2016 the court granted the SEC's motion for renewal of the default judgment against Michael Chiusano, who was previously barred by the court from serving as a judge based on his status as a \"competent adult.\"  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Karpel and Mr. Kerndetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.N. Secret Service, the Department of Justice, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
