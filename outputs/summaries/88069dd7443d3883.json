  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Connecticut-based trucking company for its role in a third-party action that injured an employee.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the Connecticut Department of Workforce Development (DWRD) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that DWRD violated the right to a one-third reduction in workers' compensation benefits for an injured employee when, in fact, the employer paid only a fraction of the amount of the injured employee's compensation benefits to the employee. The SEC also alleges that, in some instances, the company did not reimburse the injured individual for his or her injuries. In a parallel action, the Department of Health and Human Services today announced that it had obtained a court order requiring it to impose a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze. The Department of Labor's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Eric D.
