  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against Sara J. Kubik, a tenure-track professor who was not appointed to a new term, on her claims that she was discriminated against because she was a member of a protected class.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Kubik was hired by Central Michigan University to serve as an assistant professor in 2011 and was reappointed during fall 2012 through a standard process that includes a departmental recommendation, a recommendation from the dean of the department\u2019s college, and an ultimate decision by the provost. The complaint alleges that Kubik engaged in activity protected by Title VII and the ELCRA, and that, thereafter, she exercised her exercise of [such protected activity] by taking an employment action adverse to the plaintiff.  Kubik has not presented sufficient evidence to make out a prima facie case for the adverse action.  The SEC alleges that, based on her conduct, she was subjected to unwelcomed harassment, a shortcoming in her qualifications for her second child, and a hostile work environment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Civil Rights and Institutional Equity today announced criminal charges against Kubik arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint. The SEC's Office of Compliance has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Michigan Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
