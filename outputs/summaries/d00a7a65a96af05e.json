  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Lameik Degroate, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 18 months in prison for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that, on July 20, 2018, the District Court issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order suspending Degroat from appearing or practicing before the court as a supervisee.  According to the complaint, the order temporarily halted the suspension pending the outcome of a subsequent revocation hearing.  On August 28, 2017, the court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and a temporary home-and-barrel injunction, and issued a final order permanently enjoining the suspension from further violations of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced that it filed a related administrative action against Degroata.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, however, the SEC consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the suspension, and orders the suspension to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  For further information, see Litigation Release Bulletin No. 3552 (July 27, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the New York Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the U.N. Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Justice in this matter."
