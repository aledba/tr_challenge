  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a Texas-based attorney who was convicted of defrauding his wife in a wrongful death case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, Robyn R. Lewis was married to James A. Simmons and they divorced in 2007.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the divorce, Lewis was unable to obtain a copy of the 1996 Will from her ex-husband, who was the sole beneficiary of the estate.  As alleged in the complaint, Lewis' will was revoked by default on the basis of her failure to return it to decedent at any time before her death.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Lewis consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Texas today announced criminal charges against Lewis.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily identify people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In addition, the SEC encourages investors to \"check the background\" of anyone offering them investment advice by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's investor.gov website to identify whether their investments are registered with the SEC or a broker-dealer. Investors can also check whether their funds are being used to purchase or rent a home.  For example, in one instance, a friend of Lewis's who had been living in Texas at the time of her divorce told the SEC that she had received a letter from an attorney stating that she would receive a \"last Will and Testament\" from her husband shortly after her divorce.  However, the neighbor's testimony, which was corroborated by the neighbor, indicated that the letter was signed by the attorney, and that the notary attested to the signing"
