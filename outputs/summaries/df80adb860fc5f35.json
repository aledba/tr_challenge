  "summary": "On March 13, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania entered final judgments against Pennsylvania and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in a related administrative proceeding.  The Court found that Pennsylvania violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 13b-5 thereunder. The Court also found that, contrary to the Commission\u2019s findings, Pennsylvania failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claim that the 1994 SMDL is an interpretive rule that requires states to pay for services that are not related to the administration of the federal health care program. The court also ruled that Pennsylvania was entitled to discovery based on its prior decision to disallow reimbursement of services related to provider training under the federal Medicaid program.  In its final judgment, the Court held that the 2014 SMDL was an \"interpretive rule\" and that it did not require states to reimburse the provider for training costs. In addition, the court held that Pennsylvania did not have the authority to determine whether it should pay for the training costs as administrative costs under the state plan, and that the Commission had the right to do so. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Pennsylvania. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, charges Pennsylvania with violating the federal securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction, an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, and an officer and director bar. The Commission has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Pennsylvania from violating these provisions, and orders the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit a plan that complies with the federal rules. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case is being handled by John Rymas of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica and Ms. Cottrill of the Market Abuse Unit, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Office of the Inspector General in this matter."
