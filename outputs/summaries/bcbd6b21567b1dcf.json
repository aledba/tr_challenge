  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of the double-murder of a child.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Jasean Rusher, 20 months old, was brutally beaten to death by his mother, Tommie Rusher.  According to the complaint, Mudge told the jury that she was ashamed to be an attorney because she believed that the defendant was a \"repeat offender.\"  The complaint further alleges that Mudge also told the jurors that she \"played the jury's emotions like a fiddle\" when she questioned the credibility of the defendant and his theory of the case.  In addition, the complaint alleges that she repeatedly told the defendant that he was the only medical expert who ever saw a child's body and that he had never previously been hit by a gun or a knife.  Mudge's testimony, however, was inconsistent with the evidence presented to the court.  For example, she told the court that she did not object to the defendant's use of a flip-flop, saying that he should have been persuaded to testify that the child had no injuries, and that she should have called Dr. Young to corroborate her account of the events.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  Finally, the court agreed to a judgment ordering Mudge to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and ordered her to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On the same day, the SEC instituted an administrative proceeding against Mudge, ordering her to return to the United States and pay a civil monetary penalty of $100,000.  As part of the administrative proceeding, the Court granted Mudge a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, and ordered that she comply with the court's order.  A hearing is scheduled for May 5, 2018, for which the SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
