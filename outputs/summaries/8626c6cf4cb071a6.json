  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Texas father and his half-sister in connection with their unlawful termination of parental rights.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that A.W.H. (Mother) and H.L. (Father) violated Section 161.001(b)(1)(E) and (1)(B) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from at least September 2017 through August 2018, Mother and Father had supervised visitation with Julie while she was in a one-bedroom home and the Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) conducted a drug test that determined that Father had a history of drug use and had been convicted of manufacturing and delivering cocaine.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in the pendency of the litigation, Father and Mother continued to test positive for opiates and drug metabolites even after the Department learned that Mother had given birth to another child, and the drug test results were negative for the drug.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Mother consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $10,000.  Mother also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 17, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action against Father, alleging that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and that the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against Father from violating these provisions.   In a parallel action, the Texas Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting Father's and Mother's unlawful termination from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or promotion of any child under the age of three. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage parents to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investigational\u00c2\u00a0finder.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to identify whether they are registered professionals."
