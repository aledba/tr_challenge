  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against Larry E. Clark and his wife, L & M Hair Care Products, Inc. (L&M), in an emergency action to halt the expropriation of three lots of land in Shreveport, Louisiana, needed for construction of I-49.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Baton Rouge, Clark and L&M began expropriating the land in 1986. The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to properly raise a now precluded issue in the first lawsuit, the amount of compensation for the loss of the building on the property, and that Clark was entitled to compensation for that loss.  The complaint further alleges that Clark failed to comply with the court's order to nullify the previous judgments, which had been reversed by the court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Clark.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants.  Clark has also filed a brief seeking a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Clark has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $191,781.00, a $13,025.20 officer-and-director bar, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
