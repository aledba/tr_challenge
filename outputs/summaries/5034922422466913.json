  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against the Illinois Department of Environmental Quality in favor of the agency.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Will County, Illinois, alleges that the state and the agency violated the antifraud provisions of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act (EPA) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, in 2010, the Illinois Secretary of State's Office issued an order requiring the EPA to adopt rules to protect groundwater from CCDD and US fill operations.  In its order, the agency also recommended that the Board adopt rules that would permit the use of \"back-end\" groundwater monitoring, which is intended to detect and prevent groundwater contamination.  As alleged, the Board's order did not consider the risks posed by older and noncompliant fill.  Instead, the complaint alleges that it relied on the agency's findings, which were inconsistent with those of the Board, and failed to consider the costs of compliance with those requirements.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the board agreed to the final judgment that it was arbitrary and capricious for failing to consider those facts when it issued its order.  For example, the court found that the agency failed to adequately consider the impact of groundwater monitoring on fill operations, and that it failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its earlier decision to reject subpart G of EPA. The court also ordered the agency to consider whether it was reasonable to impose a \"cost-based\" rule on fill operation operators.  On August 2, 2016, the Court granted the request for a temporary restraining order against the agency from further violations of the federal, state, and local laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule10b2-1 thereunder, and ordered the entity to conduct an independent review of its compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois Office of Inspector General in this matter."
