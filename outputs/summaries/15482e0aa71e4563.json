  "summary": "On February 6, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of a Louisiana-based manufacturer of shaved-ice machines.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on August 10, 2016, Eddie Stewart, III, a commercial truck driver, was assigned a job transporting a product from Michigan to the Gulf Coast using a tanker-trailer manufactured by Polar Corporation and Polar Tank Trailer, LLC (collectively, \u201cthe Polar defendants\u201d). According to the complaint, Stewart was assigned the job by his superior, who allegedly loaded the trailer with the incorrect chemical. The complaint alleges that Stewart left the refinery after the loading was complete and continued on his route. Shortly thereafter, the trailer exploded on the side of the interstate in Ohio, allegedly causing Stewart to suffer personal injuries. The SEC alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) thereunder of the federal securities laws. In addition, the court found that the Polar defendants had sufficient minimum contacts with Louisiana to exercise jurisdiction over them.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Stewart.  On February 13, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Marathon Petroleum Company LP, Polar Corporation, and its subsidiary, Polar Tank trailer, LLC, alleging that they violated the federal registration provision of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Marathon and Polar have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of the defendants. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-20 (January 17, 2019).  The U. S. Attorney's office for the Eastern District of Louisiana today announced parallel criminal charges.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Criminal Investigations, with the assistance of the Division of Securities and Exchange Commission's Office of Compliance. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling or offering them investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling investments."
