  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (\"Merck\"), a now-defunct Pennsylvania-based pharmaceutical company, and two other private medical practices, Sugartown Pediatrics, LLC and Schwartz Pediatrics S.C. (\"Schwartz\"), alleging that as to its RotaTeq Rotavirus vaccine, instead of lowering the price which it was charging when it held 100% of the market, Merck responded to the entry of GlaxoSmithKline's competing vaccine, Rotarix, by adding an \"exclusionary\" Bundled Loyalty Condition to its [buying] contracts, thereby bundling Rota Teq with its other pediatric vaccines.  Merck has effectively co-opted the PBGs to impose and enforce its anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct with the result that they and the proposed class members have repeatedly paid artificially inflated prices for their rotavirus vaccines since the beginning of the year.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Rule 206(3) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants have consented to entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requiring Merck to pay civil penalties.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by David A. Kasper and Amy S. Cotter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance, the Department of Justice, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, the Philadelphia Office of Financial Regulation, the Division of Insurance's Market Abuse Unit, the Office of Market Intelligence, the U.K. Secretary of State's Office, the FBI's Cyber Unit and the Pennsylvania Secretary of Health and Human Services."
