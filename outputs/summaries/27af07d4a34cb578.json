  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the City of Bastrop for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on April 29, 2013, Brenda Lewis, a resident of Carter Park in Bastrop, Louisiana, tripped on an above ground support brace of a fence at one of the playing fields. According to the complaint, Lewis was unable to participate in the activities she enjoyed before the accident because she had no duty of care to keep the fence in place. The complaint further alleges that the city employees inspected Carter Park on the date of the accident and left caution tape in place to prevent her from tripping or falling. The court also found that, contrary to what the complaint alleges, the city did not warn the public of the possible dangers posed by the rebar stake. The SEC alleges that Lewis' fall was the result of a deliberate failure to warn her.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Lewis.  On May 2, 2019, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of Louisiana entered a judgment against Lewis, ordering her to pay $1,078.71 in disgorgement, $1.22 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $58,180.53. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing on June 29, 2015, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. for a hearing on the SEC's motion for summary judgment, which was subject to approval by the court. The hearing will be led by Mr. Lewis, Ms. Allen, and Ms. Lewis. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Public Safety Division.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-2795 (B)(2)(A) and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, 13b2-2, and 13b-11 thereunder.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit, with assistance from Eric Werner of the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New Orleans Regional Office. The litigation is being led by Jennifer C. McKinley and Mr. Werner under the supervision of Eric R. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
