  "summary": "On October 25, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found not disabled and therefore unentitled to Supplemental Security Income (SSI).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City on October 30, 2014, a defendant with a history of severe mental health impairments filed for SSI alleging that he suffered from a number of alleged impairments including, inter alia, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder.  The complaint alleges that, based upon his alleged symptoms, Plaintiff was not entitled to SSI because he did not have sufficient functional capacity to perform work-related activities, such as babysitting his children.  As alleged in the complaint, Plaintiff's severe impairments, alone or in combination, made him unable to perform his or her past relevant work.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.   The SEC's Complaint alleges that the SEC improperly obtained a court order finding Plaintiff not disabled in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit for a period of five years, and requires him to provide a copy of the complaint to the court for further determination by the court upon motion of the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5180304 (July 13, 2016).  The Complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the anti-deterrent provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(e) the securities laws.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation of this matter was conducted by Michael J. Pollock and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0"
