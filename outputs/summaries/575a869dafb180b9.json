  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against two juvenile defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 14(B) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that C.S., Jr. and Z.T. participated in a series of video-recorded disposition-modification hearings in late 2017 and 2018, in which the trial court granted the State's request and made each juvenile a ward of the DOC.  According to the complaint, the defendants' remote participation made a fair hearing impossible and presented a substantial potential for harm.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants did not object to their remote participation in the hearings because they were physically present at the hearing.  As the complaint further alleges, neither of the defendants objected to appearing at the hearings by video.  C&S, Jr., and ZT. each agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of Sections 14(a) and 14(b)(2)(B) and Rule 14(c) thereunder, and the defendants agreed to transfer to the Department of Correction.   The Defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 15(a)(1) and (3) and 17(a), and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. \u00c2\u00a0The Defendants also have agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the penalty imposed by the court on each of them.  Additionally, Defendants have agreed not to participate in any disciplinary proceedings that are not directly or indirectly related to the defendant's remote participation.  Defendants have also agreed that the court will determine whether to grant them a fair trial by video rather than by issuing a written judgment imposing a permanent injunction against them from participating in the disciplinary proceedings.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 14(A)(2).  The Complaint also alleges that defendants have failed to show sufficient cooperation and cooperation to overcome the issues raised in the complaint.  Finally, the Complaint alleges that, in a parallel action, the Court of Appeals granted the Defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the Defendants to appear by video instead of in person.  To settle the matter, Defendants consented to entry"
