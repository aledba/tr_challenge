The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Newark, New Jersey, alleges that Lexington violated the pre-judgment provision of the federal securities laws by failing to show that it had a reasonable probability of success in a pretrial detention proceeding.  According to the complaint, the defendants were held in custody because they could not afford to pay the $2,500 or $3,500 bail required by the court.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants who were not named as a defendant in the complaint could be released even if they had access to untainted funds to post as bail.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Lexington agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.

The final judgments also order Delaney to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  Wilfredo Aguilar, Jr., a lawyer for Delaney, has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently barred from appearing or practicing before the court as a result of the Court's finding that he has violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The settlement is subject to approval by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in a parallel action.
