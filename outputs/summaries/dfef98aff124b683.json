  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a Kansas City, Missouri man who was convicted of four counts of statutory sodomy and two counts of child molestation in the first degree following a jury trial in the Circuit Court of Jackson County.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Missouri, alleges that the trial court erred by overruling his objections to certain verdict directors and ordering Cruz-Basurto to be sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment based on a mistaken belief that the jury had found him guilty of all four of the charges.  According to the complaint, the jury deliberated for nearly two hours before finding him guilty on all four counts.  In its final judgment, the court found that the defendant violated his right to due process rights by imposing consecutive sentences on the statutory sodom counts, and that he had failed to show sufficient evidence to show that he committed the acts that constituted deviate sexual intercourse.  On the other hand, the judgment found that, contrary to what the jury found, Cruz-basurto had violated his due-process rights by not acting for the purpose of gratifying or gratifying his own or someone else\u2019s sexual desires.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's opinion, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his prior prison time.  To settle the SEC case, the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, to be barred from serving as officers or directors of a public company, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest in the amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Attorney General's Office and the Missouri Department of Justice in this matter."
