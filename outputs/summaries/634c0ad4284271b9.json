  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against Susan L. Kestel, a former desk clerk at a title company, for her alleged inability to work due to her severe mental impairments.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dayton, Ohio on March 6, 2015, Kestele, then forty-nine years old, alleged that she was unable to work because she suffered from severe impairments related to depression, diabetes mellitus, spine disorder, dysfunction of major joints, left carpal tunnel syndrome, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The complaint further alleges that the complaint was filed in the District of Columbia with the SEC as an emergency relief.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that, based on the SEC\u2019s findings, KESTel was not able to perform basic mental work activities, and that she had developed a severe anxiety disorder and a history of post-traumatic stress disorder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, however, the complaint alleges that in a parallel action, the federal district court for the southern district of Ohio entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the SEC from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the SEC to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion of the SEC.  On March 8, 2017, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the issuance of an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation.  A hearing on March 9, 2017 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. EST.  Kestelle consented to the entry of the order.    The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Department of Health and Human Services, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.  Separately, the Department of Justice announced that it had obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing investigation into the alleged misconduct of a state agency mental health specialist. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of anyone selling a business by\u00c2\u00a0using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2"
