  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against two sisters for their roles in a scheme to defraud immigrant victims.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that Alba Pena and Indranis Rocheford, were among the victims of the scheme.  According to the complaint, Pena was one of the victims, and her mother, Patria Zuniga, was another. The complaint alleges that, in exchange for illegal immigration services, Zunig allegedly provided her mother with wire transfers and bank deposits in her shared bank account in return for immigration services. The SEC alleges that the defendants made the transfers and deposits in their accounts in the course of the fraud, and that, as a result of their participation in the scheme, the defendants were barred from participating in the payment of the fraudulent services. In addition, the complaint alleged that Pena's sister, Isabel Morales, made a bank deposit directly into Rocheford's bank account as payment for the fraud.  In a parallel action, the United States Department of Justice today announced that it has obtained a final judgment against Pena for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Pena to pay $17,534 in disgorgement and $14,000 in prejudgment interest. The court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, and entered an order freezing the assets of both defendants.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered a final order ordering Pena guilty of all counts of wire fraud and ordered Rocheford to pay disgorge of $17.5 million and $1.2 million, respectively, in prejudgments and civil money penalties. The order also ordered Rochefraud to pay a civil penalty of $20,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Rocheford consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay civil penalties of $25,000 and $10,000, respectively. The judgment also prohibits her from associating with any person who has been a victim of the alleged fraud with the defendants, and bars her from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Pena has agreed to a bifurcated settlement where she will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
