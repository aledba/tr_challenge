  "summary": "On February 28, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against three blind vendors who claimed that they suffered \"ongoing discrimination\" based on their blindness arising from the District's administration of the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Facilities Program.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky, Hazell Brooks, Derwin Patten, and Roy Patten are current or past participants in the program.  The complaint alleges that they were denied the benefits and services that come from providing assistance to visually impaired vendors, including the right to a percentage of all income generated by vending machines located on federal property, even if those machines are not operated by program participants.  As alleged in the complaint, they were also denied access to professional counseling provided by D.C. Department of Health and Human Services (DOH) inspectors.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Brooks and Patten have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the three defendants.  On February 26, 2020, the SEC filed a civil action against the defendants, charging them with violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 12(b)(6) and (3) thereunder. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Ms. Brooks and Mr. Patten. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Office of Administrative Hearings, the Kentucky Department of Human Services, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
