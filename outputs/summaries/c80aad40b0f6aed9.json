  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico today entered a preliminary injunction against certain jockeys associations, including Camarero Racetrack Corp. and Asociacion de Jinetes de Puerto Rico, Inc. (CJP).  The SEC's complaint, filed on July 19, 2016, alleges that the cancellation of the horse races scheduled for June 30, July 1 and July 2, 2016 was a violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 15b-5 thereunder.

Among other things, the SEC is seeking an injunction, an officer and director bar, and a penny stock bar.  On August 2, 2018, a federal district court in San Juan, Puerto Rico entered an order freezing the assets of certain of the defendants, including the horses represented by the association, and ordering the suspension of certain horses.  Separately, on September 5, 2017, the Honorable Fernando Torres of the San Juan County District Court issued an order suspending the horses from participating in any type of horse racing event, including professional or amateur, and requiring the horses to be registered with the SEC as part of the"
