  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of Triangle Center, LLC, a California-based real estate development company, and its owner, Carl Schafer, in an administrative proceeding that was conducted by the Los Angeles Regional Office.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Schafer and his wife, Elizabeth Leslie, raised the issue of equitable estoppel in a public hearing on December 31, 2013.  The SEC alleges that, in the hearing, the court found that the city violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,038,767, prejudgment interest of $2,065, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Schafer.  On January 18, 2011, the SEC issued a written order ordering the city to comply with the Commission's finding that the parking lot had no required certificate of occupancy and that it should be restriped or replaced with a \"parking lot.\"  The complaint also alleges that the City failed to inform the owners of the need to restrip the lot in order to permit the restriping of the lot.  As alleged, the complaint further alleges that Schafer's wife and brother-in-law owned lots 70 and 71 in the City of Long Beach, and that, despite repeated representations to the city, the city did not comply with those representations and did not consider the potential for further injustice to the property owner.  Finally, as set forth in the Complaint, the Court found that, as a matter of law, the City violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(d) of The Securities Act, and Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-2, and 13d-1 thereunder, that the Commission violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers\") and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder and that the complaint was inapplicable to the District of Columbia (\"District of Columbia\").  The Complaint alleges that:  The Commission violated Section 5"
