  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Gualberto Perez, an Ohio-based mechanical engineer who was found to have suffered a work-related back injury while working as a manual laborer for Hillis-Carnes Engineering Associates, Inc.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Perez.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Perez was found unable to perform work related to his injury and was entitled to temporary total disability benefits for a limited time period.  Claimant's complaint alleges that, based upon his testimony, Dr. Brislin, M.D., performed a course of physical therapy where he observed that Claimant was unable to work while he recovered immediately following the August 10, 2016 surgery.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this was unrelated to the work related injury.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Perez, who was sentenced to prison for five years and ordered to pay $1.2 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a $100,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Perez consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a $1 million civil penalty in the amount of $2 million.  Perez agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(1) and 17(b)(2) of The Securities Act, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply as an officer and director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Department of Health and Human Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone seeking to apply for or renew their investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0for information about people with disabilities."
