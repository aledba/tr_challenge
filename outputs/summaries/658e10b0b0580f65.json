  "summary": "On February 6, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama entered a final judgment against Doyle Lee Hamm, Jr., an Alabama death-row inmate scheduled to be executed on February 22, 2018.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that Hamm suffered from lymphoma (a type of blood cancer) and lymphadenopathy, which, combined with years of intravenous drug use, have rendered his veins inaccessible for the use of a catheter without a complicated procedure carrying the risk of severe pain and suffering to Hamm.  According to the complaint, Hamm also sought an injunction preventing the Alabama Department of Corrections and the Alabama Attorney General's Office from executing him by intravenous injection.  In its order, the court found that Hamm could show neither a significant likelihood of success on the merits nor irreparable injury in light of the independent medical examiner\u2019s findings, and that an advanced level practitioner would be required to access his veins.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order, Hamm consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On February 16, 2018 the court granted Hamm's request for a preliminary injunction, which would prohibit him from participating in the execution of any inmate who would be executed following a protocol that requires two separate IVs.  As part of the settlement, Hamm agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws and to be barred from serving or practicing as an attorney.  Hamm also agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and to a $50,000 bar.  He also agreed not to participate in any execution without a court order.  At the same time, Hamm filed a motion for a full medical examination, which the court denied.  Among other things, Hamm has asked the court to order him to sign an affidavit stating that he has access to two accessible peripheral veins, one in each leg, and the other in each arm. The court agreed to that order without providing any basis for the court's finding, which is subject to court approval, that Hamm will not experience excess pain or suffering in the course of his execution and that he will not be able to show a substantial likelihood of suffering to his fellow inmates by using central line placement as an alternative to peripheral venous access in accordance with their protocol."
