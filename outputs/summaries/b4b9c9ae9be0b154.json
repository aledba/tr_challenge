  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against HKS Architects, Inc., a California-based architecture firm and a Texas-based design firm, for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that HKS violated the antifraud provisions of Section 410 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, HKS agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and to pay a $1.6 million civil penalty.  HKS also agreed to pay $1,617,073.70 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of its profits.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the firm.  As alleged, in its complaint, the SEC alleges that in 2007 and 2008 HKS and HKS entered into a contract in which they agreed to participate in the construction of a luxury hotel in Mammoth Lakes, Texas.   The complaint further alleges that the contract contained a clause that prohibited HKS from participating in any type of litigation, including a civil proceeding or obtaining a judgment or other resolution in this state or the courts of this state. \u00c2\u00a0The complaint also alleged that in 2008 and 2009 HKS signed a contract with a Texas company that included a forum selection clause that required that any disputes arising out of or relating to the project be resolved by the parties at the time.  This contract also included a provision requiring that all claims, disputes, and other matters in question be settled in accordance with the terms of the contract.  For example, in 2008, the court granted HKS's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered HKS to comply with the court's order.  On May 9, 2009, the Court granted the request for an injunction and ordered that the injunction be temporarily enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the federal laws, including Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and Rule 13a-2 thereunder; and that the court will determine whether to hold a hearing on the matter at a later date upon motion by the SEC.  Finally, on May 10, 2010, a federal district court in Texas entered a preliminary injunction against the proposed settlement and ordered the settlement to be approved by the court upon motion of the SEC, without prejudice to the SEC"
