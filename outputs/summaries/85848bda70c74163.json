  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two defendants who were charged with engaging in a fraudulent scheme to enter the United States from India for six months.  The court entered the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, which was filed on October 27, 2015.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 13b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Gaurav Mehta and his son, Brandon Johnson, who were also charged with the same conduct.  According to the court's order, the defendants were not required to put their inquiries in writing, and the judge did not tell the jury that they could remain impartial. Instead, the judge instructed the jurors that, when confronted by police officers, they should have an opportunity to question the defendants about their motives for entering into their respective marriages. The judge also instructed the jury not to ask the jurors if they could \"stay the hell away from the jury.\"  The final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 each. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Leonard B. Sand and supervised by Marc Blau of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Amy C. McKinley. The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter.    The SEC encourages the public to check the backgrounds of people who commit a crime by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investigative.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are related to a criminal defendant.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of the anti-fraud provision of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20 thereunder.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1325(c).\u00c2\u00a0On October 26, 2015, the Court granted a motion by the SEC for a preliminary injunction against further violations of these provisions, ordered a jury trial, and issued an order appointing an officer and director to assist with the investigation."
