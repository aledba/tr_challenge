  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Royal Catering Company and its owner, Esmeragdo Gomez, in a civil injunctive action brought by American States Insurance Company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to disclose that the truck had permanently attached equipment that permitted it to transport persons or cargo, including a deep fryer, grill, steam table, oven, refrigerator, and coffeemaker.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Royal had not provided the truck with the proper fryer baskets, which blocked the latching mechanism of the truck.  As alleged, the Gomezes' food truck had only two seats and only two seatbelts, and the truck was not equipped to transport personnel other than a driver and a cook.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Royal consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement of $2,428,577.34, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Royal consents to the imposition of a permanent injunction, which is subject to court approval.  American States agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the Exchange Act, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  British Columbia Securities Commission v. Royal, et al., (Dec. 31, 2017) No. 13-cv-01221, No. 1582, (Feb. 2, 2018), No. 17-cv221, (March 22, 2018).  The court granted Royal's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants, as well as an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation of the matter.  On March 2, 2019, the court entered a judgment ordering Royal to disgorge $2.038 million in ill-gotten gains plus interest, and to pay a $50,000 penalty to the receiver.  Following the court's order, Royal agreed to a settlement that would permanently enjoin it from further violations of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) and 13(b)(5) and (c) and order that it pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $20,000,"
