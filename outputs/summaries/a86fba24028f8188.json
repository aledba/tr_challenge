  "summary": "On July 23, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota entered a final judgment against Jose Alarcon, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 18 months in prison for failing to register as a predatory offender.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnesota, alleges that, from at least December 2014 through April 2015, Algarcon moved to a motel room in Albert Lea, Minn. He registered the room as his primary address and paid his rent using a relative\u2019s credit card for nearly 4 months without incident. On April 3, 2015, he left the motel room without having a primary address. The complaint alleges that the motel manager placed a \u201cboot\u201d on the doorknob that prevented him from leaving the room, and a note on the door about the declined credit charge. The SEC further alleges that when the motel attempted to charge him for his living arrangement at the motel, the credit charge was declined.  According to the complaint, the manager then placed a boot on the Doorknob, which prevented Alinarcon from entering the room and prevented him to leave the room.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000. The court also ordered him to comply with the registration requirements of Section 5 of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the Minnesota Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed an emergency action to halt the alleged violations of the registration provisions of Sections 243.166, subd. 3a(a)(2) and (c) the reporting requirements of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and (3) the books and records and officer-and-director bar.  An SEC order appointing a receiver to oversee the registration will be instituted upon motion of the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018.  On August 24, 2017, the Court of Appeals issued an order suspending the registration of certain individuals in violation of the predatory-offender registration provisions.  A hearing scheduled for August 26, 2018 is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.
