  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Northwest Community Hospital (NCH) and other defendants in a medical malpractice action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that on May 13, 2015, a decedent suffered a drop in oxygen levels and cardiac arrest during a surgical procedure at NCH.  According to the complaint, NCH provided NCH with a privilege log containing documents that it deemed privileged and protected under the medical studies provisions of the federal securities laws.  NCH allegedly provided the privilege log to NCH, which was used by the Quality and Patient Safety Committee.  In its privilege log, the court found that NCH violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering NCH to pay a $100,000 civil penalty, and imposing an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar against each of them.  On May 24, 2016, the trial court entered an order holding NCH in contempt for failing to produce the documents in question, ordering it to pay $500,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of NCH's civil penalties.   The court also ordered NCH not to violate the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"), and to pay an officer and director bar and stock bar jointly and severally.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-8-2101 (January 20, 2017).  The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office under the supervision of Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
