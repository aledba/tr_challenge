  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in contempt of court for failing to pay court-ordered fines and costs.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that on April 6, 2017, a trial court held that defendant William P. Appellant was entitled to court-appointed counsel for a civil contempt proceeding because he failed to pay the court-imposed fines.  According to the complaint, the court's order imposed a temporary restraining order, which prohibited the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the right to counsel provisions of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100 per week, $400 in fines, and $1,686.35 in costs. The court also imposed a penalty of 100 days' to eighteen months' imprisonment and immediately paroled him.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On May 9, 2017 a federal court issued a contempt order against Appellants, ordering him to be held in contempt for failure to pay his fines and expenses, and imposing a $750,000 civil penalty.   The court subsequently issued a second contempt order, ordering the defendant to pay $50 per week in restitution, $100 for each contempt proceeding, for a total of $2,860. The SEC also issued a subpoena to compel Appettants to comply with the court order, and to provide counsel to a person opposing the defendant at a contempt proceeding.  Finally, on May 22, 2017 the trial court issued an order holding Appettant in contempt, imposing a five-day officer-and-director bar, and requiring Appettors to provide for a hearing to determine whether the defendant has the financial resources to pay those fines and expense.  Appettents were also ordered to pay disgorgement of $750.00, the amount past due on her court ordered payments, in a single remittance.  As set forth in the order, the judge appointed a probation officer, and the probation officer appointed a receiver to represent the receiver at a hearing.  After the hearing, the receiver was questioned about his financial resources and the receiver's ability to make the payments.  At a hearing on May 24, the jury deliberated for two hours before issuing the order and finding Appetterer in contempt. "
