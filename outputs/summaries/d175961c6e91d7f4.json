  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against a former York Regional Police officer for his role in the distribution and sale of child pornography.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that Brad Rivenbark violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he aided and abetted the transportation of child porn in violation of Section 2252A(a)(5)(B) and Section 9(b)(2)(A) and (c) the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and (3) of 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint also alleges that Rivenbaark violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by using a computer program to access chatrooms that were closed due to the exchange of such materials.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Rivenbraark consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a $75,000 civil penalty against him.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Western District of New York today entered final judgments against Rivenbrick, ordering him to disgorge $5,000, and imposing a civil penalty of $50,000.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Robert A. Currid granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, a temporary injunction, and an officer-and-director bar from accessing the internet for the purpose of recovering child pornography from the agency's possession.  A hearing is scheduled for June 5, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2016.  Separately, the Department of Justice today announced that it has obtained a court order halting the asset freeze and other emergency relief that it obtained from the federal district court.  According to the SEC, the court's order freezes the assets of the defendant, including his personal computer, and prohibits him from associating with any third party, including law enforcement, in connection with the purchase, sale, or promotion of any child pornography, and from using the internet to disseminate or sell any such material. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0ad\u00c2\u00a0investor"
