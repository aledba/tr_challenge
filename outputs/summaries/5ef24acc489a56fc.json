  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against a Mississippi pediatrician and child-abuse treatment provider who was found guilty of second-degree murder in 2008.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that on January 5, 2008, a jury found Joshua Clark (Josh) liable for second- and third-degree murders.  According to the complaint, Dr. Lakin, who was licensed to practice pediatrics and child abuse treatment in Mississippi, provided expert testimony in support of her opinion that a child with shaken-baby syndrome (SBS) should be able to accurately diagnose the cause and timing of a child's injuries. The complaint further alleges that, based upon her testimony, the jury found Josh guilty on the basis of her expert opinion. The court also found that the jury was entitled to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Lakin consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating Rule 10a-5, ordering her to be barred from appearing before the SEC as an expert, and imposing a five-year officer-and-director bar against her.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Lakin. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against her, charging her with violations of Rule 702 of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  A hearing for the SEC today was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern, with the subject of the SEC proceeding to be decided by a jury at a later date. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Barry, and the case will be supervised by Amy C. Welshhans."
