  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Illinois Central Railroad Company Chairman Robert Peirce Jr., who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, in 2005, Seward signed a settled asbestosis claim with Illinois Central.  According to the complaint, the release did not specifically mention exposure to manganese poisoning.  Instead, the complaint alleges that Seward was on notice of the risk of developing brain cancer when he signed the release.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Seward for his role in Seward's alleged exposure to the above-listed toxins.  Seward subsequently developed and passed away from anaplastic oligodendroglioma, a type of brain cancer.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release No. 690, 795\u201396 (Miss. 2008).  The complaint also names as a relief party Illinois Central's motion for summary judgment, which was entered by the trial court on behalf of Seward, as well as the relief party's motion to be denied summary judgment.  To learn more about boilerplate judgments, see Press Release Release Bulletin No. 790, 878.  This case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U. S. Attorney's Department of Justice, the Federal Insurance Regulatory Surveillance Authority, and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
