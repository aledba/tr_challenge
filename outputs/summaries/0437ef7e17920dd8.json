  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Francis Patino Vinas, a Dominican Republic citizen, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Vinas was arrested in the Dominican Republic on November 15, 2015, and that he made a false statement to Customs and Border Protection officers about buying a bottle of Mamajuana in the United States. According to the complaint, Vinas told the officers that he bought the bottle at a local grocery store and that, after he purchased the bottle, he would be sent a phone number for a woman who would pick up the bottle. The complaint alleges that, in reality, the defendant did not buy the bottle and neither did he tell the officers the substance of the statement. The SEC also alleges that the defendant repeatedly lied, in particular his lie about having the bottle in the store. The court also found that, on one of the occasions Vinas made the Store Statement, he did not know that the bottle contained cocaine. In addition, the court found that the defendants' statements to the officers were inconsistent with the facts of the case, and Vinas did not suffer prejudice because he knew that the store statement was false.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained an asset freeze against Vinas in connection with a related criminal case. The Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of making false statements to investors in the securities industry.
