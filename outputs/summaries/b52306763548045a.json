  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania yesterday entered a final judgment against the Social Security Administration for refusing to recognize the same-sex common law marriage of John Roberts and Bernard Wilkerson.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 4, 1990, the SSA refused to recognize Roberts' marriage and instead denied his application for Social Security benefits based on the marriage.  The complaint alleges that Roberts, who was widowed at the time of his death, was not entitled to benefits because a Pennsylvania court had previously recognized his marriage and granted him benefits.  As alleged in the complaint, Roberts' wife, Shirley, had been widowed and had been living in a common-law marriage since 1990.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the complaint charges that Roberts violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order to halt the suspension of the suspension pending final approval by the court.  On November 20, 2017, the court granted Roberts' request for attorney's fees and costs, without requiring the court to consider the merits of the case, and instead granted the request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants' assets, and imposing a civil penalty of $27,720, which is equal to the amount of Roberts' attorney's fee and expenses, and a penny stock bar.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for December 22, 2017.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 2, 2018).  The SEC's Complaint charges Roberts with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder of the federal securities laws and seeks to bar him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply as a party to a court order recognizing the validity of a marriage. The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 5(b).  In its complaint, the SEC previously issued an order requiring it to consider Roberts' claims for benefits in light of an earlier court decision that recognized the marriage and awarded benefits to him.  Last year, the Court issued an Order requiring the SEC to evaluate Roberts' claim for benefits and determine whether it had sufficient evidence to determine whether he had a valid and enforceable marriage."
