  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming today entered a final judgment against a Wyoming man who was convicted of defrauding two high school friends out of millions of dollars.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Wyoming, alleges that Ian Sparks violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Mr. Sparks, who lives in Gillette, Wyoming, made a false allegation of sexual abuse of DJJ, AK, and Mikelah Williams in July 2016. The complaint alleges that DJJ told her father that she had had sex with him and became pregnant by him, and that he had encouraged her to tell her mother about the alleged abuse. The SEC alleges that the complaint was false and misleading, because DJJ's mother reported to the Gillette Police Department that her father had been lying to her about having sex with her.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Sparks.  On March 19, 2015, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the unsealing of the case against Sparks, which is pending final approval by the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71 plus prejudgment interest of $2,096.71, a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2019. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wyoming Department of Criminal Justice, and the Wyoming State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
