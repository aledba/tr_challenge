  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant in a medical malpractice action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that on August 18, 2012, a Chicago-area surgeon who performed a successful gallbladder removal surgery failed to adequately assess the severity of the patient's condition.  According to the complaint, Dr. Diniotis, a board-certified general surgeon at Rush University Medical Center, told his client that he had made a mistake during his surgery and that he should not have performed the procedure because his son had recently been diagnosed with a brain tumor.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in providing postoperative care to Mr. Okic, he failed to provide any evidence that he was negligent in performing the surgery because of his son's condition and because he had no expert to corroborate his claim of postoperative negligence.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 15, 2018, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against the defendant from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered him to return to work on September 22, 2012. The court also granted a request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any medical device, including a CT scan, MRI, or other diagnostic tool, and a hearing on September 24, 2012 to determine whether or not to proceed with a related administrative proceeding. The order also prohibits defendants from providing evidence to the court in support of their claims of preoperative negligence, and from providing any assistance to the jury in determining whether to grant or reject the defendant's motion for summary judgment.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Folena. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Chicago Office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Illinois."
