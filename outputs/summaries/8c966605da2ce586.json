  "summary": "On August 22, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also issued a temporary restraining order halting the defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction, freezing his assets, and ordering him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Atlanta, Georgia, Geovani Johnson, a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison in 1996, attempted to convince the trial court that a race-neutral reason for a preemptory strike was necessary to preserve the right to a fair trial. The complaint alleges that the court did not consider race as a factor in determining whether the strike was discriminatory, and that it did not require a specific reason for the strike to be exercised.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Johnson.  On August 24, 2018 in the District of Columbia, the court entered judgment against Johnson and sentenced him to five years of probation. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Miami Regional Office and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Atlanta Regional Office, and the Atlanta Field Office of the Department of Justice."
