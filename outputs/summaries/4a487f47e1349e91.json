  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Mexican citizen for illegally entering the United States without an examination or inspection.  According to the SEC's complaint, Oracio Corrales-Vazquez, a resident of Tecate, California, illegally entered the country in June 2018 and crossed into the country at a time and place designated for \"examination or inspection\" by immigration officers.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 1325(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1940 (INA), he was arrested and charged with violating the federal criminal laws.  As alleged in the complaint, the federal law requires an alien to enter the country by means of a designated port of entry, and requires that the alien enter at a designated time or place.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Corrale consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of International Affairs today issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a real estate investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify people selling investments in real estate that are not registered with the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC also issued an Investor Alert about potential illegal immigration violations, warning investors to be aware of any signs of an impending immigration enforcement action.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint to the OIEA\u00c2\u00a0Adviser\u00c2\u00a0Commission on Investor Education\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0the Commission\u00c2\u00a0has\u00c2\u00a0issued\u00c2\u00a0a\u00c2\u00a0Notice\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0compliance with\u00c2\u00a0requirements\u00c2\u00a0for\u00c2\u00a0examinations and inspections.\u00c2\u00a0On\u00c2\u00a0May\u00c2\u00a020, 2018, the Commission issued\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0Order\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0Examinations to detect\u00c2\u00a0illicit and\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0deficient violations of\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act\u00c2\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00c2\u00a01325, a)(2) and Rule\u00c2\u00a014 thereunder, ordering the Commission to consider\u00c2\u00a0whether the Commission should consider the Commission's\u00c2\u00a0recommendations\u00c2\u00a0if\u00c2\u00a0conduct\u00c2\u00a0as\u00c2\u00a0relevant to\u00c2\u00a0arrival or inspection\u00c2\u00a0under the relevant federal laws\u00c2\u00a0.\"  The Commission's Complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the Commission"
