  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Gearing, who is charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed on September 25, 2019, alleges that Gearing failed to raise his claim for disability insurance because he was unable to perform any meaningful work.  According to the complaint, Gearing also failed to disclose that he had had a history of lumbar disc disease and that his disability was a \"rare\" condition.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the SEC improperly relied on the testimony of a state agency reviewing Gearing's claims, even though the agency reviewing his claims had not reviewed his claims at the time of his hearing.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the SEC consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Gearing from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and orders Gearing to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Gearing has also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the United States, and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  On March 21, 2020, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against Gearing and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  A hearing for Gearing is scheduled for May 24, 2020.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (Feb. 22, 2020).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, with litigation assistance from Eric R. Werner, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Office of Inspector General. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0"
