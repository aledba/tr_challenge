  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of South Carolina today entered a final judgment against South Carolina-based electronic voting company and its former CEO, Frank Heindel, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbia, South Carolina, alleges that the iVotronic voting machines in use in South Carolina are vulnerable to hacking.  According to the complaint, as alleged in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from at least 2004 through at least 2018, at least 10 of the voting machines were vulnerable to hacks.  In addition, the complaint alleges that at least one of the machines broke down and delayed the counting of votes by at least an hour.  As alleged, the alleged injury to the victims of the alleged hack was so severe that they had to wait several hours to vote.

In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  This action is the latest in a series of administrative actions brought by the SEC and the Department of Homeland Security in this matter.  Among other things, the SEC has issued an order requiring the destruction and destruction of documents related to the alleged hacking of iVOTronic voting systems.  Last week, the Court issued an Order suspending the issuance of the Order from further violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") as well as Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, which requires the SEC to identify and remediate any potential security weaknesses that may be present in the voting equipment. The order also prohibits the destruction, destruction, alteration, or alteration of documents by any third party. The Court's order also requires the defendants"
