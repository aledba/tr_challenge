  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment in favor of a Kentucky family court finding that P.W. and her husband, K.L.W., violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Kentucky, alleges that, in April 2014, the Kentucky Department of Health and Family Services (COHFS) terminated the parental rights of both parents to both children.  According to the complaint, the court found that, despite not calling it a \"domestic violence,\" K.W.'s use of drugs created a risk of harm to the children, and that the child was unable to maintain stability in the home.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the father and mother-in-law of the two children, who were also charged with domestic violence.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the return of the children to their previous foster homes. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas and Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit, with the assistance of staff from the agency's Office of Advocacy and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Kentucky Office of Child and Family Education and the Office of the Attorney General."
