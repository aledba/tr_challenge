According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, from January 2009 through March 2010, Posobilev engaged in a scheme to evade detection and evade detection by foreign authorities. The complaint alleges that, as a result of this conduct, he was sentenced to 135 months in prison and ordered to pay a total of more than $1.3 million in restitution. The SEC alleges that the defendants were not deprived of any \"essential element of the bargain\" when, in fact, they were paid for the parts they supplied. In fact, according to the complaint, the defendants did not have access to ARC's bank accounts at the time of the alleged scheme. Instead, they allegedly used shell companies to pay their invoices to ARC, which was a violation of the federal securities laws. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Abdullaev.
