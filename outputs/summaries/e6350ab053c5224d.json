  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a foreclosure action for a real estate investment property that was foreclosed on by a junior lienholder.  The court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Bayview to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of its profits.  In its judgment, the court found that Bayview had no interest in the property at the time of the foreclosure and that the property was subject to a right of redemption.  Bayview's complaint, filed in federal district court in Portland, charges that, when Bayview purchased the property, it failed to foreclose the property free and clear of any senior lien, and failed to name as a necessary party the owner of the property. The court also ruled that, in the alternative, Bayview could not foreclose against the property without a court order.  According to the court's order, the default judgment was effective as to the parties in the foreclosure proceeding, and Bayview was entitled to redeem the property as to others.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(d) and 13d-1 of the federal securities laws. The judgment also prohibits Bayview from acting as an unregistered broker, dealer, or representative of a broker-dealer, and from participating in the sale of a real property.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (2014).
