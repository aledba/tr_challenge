  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada today entered a final judgment against Christopher Johnson, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 30 months in prison for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Las Vegas, alleges that Johnson failed to disclose to the court that he had a prior felony conviction for possession of a deadly weapon that, in reality, was for a felony.  According to the complaint, Johnson was convicted of a felony in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he was not a \"pre-convicted felon\" for violating those provisions.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to Johnson\u2019s representations on appeal, he received a six-month jail sentence for a previous felony, which he did not qualify as a felony under the categorical approach.  Johnson also failed to show that, as a result of his previous felony conviction, his prior conviction for a wobbler had not constituted a felony, and he was entitled to a mandatory minimum sentence of six months in county jail.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, however, Johnson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of one year and a $10,000 civil penalty.  Additionally, Johnson agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the company of a registered representative.   The court also granted Johnson a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from associating with any third-party, including a broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, or investment adviser.  Finally, the court granted Johnson an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar, and ordered Johnson to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,945, which is equal to the civil penalties that he will be ordered to pay in the future.  On a related note, the SEC's continuing investigation has been conducted in the Office of the United States Attorney for the Central District of California and the Division of Criminal Justice has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them a security deposit using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Nevada State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
