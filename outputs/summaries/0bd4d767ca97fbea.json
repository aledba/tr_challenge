The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that New Mexico violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) of Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on June 18, 2019 in federal court in New Mexico City, the defendants violated Rule 5a-7 thereunder and the securities laws in Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2)(A)(B) and the reporting provisions of Rule 15a-5.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgment of $1,078.71, prejudgment interests of $2,098.81, and a civil money penalty of $100,000.
