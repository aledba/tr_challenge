  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Arkansas today entered a final judgment against Anthony Michael Spears, Jr., a 17-year-old who was charged as an adult with battery in the criminal division of circuit court for engaging in a violent criminal group activity. According to the SEC's complaint, Spears, who was sixteen years old at the time of the offense, was alleged to have acted in concert with Travis Harris and Bret Jackson in causing physical injury to Chance Cooper by means of a firearm on June 12, 2018. The complaint alleges that, prior to the alleged incident, Spears had been arrested and adjudicated delinquent for second-degree battery with an enhancement for a third-degree felony, and that he had been in an altercation with a member of the Britt Street Gang just four days before the shooting.  The complaint further alleges that Spears had observed Harris and Jackson cleaning a gun that night before the incident.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendant had been previously incarcerated as a delinquent for a felony and had his probation revoked three times after that, and was adjudicated juvenile delinquent again in November 2016.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Spears for his role in the alleged conduct.  On June 13, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Spears, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Spears's violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Brooke Digsby and supervised by Spencer L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Shelton. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the U. S. Attorney's Department of New Jersey, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Arkansas Secretary of State's Office."
