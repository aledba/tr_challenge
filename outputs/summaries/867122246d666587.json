  "summary": "On October 6, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, a now-defunct Ohio-based insurance agent, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 30(e) of the agency's contract.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, Smith alleges that, in 2011, representatives from Nationwide recruited him to join its Agency Capital Builder program, in which he was to receive the training and guidance necessary to one day open his own insurance agency.  The complaint alleges that Smith was told that he had only two options when presented with the agreement: sign it, or \"be terminated and forfeit the book of business\" he had built, and to buy two \"small, distressed\" books of business that had been serviced by unsuccessful members of the ACB program.  As alleged in the complaint, however, Smith did not sign the contract and did not receive a copy of the arbitration agreement.  Instead, he allegedly took out a loan to purchase the books and, in reliance on those representations, failed to comply with the arbitration rules and procedures.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Nationwide.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Nationwide agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  Nationwide also agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which is equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
