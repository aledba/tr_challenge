  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against a former Connecticut state employee for his role in a January 2009 automobile accident that resulted in serious injuries.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 7, 2009, Trevor Jones was driving a GMC passenger van that was owned by the defendant when he was hit by the vehicle. The complaint alleges that the defendant failed to demonstrate that an unmarked crosswalk existed at the time he was struck, and failed to show that he was in or very near the spot where the vehicle was hit. The SEC also alleges that Jones failed to adequately record the impact on the roadway, the location of the impact, and the manner in which the van hit the plaintiff.  The SEC alleges that, in its judgment, the defendant was \"at least\" 60 percent contributorily negligent for his injuries and, thus, was barred from recovering damages on the basis of the defendant's negligence in accordance with General Statutes \u00a714\u2013300b.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Jones consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any security deposit or other security deposit. The court also denied Jones' motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for Connecticut today announced criminal charges against Jones.  On May 23, 2016, the SEC filed an amended complaint against Jones, charging him with violating Section 14-300b of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-1 thereunder. The amended complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty.  A hearing on June 24, 2016 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. for the SEC to consider the merits of the amended complaint.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-cv-17-11.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Mr. Werner. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson."
