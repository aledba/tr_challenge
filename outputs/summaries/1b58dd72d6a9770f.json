  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment in favor of the District of Columbia in a civil injunctive action brought by Kelli Linville.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, Washington, alleges that DRS violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Linville, who was a member of the Bellingham School District\u2019s Teachers Retirement System (TRS) in 1976, was denied entry to a second system in which she was eligible to receive a retirement allowance. The complaint further alleges that Linville was not eligible to participate in a third system because she had already accrued sufficient TRS service credits to qualify for a pension allowance from another system. The SEC alleges that the DRS order violated Section 15(b)(2)(A) and Rule 15b2-3 thereunder, and that it violated Section 17(a)(1)(B) and (3)(A)(3)(B). The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC also issued an order suspending Linville from serving as an officer or director of a public retirement system for five years.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the district court has agreed to the entry of an order that permanently enjoins Linville of violating Section 15b-3 of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-4 thereunder and orders her to comply with the court order. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 1, 2012).  The case is being handled by Scott A. Basinger, David A. Kasper, and Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit."
