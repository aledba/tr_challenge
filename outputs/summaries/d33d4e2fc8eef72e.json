  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the California Public Utilities Commission (\"Commission\") for failing to comply with the Commission's order to issue certain rate-of-return support to small independent telephone companies that offer basic local telephone service to customers in rural and remote areas in California.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, charges Siskiyou Telephone Company and Volcano Telephone Company with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the telephone companies.  According to the SEC's order, the Commission failed to comply, relied on an arbitrary theory lacking evidentiary support, reached conclusions not supported by its findings, effectuated an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation, and violated due process and statutory rights.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC and the Commission have agreed to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $197,976 and $55,495.04, respectively, for non-recurring 2016 lost revenues, and ordering the Commission to issue an order appointing a receiver of last resort to determine whether to grant or revoke the receiver's right to access the telephone company's assets.   The Commission's final judgments also order the receiver to send an email to the receiver informing him or her that the receiver has received an email from the receiver. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Barry Fraser and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter in the Los Angeles Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
