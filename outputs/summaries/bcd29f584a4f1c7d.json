  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in favor of GHMSI and Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc., a nonprofit organization that provides health-insurance services and medical services.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., alleges that, in 2011, the Commissioner issued an order requiring GHMS I to maintain a certain amount of excess surplus in 2011 that was appropriate for GHMSi to hold at the end of 2011. The Commissioner's order, which was followed by a subsequent order requiring that the amount of surplus be determined by the District at a later date, was inconsistent with the Commission's prior order requiring the District to maintain that surplus. The Commission's final judgment, which is pending final approval by the court, also required GHMS to maintain its 2011 surplus and to pay a $50 million penalty. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Financial Regulation today announced that it has issued an emergency action ordering the SEC to expedite its investigation.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the Commission has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Health and Human Services (D.C. Department of Insurance) in this matter.  For further information, see Press Release No. 17-369 (Feb. 13, 2009).\u00c2\u00a0On July 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  On July 26, 2019, the court granted the SEC request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered the Commission to conduct an independent examination of the adequacy of the District's surplus and determine whether it is appropriate to allocate a portion of the excess surplus to the District.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Court granted the request for a preliminary injunction, ordering the Commissioner to determine whether the district's surplus is excessive and whether it should be allocated in accordance with its statutory obligations under the federal securities laws.   The court also granted the Commission the right to request a hearing on the merits of the matter before it is decided whether to issue an order imposing an injunction or requiring the Commission"
