  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of divorce against Robyn (Dow) Billing, finding that the court violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Billing filed a complaint for divorce against Dow in July 2017 after seven years of marriage. The complaint alleges that Dow failed to present any evidence that he had created the 401(k) plan during their marriage and that the premarital agreement did not exclude property acquired or created during the marriage. Instead, Dow relied instead on his assertion that separately-owned property, whenever acquired, was to be considered nonmarital property.  The complaint further alleges that, in its judgment, the court found that the parties agreed that they would maintain ownership and control over each of the parties' respective estates and that this was the purpose of the agreement.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Dow consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Dow. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant search tool to quickly identify whether they are eligible to apply for a refund of their investment funds.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that the SEC violated Section 203(1) and Section 9 of the Exchange Act by failing to consider Dow's testimony, offered at the time of the divorce hearing, that he was entitled to a share of the funds for the 401k plan, and that he failed to consider his testimony that the 401K plan was funded, at least partially, with property acquired during marriage.  Further, the SEC alleges that as part of its investigation, Dow provided false and misleading testimony to the court regarding the nature of the settlement agreement and its allocation of funds to Billing's personal benefit.  Dow also failed to provide any corroborating evidence that would have allowed the court to determine whether the settlement was equitable.  Finally, the complaint charges Dow with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The SEC seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties."
