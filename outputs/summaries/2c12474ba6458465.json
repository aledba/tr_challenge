  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alaska today entered a final judgment in favor of the Estate of Steve Cooper and Dorothy Cooper in a civil injunctive action brought by the Coopers.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Anchorage, Alaska, alleges that, in October 2008, the Alaska Attorney General's Office (\"AGO\") issued an emergency action finding that the AGO violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, this finding was consistent with the representations made in the complaint and the judgments and decrees of the court.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the attorney's fees were improperly allocated to certain contract or loan commitments that had a maximum legal interest rate of 10.5% and that they were not entitled to additional attorney\u2019s fees because they had not undertaken a complete review of the laws and the longstanding practice of the lending industry.

As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the court improperly recognized the importance of this finding and issued an order requiring the AGA to consider the issues raised in its complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's Judgment, the AGAs have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of $315,500 plus interest accrued under the 20% rate and under the 8% rate of $46,909.19, and ordering the AGI to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount owed by the borrower and trustee in connection with the foreclosure sale.  Additionally, the Commission has agreed to the issuance of a temporary restraining order and to the payment of civil penalties of $50,000 and $75,000 in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the AG for his role in the alleged scheme.  On May 9, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Alaska alleging that a federal court improperly imposed a default on a loan that exceeded $25,000 when the borrower had defaulted, and that the default could be cured by paying an express rate of eight per cent or higher. The SEC also charged the AG"
