  "summary": "On July 21, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Iowa entered a final judgment in favor of Traci Lee Brooks, a former registered nurse practitioner, in a case brought by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HHSW).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Des Moines, Iowa, alleges that Brooks violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Brooks, who was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, was unable to perform work-related tasks.  The complaint further alleges that Dr. Israel improperly discounted the severity of her impairment, and failed to assign controlling weight to the opinion rendered by the treating psychologist who prescribed her medication.  In a parallel action, on September 21, 2016, the Honorable Judge John E. Sandbothe granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Brooks, ordering her to return to work on a sustained basis.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Brooks consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000, and requires her to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John May, M.D., Kelly L. Gibson, John R. Rymas, and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. May and Ms. Gibson and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Iowa Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Press Release No. 13-20-2014."
