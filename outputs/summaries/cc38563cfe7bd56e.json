  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Allan Neil Castillo for contempt of court for failing to comply with a court order ordering him to pay $24,070.71 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Castillo violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Castillo agreed to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint to the court.  Castillo also agreed to pay a $13,206 civil penalty and to be barred from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Castillo.  On June 2, 2018, the trial court issued an order requiring Castillo to pay all of the liquidator's fees and expenses, including but not limited to: (1) the amount of his contempt, and (2) that he had failed to timely turn over assets and financial records. (3) The court found Castillo in contempt for failure to do so and ordered him to be held liable for all costs, including all future costs, of the court's contempt proceeding. (4) The trial court also ordered Castillo's attorney, Anthony Juneau, Jr., to submit a written judgment of contempt against him. (5) The judgment also imposed a five-day suspension of Castillo and ordered that he comply with the court order appointing him as liquidator. (6) On June 8, 2018 the court granted Castillo a temporary restraining order requiring him to turn over all of his assets, including his bank account statements, to the SEC. (7) On July 3, 2018 Castillo was found in contempt by the court and ordered to pay an additional $14,000 civil penalty. (8) On August 4, 2019 Castillo pleaded guilty to one count of contempt and was sentenced to ten days in prison.  He was ordered to provide Dees with, within five business days of the judgment, copies of all personal bank statements from June 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, where those accounts were used to pay the expenses of CIR, along with complete copies of any cancelled checks and deposit slips on any bank account utilized or maintained by CIR. (9) On September 19, 2019, the court issued a subpoena for the materials requested by Castillo pursuant to the order appointing Dees. The subpoena was later issued without the court finding Castillo liable for any future costs incurred by the defendant."
