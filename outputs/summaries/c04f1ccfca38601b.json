  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jennifer Farley, a former administrative assistant at a locomotive company, for her alleged inability to perform sedentary work due to severe back pain.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Ms. Farley from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Farley began having trouble with her back in 2009 and, as a result, underwent surgical fusion of her spine from L4 through S1. The complaint alleges that, while she was able to stand for an hour in an eight-hour workday, her pain persisted and she had to resort to medication, injections, and physical therapy to quell the pain. In addition, she has sought treatment for migraines and right shoulder pain, as well as depression and anxiety.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Farley. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson, Ms. Gibson, and Ms. Astrue. The case is being supervised by Jennifer A. Furlano, Chief of the Division of Health and Human Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
