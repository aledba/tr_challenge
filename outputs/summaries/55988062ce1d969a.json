  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of a federal court finding that the Department of Health and Human Services violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that, in April 2016, the agency issued a final rule that significantly extended the scope of the exemption and accommodation provisions of the federal health care law. The final rule, which became effective on October 6, 2017, included an exemption for certain religious entities, including certain non-profits, that were eligible to participate in the implementation of the 2017 IFRs. The court found that, contrary to the agency's representations to the public, these exemptions and accommodations violated the federal securities laws.  In its judgment, the court held that the agency had a legitimate interest in ensuring that women covered by any type of health plan receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.

In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On January 9, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the Defendants, charging them with violating Section 5, the securities laws, the federal pre-clearance requirements, and the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of this federal securities law, and with aiding and abetting those violations. The SEC also charged the Defendants with violating Sections 206 and 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The court also issued an order requiring the defendants to provide an accounting of the costs and benefits of their violations of the IFR, and ordered the agencies to submit an accounting for their failure to comply with the"
