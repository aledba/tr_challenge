  "summary": "On March 15, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against CBS Broadcasting, Inc. and its weather anchor, Evelyn Taft, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 425 of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that, in 2010, CBS hired Taft as a weather anchor because she was \"well-liked by [his] co-workers and well-regarded in the profession.\"  According to the complaint, however, after learning that the weather anchor had been hired to replace Johnny Mountain at KCBS and KCAL, the company allegedly refused to assign her cases to her because of her age and gender.  In addition, the complaint alleges that after learning about Taft's employment decisions, he contacted the station manager and was told that he \"knew\" that each of the three men was \"qualified to be a prime-time weather anchor.\"  The complaint further alleges that the complaint alleged that, shortly after the hiring, the CEO began \"quietly interviewing \"young, attractive, buxom\" weather anchors\" and told Hunter \"there was not \"an opening for [him] now.\"  Shortly after this meeting, the plaintiff filed a discrimination complaint alleging that CBS had improperly \"shunned [Hunter] for numerous on-air [weather] broadcasting positions \" due to \"his gender and his age\" and that he had not yet established a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of his claims.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and order them to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  Hunter also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,038, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against CBS for violating Section 425.16 of the Exchange Act and Rules 5a-5, 13a-11, and 13b-13 thereunder and against Hunter for aiding and abetting CBS's violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hunter"
