  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against a former employee of Public Employees' Retirement Association (PRA) who filed a First Amendment retaliation claim against her employer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that former PRA employee Ellie Salemi violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Ms. Salemi was not qualified for the position of Portfolio Manager because she was not experienced enough to perform the duties required by the Exchange Act.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in 2011 and 2012, Salemi complained that her employer, PERA, failed to promote her to the position because she did not perform her duties as expected.  As alleged, in addition to her alleged violations of the First Amendment, she failed to demonstrate that she was qualified to perform her job duties as an analyst.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in her complaint, the court also denied her motion for summary judgment on all of her claims, including her First Amendment and First Amendment claims, and denied her request to submit an EPA retaliation claim.  On May 10, 2012, the Honorable Margaret S. McCole granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval. The court's order, which was entered by the court on May 13, 2013, permanently enjoins Salemi from future violations of these provisions and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Jennifer Paquette, the former head of the Denver office, for her role as an unregistered broker-dealer and for her participation in a scheme to manipulate the market for PRA stock. The complaint also seeks an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, and a bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1771 (March 22, 2012).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Schlegelmilch.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Colorado Secretary of State's Office."
