  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against C.R. Bard Inc. (\"Bard\") for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, prior to the FDA's disclosure of its power injectable port and indicators, Bard and AngioDynamics, Inc. (hereinafter \"Angio) failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims and, therefore, issued a judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) at the close of plaintiff's case. The court granted the SEC's motion for summary judgment on the merits of the case.  In its order, the court found that, based on the evidence presented to the jury, that Bard had violated the anti-infringement provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Angio was entitled to a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Angio has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions and orders it to pay a civil monetary penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for May 21, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 579:20-25.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge David J. Conrrad of the U. S. district court for New York granted the Court's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
