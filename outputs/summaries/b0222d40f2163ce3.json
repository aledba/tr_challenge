  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against five defendants in a health care fraud case brought by the SEC.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Robert Bertram, Robin Peavler, Brian Walters, and Bryan Wood formed PremierTox, Inc., a urinalysis testing company. According to the complaint, Bertram and Walters were doctors and owned a substance abuse treatment company called SelfRefind. The complaint further alleges that the defendants knew the tests were medically unnecessary and did not perform them as required by the federal health care law. In fact, the complaint alleges, as alleged, the defendants delayed the tests for at least ten months and billed the insurance company for the tests even after the tests had been ordered. The SEC alleges that, in addition to delaying the tests, the five defendants also failed to disclose the extreme tardiness of the test results when they received them. The court also found that Bertram violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the defendants' ill-gotten gains plus interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about potential frauds in the healthcare industry.  Investors can quickly and easily check whether a person has been diagnosed with a serious medical condition by using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0In a related case, the SEC filed an enforcement action on May 24, 2018, against a Kentucky-based company that was charged with fraud in violation of Rule 404(b)(10)(C). The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The case is being handled by John R. Rymas, Eric R. Birkenheier, and Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit in the Philadelphia Regional Office."
