  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against K. S. for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, from at least July 2015 through August 2016, K.S., was a member of a hybrid gang known for carrying out car break-ins and carjackings over the past few years.  According to the complaint, the defendants had broken into and stole cars for the benefit of the gang.  K.s. allegedly used different names to refer to their gang, including \"Billy Bad Ass,\" a subset of the Bloods, and \u201cRollin 60s,\u201d which were associated with a similar criminal street gang activity.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants were members of a local gang that had a history of breaking into cars but had escalated to stealing cars and carjacking victims.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed on July 17, 2016, a Douglas County District Court Judge issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order freezing the assets of the defendants and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 bar. The court also granted the defendants the right to return their allegedly stolen cars to their original owners.  On August 2, 2018, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Atlanta announced that it filed criminal charges against K., and the case was being handled by the Atlanta Regional Office and the Georgia Department of Children and Family Services. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Atlanta Police Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Atlanta Field Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-15-11 (2014).  In a parallel action, the Georgia Secretary of State's Office today announced that the SEC has filed a civil injunctive action against K, charging him with violations of the anti-fraud provisions, including, without limitation, violating the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 15("
