  "summary": "The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection today announced that it has filed an emergency action to revoke the general permit of a recycling company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, alleges that, in 2008, the department issued a tentative determination to revoke RCI's general permit and revoke its general permit.  According to the complaint, the hearing officer, Darlene Chapdelaine, represented herself as the sole owner and control person of RCI, and claimed that she would review the record and determine whether it supported her decision.  Instead, the complaint alleges that she did not do so, and instead relied on a false and misleading statement from the department's hearing officer.  In a parallel action, the Department of Health and Human Services today issued a final judgment that permanently restrains RCI from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, RCI has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, and ordering the company to pay an $8,500 civil penalty.  On May 17, 2012, the court granted the company's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered it to comply with the court's order, which requires it to provide a copy of its application for an individual permit and to submit a written response to the court.  A hearing officer who reviewed the application for the individual permit found that the complaint was inconsistent with the facts presented in the record.  As a result of this finding, the company has agreed to a permanent injunction, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to pay civil penalties of $2,500 and $1,500, respectively.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (January 24, 2013).
