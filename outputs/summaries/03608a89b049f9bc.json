  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island today entered a final judgment against a Rhode Island-based physician who was charged with negligent treatment leading to the wrongful death of a husband and wife.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Providence, Rhode Island, alleges that Dawn M. Parrillo, a domestic partner and the administratrix of the estate of Daniel Santos, failed to timely identify all of the potentially responsible parties, including Dr. Gregg, before the three-year statutory period for filing a wrongful death action had expired.  According to the complaint, the medical records she obtained from Rhode Island Hospital were not available at the time of Mr. Santos's death, and they were not immediately available to the family.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in the days leading up to his death, the plaintiff had suspected shortly after his death that his death had been caused by malpractice, and it was those suspicions that drove her to request his medical records.  As the complaint further alleges, however, that the plaintiff simply failed to name all of those potentially responsible for the wrongful conduct.   The complaint also alleges that the hospital did not inform the family of the nature of the alleged misconduct, and that the complaint was not filed until three years after the date the plaintiff received her medical records, when she should have known of the underlying cause of death.  Finally, the SEC's investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center, with the assistance of the Rhode Island Attorney General's Office's Office of Public Health and the Department of Justice's Cyber Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Connecticut Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Office of the Secretary of State's Office."
