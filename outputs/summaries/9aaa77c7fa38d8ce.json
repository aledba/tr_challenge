  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against WNB Group LLC, d.b.a. The Ray Hamilton Moving Company (RH), on Frank's Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act (CSPA) claim.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that RH failed to disclose to Frank the limitations of its insurance coverage before it hired him to move the fountain.  According to the complaint, RH's failure to pay for the repairs was insufficient because it had insurance coverage for the fountain, and the moving company's employees misrepresented after the move that RH would pay to repair the fountain after learning it lacked insurance coverage.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against RH.  Frank's complaint charges RH with violating the CSPA and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, RH has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the federal securities laws, ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $20,000, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against Frank.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1345.02(A).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant a company that failed to pay its insurance for damage incurred to a fountain during the move.  On June 12, 2018, the court entered a consent judgment against RH, finding it liable for violations of the anti-fraud provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(c) and 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13d-1 thereunder, ordering the company to pay $27,000 in civil penalties, ordering RH to disgorge $2,038, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against Frank, ordering him to pay civil penalties of $5,000 each, and requiring RH to pay an amount equal to the amount of the damage incurred.   The court's order against RH was entered by the court on June 13, 2018.  It is not yet known whether the court will determine whether it has jurisdiction to determine whether to impose civil penalties against RH or not, and whether it will determine, based on a reasonable determination, whether to issue a civil injunctive relief order against Frank or not to issue civil injunctions against RH and to issue an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Bierlein and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Ohio Office of Inspector General."
