  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former supervisor of the Chicago Park District for her role in a widespread practice of discrimination against Hispanics.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that the Park District violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from 2011 through 2012, Lydia Vega, then a park district supervisor, was surveilled over 252 times over the course of 56 days by two different investigators. The complaint alleges that Vega was not disciplined at all, and that she was replaced by non-Hispanic employees who were not similarly situated to her.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Vega.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Vega was terminated without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The court also denied her motion for judgment as a matter of law on all of her claims, including that she had failed to show sufficient evidence to justify her termination and that the District Court had improperly granted her a temporary restraining order and ordered her to pay a civil penalty of $750,000, which is the statutory maximum under the federal securities laws.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the New York District Court entered a judgment against Vega that permanently restrains her from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal anti-discrimination laws and ordered the district court to consider the merits of the case. The SEC also issued an order suspending Vega from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  A hearing on May 26, 2018 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. for the SEC to determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 21, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Chicago Police Department, and the Chicago Office of Inspector General in this matter."
