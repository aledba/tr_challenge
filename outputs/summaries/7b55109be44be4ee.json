  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment against Caleb A. Phillips, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for violating the terms of post-release supervision.  The court found that Phillips violated the conditions of his supervision by failing to report to his probation officer and failing to refrain from unlawful conduct.  According to the court's order, which was entered on May 14, 2018, Phillips was ordered to serve a total of 355 days in prison.  As alleged in the order, the court imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of 365 days, which equaled to 355 days served.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Phillips.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Lincoln, Nebraska, charges Phillips with violating the mandatory minimum sentenced by the court.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Phillips consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the provisions of the federal criminal laws, imposes a five-year prison sentence, and requires him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Phillips also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in the offering of a penny stock or penny stock.  Additionally, Phillips agreed to pay $100,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of time he has already served on the probation supervision basis.
