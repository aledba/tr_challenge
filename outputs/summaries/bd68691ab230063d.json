  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan on February 22, 2019 entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins defendant Blair A. Smith from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her sentence.  The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other relief.  According to the court's order, on May 11, 2007, an undercover Kalamazoo Valley Enforcement Team officer spoke with a defendant about purchasing $2,000 worth of crack cocaine. The officer demanded to inspect the crack cocaine before making a payment, and Ms. Buckley came into the room and handed the defendant a brown paper bag. At the time this was equivalent to 2,073 kilograms of marijuana. The court found that defendant Smith was eligible for a discretionary reduction under the First Step Act, but that the same statutory penalties apply to her even accounting for the Fair Sentencing Act's reforms.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Smith consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws. The final judgment also prohibits Smith from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Smith. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, charges Smith with violating Section 3553 of the Exchange Act, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The complaint also seeks a bar against Smith from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and against Smith for violating the mandatory minimum requirements of Section 841(b)(1)(A) and Section 9 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The SEC seeks a preliminary injunction, a civil monetary penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2019 WL 1054554.  On June 11, 2019, the court granted a request by the SEC for an emergency asset freeze against Smith, which was granted by the court on February 2, 2019.  A hearing on June 13, 2019 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m."
