  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans today entered a final judgment in favor of a workers' compensation claim against S&S Janitorial Services, LLC (S&S), a New Orleans-based company that provided floor preparation and cleaning services to Family Dollar stores in New Orleans.  According to the court's order, on October 22, 2014, Ms. Jackson reported that she was injured at a Family Dollar store and suffered a compensable injury. The court found that, by a preponderance of the evidence presented by the injured employee, she was entitled to a $92,278.80 penalty and attorney's fees.  The court also ruled that, in the course and scope of her employment, S & S was not entitled to direct payment of medical benefits to her.  In addition, the court ruled that S& S and Tolito Services were liable for penalties and attorney fees for failure to timely pay indemnity benefits and medical benefits.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  On January 4, 2017, the Honorable Janet M. Bolton of the United States Court of Appeals for the Western District of Louisiana granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order, which requires the Commission to determine whether an employee is entitled to certain type of compensation based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case. The Commission's order also prohibits the Commission from imposing any monetary penalty or attorney's fee on an injured employee. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Janie M. Brunson and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay of the New Orleans Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.
