  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of JCorp and its CEO, YB Dato Kamaruzzaman Bin Abu Kassim, in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Michigan, alleges that from 2013 to 2014, Qandah was falsely told that JCorp was entitled to immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) because it was a foreign state. The complaint also alleges that during her employment with WLC, JCorp, and Kassim subjected her to abusive conduct.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to show that one of the exceptions to the FSIA applies to JCorp or Kassim.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 13(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the SEC.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of International Affairs today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint to the SEC\u00c2\u00a0on the subject matter of the SEC&rsquo;s complaint.\u00c2\u00a0 The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants.   The case is being handled by Jennifer Chloe Groves and Kathlyn Scott, and the litigation will be led by Ms. Groves, Ms. Scott and Mr. O'Bryan. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice in this matter."
