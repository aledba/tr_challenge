  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by Healthcare Systems, Inc., a now-defunct managed care organization.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, beginning in 2012, the D.C. Department of Insurance, Securities, and Banking found that Chartered Health Plan, Inc. was in financial distress and placed the company into rehabilitation, a statutorily prescribed receivership process in which the District's Insurance Commissioner is given broad authority, as the Rehabilitator, to take any action \u201cdeemed necessary or appropriate to reform and revitalize the insurer.\u201d  According to the complaint, the defendants then allegedly sealed the deal by fraudulently inducing Healthcare Systems to consent to Chartered\u2019s rehabilitation.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Healthcare Systems consented to the judgment, which permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On March 1, 2013, a federal district court in Columbia, Maryland, issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the rehabilitation of Chartered, which is subject to court approval.   The court also issued an emergency consent order, ordering the receiver to prepare a plan that would prevent the District from overpaying Chartered for services that it had rendered, and to pay a civil penalty of $'48 million. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Office of Inspector General of the United States Secret Service."
