  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Ronald T. Spoor, Jr., who was sentenced to 360 months of imprisonment and 15 years of supervised release for producing and distributing child pornography.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Spoor violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  Spoor agreed to settle the charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his supervised release.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Spoor.  According to the complaint, Spoor consented to a judgment imposing a penalty of 360 months, which is substantially higher than the statutory minimum of 15 years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint filed in the U. S. District court for the District of Columbia, the court found Spoor liable for violations of Section 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, and Spoor has agreed to a permanent injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of securities in the securities industry, including the securities of publicly traded companies, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  On August 15, 2016, the District Court issued an order suspending Spoor from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to surrender his passport and other documents related to the alleged child pornography case.  To learn more about child pornography, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action on August 21, 2016.  It also instituted an investigation into Spoor\u2019s prior criminal history, including his 2013 conviction for possession of child pornography and a prior felony conviction for child molestation.  Among other things, the investigation was conducted by John R. Kelly and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice in this matter."
