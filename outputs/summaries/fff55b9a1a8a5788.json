  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against a Chicago man accused of sexually abusing a 14 year-old girl.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on August 8, 2014, Andrew Burns, a 23-year veteran of the Chicago Police Department, began his investigation of an aggravated criminal sexual assault that occurred in the vicinity of the 2800 block of West Division Street.  According to the complaint, Geronimo-Ocampo allegedly used a chain link fence to push A.H. out of the way of a gas station and into the open field behind the gas station.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that Geronimos-ocampo then used his other hand to pull her shorts to the side and attempted to touch her on the way out.  A few hours after the alleged attack, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Central District of New York today entered final judgments against Geronimeo-o Campo, who was found liable for the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On August 9, 2016, a federal district court in the District of Columbia entered an order suspending the defendant's bond and ordering him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.   The court's order also temporarily suspended the defendant and ordered him to return to the station where he was arrested on the same charges as the alleged victim. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Rachel E. Morgan and Grace Kena and supervised by Scott A. Kasper.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
