  "summary": "On March 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana entered a final judgment against Amanda Williams, a Shreveport, Louisiana woman convicted of second-degree murder in the death of Bryan Savage. Williams was previously employed as a sitter and sat with Savage's father at Savage's home on Woolworth Road. The court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Williams from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $75,000. Williams agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order. Williams also agreed to be a principal in the commission of an aggravated burglary. Williams and Lewis allegedly entered the house at approximately 3:45 a.m. on February 22, 2016, thinking they were going to knock Savage out if they had to. Instead, they entered the home and found Savage lying face up in the living room. He had a gunshot wound to the chest and his body was partially burned. The jury deliberated for about an hour before finding Williams liable for second degree murder. Williams, Lewis, and their accomplice, Cameron Lewis, were found guilty on the same counts. Lewis was sentenced to serve the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment at hard labor, without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. Lewis, who was later determined to be Williams's father, was also found guilty of second degree felony murder. Lewis pleaded guilty to one count of aiding and abetting Williams' and Lewis's violations. Lewis agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. Lewis consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay $7,500 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against him. Williams has also agreed not to participate in the issuance or purchase of any security or other emergency relief materials. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Phelan with the assistance of the Office of Inspector General's Criminal Investigations. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by David Bonillas and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the SEC's New York Regional Office. The examination that led to the finding of Williams' guilty plea was conducted in the office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York."
