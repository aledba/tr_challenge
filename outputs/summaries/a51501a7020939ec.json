  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a Florida man who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that, in 2005, Berny Serrano, then a junior high school student, and four of his friends decided to rob nineteen-year-old Jacob Langworthy while he was at home alone. After entering Langworthy's home, Serrano held Langworthy at gunpoint while the others ransacked the house looking for drugs and money. The complaint alleges that Serrano then used the victim's family members' testimony to convince the court to impose a life sentence on Serrano. Serrano also alleges that the court failed to consider the impact of the victims' testimony on sentencing, and instead relied on the testimony of Serrano's wife and stepson, who also testified before the court. The SEC alleges that this is a significant error because Serrano was not convicted of any of the charges, and the court had no choice but to impose the life sentence without parole on him. The court's final judgment, which permanently enjoins Serrano from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Serrano to pay a civil penalty of $75,000. The final judgment also orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $10,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment. The judgment also imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of 30 years in prison, with the right to judicial review after twenty-five years.  Serrano has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 921.1401 of the federal securities laws, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Serrano arising from the same conduct that led to the sentencing order. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Justice. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Department of Corrections, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Florida Office of Inspector General, the United States Attorney's Secret Service, and FINRA."
