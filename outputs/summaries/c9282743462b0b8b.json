  "summary": "On August 24, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California entered final judgments against Universal Health Services, Inc. and Stephens Institute, a San Francisco-based art school, for violating the federal incentive compensation ban.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Columbia, alleges that, from 2006 through 2010, the Department of Education (DOE) and its admissions department instituted a new policy to encourage admissions representatives to enroll more students. The policy established an enrollment goal for each admissions representative, and a scorecard system for calculating salary adjustments. According to the complaint, however, the DOE did not require that an individual pay a particular type of claim in full despite knowing that certain requirements were violated. Rather, the complaint alleges that the DOE paid a specific type of payment based solely on their enrollment numbers. The complaint further alleges that in 2006, when the DOE instituted new enrollment incentive policies, admissions representatives stood to gain as much as $30,000 and a trip to Hawaii simply by meeting their enrollment goals. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the DOE from violating the incentive compensation policy, and orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Escobar. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC today announced that it has obtained a court order halting an ongoing investigation by the SEC into the alleged misconduct of the DOE. The investigation was conducted by Scott Rose, Mary Aquino, Mitchell Nelson, and Lucy Stearns and supervised by Marc Blau. The litigation will be led by Ms. Aquino and Ms. Nelson. The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban."
