  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former professional football player who claimed that he was hired by the Indianapolis Colts in California for purposes of providing workers\u2019 compensation benefits.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in federal court in Long Beach, California, Larry C. Tripplett, a former Indianapolis Colts defensive tackle, claimed that the Colts hired him because he was a resident of California when he was performing community service for the Department of Transportation as part of her sentence for a criminal infraction.  The complaint further alleges that, contrary to the representations of the complaint, the Colts did not have jurisdiction over his cumulative injury because he had not entered into any contract with the state when he signed his employment agreement in California.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the complaint also alleges that Tripplet was not eligible for workers compensation because he played two games in California during his career, which contributed to his injury.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, the defendants failed to establish subject matter jurisdiction for their cumulative injury when they signed the contract in California, and that the defendants had no authority to determine whether the contract had been formed in California when they did not.  Tripple has also claimed that his residency in California provides no basis for establishing subject-matter jurisdiction for his claim.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Tripples has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty of $1,000, and a $100,000 civil penalty.  Finally, the court granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 3600.5(a), (c) and (d) and 5305(b).  The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill health, and civil penalties.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge William G. Donnelly of the Southern Division of New Jersey issued a temporary restraining order, ordering the SEC to conduct an investigation into the alleged misconduct of the defendants, and ordering the investigation to be conducted by the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, with the assistance of the Office of Inspector General of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Tripp"
