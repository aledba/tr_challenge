  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Clyde Mitchell, a former Carter County Sheriff's Department employee who was convicted of first-degree burglary in 2013.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ellsinore, Missouri on January 18, 2013, alleges that Mitchell, who lives alone at 47 North Herron Street, was confronted by a \"big, tall figure in full camo\" wearing a mask and a face mask. Mitchell allegedly told the intruder that he was going to tell him the truth about the murders and that he would \"tell us the truth.\" Mitchell allegedly replied that he did not tell the intruder the truth, but rather that the intruder told him that he \"saw two people and then another one came out on the porch and that the other one was shot in the arm.\" Mitchell also allegedly told one group of people that he saw two people lying on the ground and that one of the victims had been shot in his arm. The SEC alleges that, contrary to Mitchell\u2019s claims, Mitchell was not a participant in the burglary and that neither of those statements were true. Mitchell was also charged as a prior and persistent offender with first- and second-degree felony burglary. Mitchell has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 569.160 of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000. Mitchell also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the Missouri Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Mitchell.  According to the SEC's continuing investigation, the agency's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage people to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Scott Frost and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Frost and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.  An SEC examination that led to the examination of Mitchell's background, including his criminal history, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office, and the case has been supervised by Eric Werner of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The investigation was supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit."
