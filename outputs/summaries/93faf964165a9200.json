  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against Ismael Valadez, a Shreveport, Louisiana man convicted of operating a vehicle while intoxicated (DWI), fourth offense.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on December 25, 2016 in the U. S. District Judge's Office for the Central District of New Orleans, Valadeze was sentenced to 15 years at hard labor with credit for time served, and to pay a fine of $5,000.  The SEC alleges that, prior to the amendment to La. C. Cr. P. art. 893 of the federal securities laws, he had been afforded leniency in his three prior DWI convictions and was allowed to plead guilty to having a lower blood alcohol level than the amount shown in the breath test.  As alleged in the complaint, however, as a result of his prior convictions for DWI and DWI, he was improperly sentenced to a 15-year hard labor sentence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Mississippi today announced that it filed a criminal case and obtained a temporary restraining order, an officer-and-director bar, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver's operations.  On January 25, 2018, the court granted the SEC request for an asset freeze and a temporary officer- and director-director-bar, and ordered that the receiver be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(A) and 5(b)(5)(B) and (c) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the receiver has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, orders him to comply with the court's orders, and imposes a $25,000 civil penalty against him.  A hearing on January 26, 2018 is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Louisiana Department of Corrections, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Louisiana State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Release\u00c2\u00a0to encourage the public to check the background of anyone who has been convicted of a felony by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investigational\u00c2\u00a0report to\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of anyone selling or offering them\u00c2\u00a0an investment in a real estate investment\u00c2\u00a0with\u00c2\u00a0a real estate transaction\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0the subject of\u00c2\u00a0that investment\u00c2"
