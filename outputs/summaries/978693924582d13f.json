  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania yesterday entered a final judgment against Andrew Williams, a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for orchestrating a multi-million dollar fraud.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brazoria County, Pennsylvania, alleges that, in the wake of Donna Treesh's death, Williams was falsely told by an analyst that the analyst had performed a test on his blood. According to the complaint, however, the analyst did not perform the test, and Williams was ultimately charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC alleges that Williams violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act by failing to timely file a certificate of analysis with the trial court. The complaint further alleges that the SEC failed to adequately inform Williams of the analyst's background, training, and experience, and that Williams failed to inform the trial judge that he was required to raise any objections at least ten days before trial. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Williams. Williams has agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval. The court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a related administrative proceeding, the U. S. Attorney's Department for the Eastern District of Texas today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Williams, ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and requiring him to provide a copy of the complaint to a trial judge. Williams also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public university and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a law enforcement agency. Williams agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to comply with the relevant provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"). The court also ordered Williams to submit a written objection to the use of the certificate, which would be subject to the court's approval. In addition, the court agreed to an order requiring Williams to provide an accounting of his criminal history, including his prior criminal convictions, and to the appointment of an independent forensic analyst. The order also requires Williams to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of the alleged fraud."
