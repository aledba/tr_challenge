  "summary": "On January 3, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina entered a final judgment against the Guilford County Board of Elections, finding that it was liable for attorney\u2019s fees, expert fees, and costs that should be paid to the parties responsible for enforcing the state-enacted municipal redistricting law.  The court also found that the County Board had no role in enforcing the federal law, and that it could not afford to award fees to the defendants.  According to the court's order, however, the court did not consider the fact that the county Board was not a party to the redistricting law and did not defend it during the litigation.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney General's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants, charging them with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay attorney's fees and expert fees and costs jointly with the parties in the case.  As a result, the Court granted the Citizens\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the defendants\u2019 fees and expenses, and ordered the payment of a civil penalty equal to the amount of their fees.  On January 4, 2018 the court granted the citizens\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, which is pending final approval by the court.  To learn more about the federal district court that issued the injunction, see Litigation Release No. 541 (4th Cir. 1976).  The SEC also issued an order suspending the issuance of an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, ordering the receiver to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and imposing an officer-and-director bar on the receiver.  A hearing is scheduled for February 5, 2019.  For further information, see Judgment No. 17-cv-17 (2014) and Order No. 206 (2014).  For additional information about the Commission on Civil Rights, see Rules No. 13-20, 13-1, 13(a) and 13-11 thereunder, and Rule No. 16-3 thereunder (2013).  In addition, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Secretary of State, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
