  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of a California-based company in a trademark infringement action.  The SEC's complaint, filed on April 11, 2018, alleges that defendant Advanced Aero Paint Technology, Inc. (AAPT) violated the federal trademark registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's order, filed in federal district court in the Central District of Ohio, AAPT claimed that one of its customers was confused when he or she saw Plaintiff's products and exhibit and believed Plaintiff was related to the defendant.  As alleged in the complaint, the complaint further alleges that AAPT's use of the trademark was \"likely to cause confusion, mistake, or deception among the public.\"  The complaint also alleges that the mere presence and creation of its website is not considered purposeful availment to the forum.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of New York today announced criminal charges against AAPT.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, IAP consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  On May 3, 2019, the court granted the SEC and the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the amount of the alleged damages to be paid to the parties in the litigation.  To learn more about penny stock litigation, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1114 (Dec. 31, 2016).  The Court also issued an order suspending the registration of certain microcap issuers, including Apple Inc. v. Apple, Inc., and others, from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a public hearing on the matter.  For further information, see Investor.gov/Investor.gov.
