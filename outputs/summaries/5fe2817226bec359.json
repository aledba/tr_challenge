  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Hartford Casualty Insurance Company, LLC, a Connecticut-based insurance company, for failing to provide coverage for the collapse of a home.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that, from at least 2005 through at least 2014, Hartford violated the federal and state laws by failing to adequately assess the structural integrity of a building's basement walls.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to disclose to the court that, contrary to the defendants' representations, the collapse provisions of the insurance policy expressly prohibited coverage for any material impairment of the building's structural integrity.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the insurance company failed to consider the fact that, in the late 1990s, the plaintiff's home had suffered a genuine or actual collapse, that required an \"abrupt falling down or caving in\" of the home, and that the basement walls were substantially impaired.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hartford consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal, state, and local laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On May 2, 2018, the court granted the complaint against Hartford a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, as well as an order requiring the company to pay a $80,000 civil penalty.   The court also granted the company's motion for summary judgment, which is subject to court approval, on the basis of the facts of the case.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 532 (D. Conn. January 29, 2018).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against the defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to quickly spot signs of a potential collapse.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC today announced that it has obtained an order appointing an independent receiver to determine whether to issue an emergency asset freeze and to provide an accounting of the losses incurred by the victims of the alleged collapse.
