  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment in favor of a New Jersey-based bankruptcy law firm against a New York-based law firm for failing to timely file an adversary complaint.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, on March 2, 2018, Matthew McCann of Liddle & Robinson, New York, filed an emergency action to extend the deadline for filing an adversary action against the firm.  The court found that, contrary to the stated intent of the court, the firm failed to file its complaint before the deadline and instead waited until the evening of the deadline to file it.  In a parallel action, the court issued an order requiring the firm to submit an amended complaint by the date it filed its complaint, which was later approved by the court.  As alleged in the complaint, the filing of the complaint was delayed because of a technical issue with the CM/ECF filing system.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, McCann consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $135,000 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  Liddle and Robinson agreed to settle the case by consenting to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to comply with the court order, and requiring them to provide for an accounting of the firm's assets and liabilities.  McCann also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to a five-year officer-and-director bar, and to pay a $20,000 civil penalty.
