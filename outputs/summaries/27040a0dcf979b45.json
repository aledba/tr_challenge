  "summary": "On June 9, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against Richard Joseph Appellant, Jr., a convicted felon, for the murder of D'Quay Harris.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Appelant, a Texas resident, was indicted for the 2013 murder of Harris by the Rolling 60s Crips.  The complaint alleges that, during the guilt/innocence phase of the trial, he shot at Harris because one of the witnesses was familiar with the 5K1 program and what that meant.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the defendant did not disclose the tattoo to the jury.  Instead, the complaint alleges, he used the tattoo evidence to convince the jury that Harris was not the person who had robbed him and that he was liable for the death of his friend.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed a criminal charge against Appellants, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the antitrust provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the Court granted the SEC and the SEC the right to determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar.  On June 10, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the United States District Court in Houston issued a temporary restraining order halting the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Judge Burt also issued an order requiring the jury to take a picture of the tattoo before it could be used to determine whether to convict the defendant.    The SEC's investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice."
