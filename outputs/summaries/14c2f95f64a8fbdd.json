  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a temporary restraining order against E.G., a 17-year-old from Londonderry, N.H., charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Hampshire, alleges that, on February 10, 2017, Officer Garcia of the New Hampshire Department of Public Safety (DPS) conducted an emergency stop on an incapacitated juvenile who was being questioned by officers in the home of his friend.  According to the complaint, the officers entered the home and questioned the juvenile, who was not in custody at the time of the stop.  Garcia allegedly told the juveniles that he had observed a bag of marijuana in the bedroom, but the marijuana was gone.  He also allegedly asked the juveniles to \"go upstairs\" and \"check out the house.\"  The complaint further alleges that when Garcia questioned the juveniles, all three of them refused to leave the scene.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Hampshire today announced criminal charges against Garcia.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Garcia consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-19 (January 2, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations, with the assistance of trial counsel Robert A. Hannan. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.N. Secret Service's Office of Inspector General."
