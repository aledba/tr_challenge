  "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed a civil injunctive action against Jeremy Woolfenden, the former CEO of TFS-ICAP, LLC, a U.S.-based broker-dealer, alleging that, from at least 2008 to 2015, he induced brokers in New York to fly prices and print fake trades in the foreign exchange options market.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, the defendants engaged in the fraudulent conduct of \"flying\" and \"printing\" trades.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that the defendants communicated to their clients fake bids and offers and fake trades by phone, instant message, and on Volbroker, the broker's proprietary electronic trading platform.  According to the complaint:  The defendants did not, however, directly or indirectly, induce the brokers to trade at times and prices that they would not otherwise have transacted with.  In addition, the SEC alleges that in the course of conducting its investigation, the CFTC obtained a copy of the complaint from a broker, which was reviewed by the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, which issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of flying and printing.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of their respective civil penalties.  On March 21, 2019, the Court granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
