  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant's motion to suppress an out-of-court and subsequent in-court identification of him by an eyewitness.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, on July 31, 2012, a jury found that, in light of recent scientific studies that support the reliability of eyewitness identifications, the jury should consider whether an individual can accurately identify a person who committed a serious crime by using an unnecessarily suggestive identification procedure.  The complaint further alleges that, contrary to the court's finding that the defendant was reliable under the Biggers framework, he was not.  In fact, the court found that the jury could not determine whether the defendant's identification was reliable because the evidence presented to the jury was inconsistent with the testimony of the jury.  For example, as alleged in the complaint, when the jury deliberated on whether to grant the jury's request for a temporary restraining order, the defendant and the jury were told that they would have to show cause and effect, whether to suppress the testimony or not, that there was a reasonable basis for the jury to consider whether the evidence was reliable.   The court also ruled that, as a matter of law, defendants are entitled to present expert testimony on the reliability and accuracy of an identification when there is a substantial likelihood of misidentification.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. \u00c2\u00a0The final judgment also prohibits the defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any security or other security measure, including the purchase of a security deposit, the appointment of a receiver, and the appointment or appointment of an officer or director of a public company.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  To learn more about this matter, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 26, 2019).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of false identifications.  Investor Alerts encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov website\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
