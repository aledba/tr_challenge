  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against the Silberbergs for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that, in 2013, Joanne, Brian, and Jason Silbernberg (\"Silbernbergs\") were the sole shareholders of the Shenandoah Corporation (\"Shenandoah\"), a small family corporation engaged in the ownership and operation of two multi-unit apartment buildings in downtown Alexandria.  According to the complaint, the defendants had agreed to pay annual compensation totaling $60,000 to each of their shareholders, and to pay a total of $189,000 in dividends to all of those shareholders.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and interest.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On June 21, 2016, the court granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants return their allegedly illusory gains with interest, and the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the appointment of a receiver.  Separately, the SEC announced that it had obtained an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the properties in violation of Rule 12(b)(6).  The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review that was conducted by the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations, with the assistance of the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 27, 2016.  To learn more about third-party beneficiary status, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 598 (D.C. 2016).  In its order, the U. S. Attorney's office for the Northern District of Virginia today announced that the SEC has filed a civil injunctive action against the Defendants for violating Rule 12b-6, ordering the receiver to sign a consent judgment that permanently enjoins the receiver from violating the charged provisions, and orders the receiver and receiver to disgorge their gains with prejudgment interest and pay a civil penalty of $192,768."
