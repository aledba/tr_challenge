  "summary": "On May 23, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a former Winston-Salem Police Department officer who conducted a traffic stop in connection with an earlier drug-related arrest.  According to the SEC's complaint, on February 14, 2015, Corporal J.B. Keltner was on the lookout for a gold Kia sedan when he observed a car driving through a red light on Patterson Avenue in Winston Salem, North Carolina.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the traffic stop, Kettner was unable to detect any illegal drugs in the car, and instead conducted a search of the car.  Keltger allegedly asked for a Pennsylvania State I.D. card, which he had not yet returned, and asked for his license and registration.  He also allegedly asked if he could give a ride back to the Green Valley Inn after the search was finished.  As alleged in the complaint, the officer did not have reasonable suspicion to search the car and did not check the driver's license or registration before he conducted the search.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the officer involved in the alleged conduct of the stop.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint filed in federal court in Charlotte, N.C., the court granted the officer\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, entered a preliminary injunction, and entered a conduct-based injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the officer to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Additionally, the court issued an order suspending the search pending further determination by the court on the merits of the matter.  On May 24, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, an order prohibiting the officer from conducting a search without reasonable suspicion, and a court order halting the search of any person who has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and requires him to comply with the court order, and imposes a $2,500 civil penalty.   The court also ordered the defendant to surrender his passport, which was deemed sufficient for the purpose of the search"
