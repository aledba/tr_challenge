  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Vincent Depaul Stredic, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 30 years in prison for his role in a 1999 burglary of a habitation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Harris County, Texas, alleges that, on February 5, 1999, while driving with friends, Christopher Joel Barriere and Rodrick Harris, were smoking PCP inside appellant's car. According to the complaint, when the car stopped at a gas station, the car began to fire. The complaint alleges that the car was being driven by a man who had been previously convicted on felony burglary charges and was awaiting sentencing. As alleged in the complaint:  The car stopped and the defendant opened his trunk and pulled out a loaded shotgun. The defendant raised the gun and charged at the defendant.  As alleged, the defendant was scared when the gun went off the first time, and he was not trying to defend himself with the gun.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Barri\u00e8re, Harris, and another individual for their roles in the scheme of the scheme. The SEC also issued an order requiring the jury to determine whether to consider criminal liability for each of the defendants. The court's order also requires that the jury read the defendant's testimony in written form rather than orally reading it to the jury.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the jury agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The judge also ordered the defendant to pay a $40 service fee to the clerk of the court for clerical duties, including for taxing costs against the defendant).  The jury deliberated for less than two hours before issuing its final judgment, which imposed a permanent injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws. The final judgment also ordered that the defendants be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities for a period of five years, and that the officer and director of a public company be prohibited from soliciting investments in the public company. In addition, the court ordered the defendants' release from prison on a five-year supervised release.  On May 9, 2018, the SEC issued a subpoena for a copy of the subpoena. The subpoena was unsealed on May 10, 2018."
