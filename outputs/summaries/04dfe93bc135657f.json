  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against Janine Orie Melvin, a former secretary in the judicial chambers of her sister-in-law, who was a judge on the Superior Court of Pennsylvania.  The court also issued a temporary restraining order halting Janine\u2019s motion for a writ of habeas corpus.  According to the court order, filed on June 30, 2016, Janine failed to timely respond to a court order recommending her retrial on the 2010 and 2011 charges.  In a complaint filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, the court found that Janine violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered her to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  Janine also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the Court also ordered Janine to comply with a Rule 60(b)(1) order requiring her to submit a written objection to the R&R before it was issued.  On June 29, 2017, the SEC issued its final judgment that permanently enjoins Janine from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to return to the United States to be registered as a lawyer.  It also prohibits her from participating in the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter or offering a penny stock without a copy of the complaint.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 557, 558-59 (3d Cir. 2009).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Mascianica and supervised by Eric R. Werner and Glenn S. Gordon in the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Janine. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office."
