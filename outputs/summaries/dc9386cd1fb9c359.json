  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Purchase College of the State University of York against a student who was expelled from the school for violating the student code of conduct.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, on September 24, 2014, a student at Purchase College was charged with committing four counts of sexual misconduct.  The complaint alleges that Purchase College denied the student's request for a three-hour extension of a disciplinary hearing, which was scheduled for October 6 or 7, 2014.  As alleged in the complaint, the petitioner had been drinking on the night of the alleged misconduct, had been in a two-year relationship with another woman, and had been sexually assaulted by a student the night before.  In a parallel action, the SEC charged Purchase College with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Purchase to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Purchase agreed to the entry of a final judgement that permanently enjoins the student from future violations of the student conduct provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders the college to provide an attorney to assist the student with his or her application for a second disciplinary hearing.  On October 5, 2015, the court granted the college's motion for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the college from imposing any such order, from issuing an officer-and-director bar, from participating in any disciplinary proceeding, and from providing any assistance to the college or university with respect to the matter of whether to suspend the student or issue an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Additionally, the college has agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  Finally, on October 6, the university issued an administrative order suspending the student for a period of three weeks, ordering Purchase to provide him with an attorney, and ordering him to provide the college with an accounting of the amount of money spent on the suspension.  After a hearing on October 7, the school issued an order requiring Purchase to comply with the court's order, ordering the suspension and expulsion order to be immediately followed by an administrative hearing on November 2, 2015.  A hearing scheduled for November 9, 2015 was also scheduled for that date.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Patricia W. Walston and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the New York Office of Education and the Division of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Patricia Walston."
