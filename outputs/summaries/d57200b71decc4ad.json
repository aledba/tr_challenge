  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against Jason Mouelle, a Minnesota man convicted of first-degree premeditated murder of an unborn child.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minneapolis, alleges that, on January 24, 2017, Mouelle consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Minnesota today announced criminal charges against Mouelle arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  According to the complaint, the court found Mouelle guilty on all counts and ordered him to be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, without the option of pre-judgment or officer-and-director bars, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations.  Mouelle also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer and director of a public company and to a five-year bar from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  To settle the SEC\u2019s charges, the defendant agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay a civil penalty, and pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  He also agreed not to participate in the issuance of an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, which would be required by the SEC to determine whether to issue an asset freeze or a temporary restraining order.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Kerstetter of the Court of Appeals granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction, ordered Mouelle to surrender his passport, and barred him from participating in any future securities offerings or offering of securities in the securities industry. The SEC also issued an order requiring the receiver to provide a copy of the complaint to the court for further determination of the merits of the case.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2018 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 24, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans, Chief of the Minnesota Division of Criminal Investigation.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The litigation will be led by"
