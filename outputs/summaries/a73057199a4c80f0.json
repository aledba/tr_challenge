  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment in favor of removing Yorktown clerk-treasurer Beth A. Neff from office for neglecting to perform several of her official statutory duties.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 12, 2017, Neff was elected to serve as the town clerk of Yorktown, Indiana in 2007.  The complaint alleges that Neff failed to reconcile Yorktown's books for all of 2012 and failed to do so for the Town's 2014 annual report submitted to the State Board of Accounts for the Towns.  Neff also allegedly failed to timely reconcile the town's financial records for forty-eight consecutive months.  As alleged in the complaint, this is a violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Indiana Code, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 5(a) and 5(c) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the court entered a judgment against Neff, permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, and ordering Neff to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $150,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against her.  On August 2, 2018, the federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, entered a temporary restraining order and order freezing Neff's assets and prohibiting her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the municipal securities laws. The court granted the court's request for an asset freeze and an officer-and-director bar, and ordered the court to determine the amount of disgorgement and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the court.  A hearing scheduled for August 13, 2018 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-11-1 (a)(2).  The SEC's Complaint charges Neff with violating Sections 5, 5, and 6 of the Illinois Code and with violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgements of ill-will, and civil monetary penalties. The case is being handled by Scott A. Basinger of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Indiana Secretary of State's Office."
