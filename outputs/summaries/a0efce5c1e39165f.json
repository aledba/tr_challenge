  "summary": "On December 11, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi entered a final judgment against Rashad J. Smith, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to fifteen years as a habitual offender in the Lincoln County Jail.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that on August 16, 2015, Smith was tried in Lincoln County Circuit Court on a two-count indictment that charged him with possession of marijuana in the jail. The complaint alleges that Smith, by his own actions, used a jail uniform and a jailissued mat to conceal his possession of a cell phone, which he claimed was an essential element for the different crime of grand larceny.  According to the complaint, Smith's arrest warrant, which was issued on September 28, 2015 and unsealed on June 26, 2017, required Smith to surrender his cell phone and other electronic devices, including a Nokia Smartphone, black in color bearing the IMEI number 353047069216952, before he was re-incarcerated upon his surrender.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Smith consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Smith arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On December 12, 2018 the Honorable Kathleen M. McCollum of the Mississippi Court of Criminal Appeals issued an order suspending Smith from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The order also prohibits Smith from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock. The court also ordered Smith to comply with the SEC bar against him. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mississippi Attorney General's Office, and the Mississippi Department of Corrections in this matter."
