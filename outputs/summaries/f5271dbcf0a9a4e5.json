  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Point Blank Enterprises, Inc., a Florida-based manufacturer of ballistic vests, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that Point Blank, which manufactures and sells \"Self-Suspending Ballistic System\" vests (SSBS) that are manufactured and sold in the United States and the District of Columbia, has failed to adequately represent the safety risks posed by the defective vests.  According to the complaint, as a result of its failure to adequately demonstrate that it had sustained any injury, it has not had standing to bring claims for injunctive relief.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants have not adequately represented to the SEC that they had suffered an injury from the defective SSBS vests and that they have not purchased or used any of the vests in the class.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Point Blank has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $5,000,000 and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the judgment orders Point Blank to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 penalty in the amounts of $2,500 and $1,500, respectively, for each of the defendants' alleged injuries.  To learn more about self-sustaining injunctions, see Litigation Release No. 5206103 (Aug. 2, 2014).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant a company that purchased and/or used new SSBS vest vests from Defendant.
