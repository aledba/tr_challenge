  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Pietrina Cecilia Hoffman for endangering the welfare of children.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on December 6, 2016 in federal court in Philadelphia, Hoffman agreed to a judgment of acquittal on the convictions for third-degree murder and aggravated assault, concluding that the Commonwealth had failed to present sufficient evidence of malice to justify the imposition of a sentence of five years and nine months to 12 years of incarceration.  The court also granted Hoffman's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and for aiding and abetting Hoffman's violations of Section 5 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Hoffman also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her sentence.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Hoffman and ordered her to surrender her passport.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hoffman consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On November 21, 2017, the Court entered a judgment against Hoffman, finding her liable for a five-year and nine month prison sentence, ordering her to serve a total of 10 years and 12 months, and imposing a $10,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Justice, and the Pennsylvania State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
