  "summary": "The Louisiana State Board of Examiners of Psychologists today announced that it has obtained a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana, alleges that Eric R. Cerwonka, a licensed and practicing psychologist in Louisiana, violated the due process provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that James R. \"Jim\" Raines, a member of the same law firm as the Board's attorney, served as prosecuting attorney.  According to the complaint, Mr. Raines and the Board were not impartial as required by the federal law and did not participate in prior investigative proceedings.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Board has agreed to the final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of its due process provision.  In a second administrative proceeding, the court issued a judgment on July 26, 2017, ordering the Board to conduct a second hearing in which it would not use a Board attorney and a presiding officer from the same firm, and ordering that the Board not use the same presiding officer or attorney from the prior hearing.  On August 5, 2016, the district court issued an order that permanently restrains the District Court's order against the Board, ordering it to conduct its own independent review of the record, and appointing a prosecuting attorney as an independent judge.   The final judgment also orders that the court appoint a receiver to determine whether to issue an order appointing a receiver of the receiver, and appoint an attorney to handle the receiver's duties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Allison, Amy Groves Lowe, and Lloyd Lunceford of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Allison and Ms. Lowe. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Louisiana Office of Inspector General in this matter."
