  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment in favor of a former employee of a Corydon, Indiana-based company who alleges that he was unlawfully terminated because of his race.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 5, 2010, former employee Reginald Baker was placed on involuntary medical leave by his employer, Roman Marblene Co, Inc., for failing to perform all of his work duties, including operating a gel-coat sprayer, setting up molds, and installing hats on casted molds.  Baker was the first salaried employee to be permanently terminated by the company.  The complaint alleges that, in 2005, the company purchased Baker, who was the only African-American employee of the company at the time.  As alleged in the complaint, Baker had an automobile accident and was placed under a doctor's care for one week due to an injured hand.  Despite repeated requests to return to work, Baker was not able to perform any of his job duties despite repeated requests.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Indiana today announced criminal charges against Baker.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, which was filed in federal district court in Indianapolis, the court issued an order requiring the company to cease and desist from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and requiring it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 27, 2016, the Court granted the company's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered Baker to comply with the court's order, and ordered him to pay $96,228.40 in lost wages and a $10,000 civil penalty.  After a hearing on June 5, 2017, the Honorable Kathleen M. Welshhans of the Court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the company from future violations of the federal and state laws, and orders it to conduct a factfinding hearing.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Wiseman, Jason Lawalin, and Jamie Carney of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by John Rymas. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Indiana Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the Indianapolis Police Department, the FBI, the IRS Criminal Investigations, the Missouri State Attorney General's Office, the U."
