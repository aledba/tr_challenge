  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against CNY Centro, Inc. (Centro) for violating the duty of fair representation.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, on October 5, 2007, Centro terminated Eugene Palladino, a bus driver for nearly 25 years prior to his termination in September 2008.  The complaint alleges that, in October 2007, when he telephoned the dispatch office approximately three hours before his scheduled run, he advised the dispatcher that he was not going to make his run because he had been called out of town the previous night and would not make it back in time.  As alleged in the complaint, however, that this was planned in advance and that he had made false representations with respect to the circumstances surrounding his absence.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending all members of a voluntary unincorporated association for five days, placing him on lifetime probation, and barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On August 19, 2008, the court granted a request for a temporary restraining order and ordered a preliminary injunction against violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the settlement to be approved by the court at a later date.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, the settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission in this matter."
