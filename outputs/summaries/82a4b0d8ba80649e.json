  "summary": "On March 11, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California entered a final judgment against California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and two other state attorneys general for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that California passed the Presidential Tax Transparency and Accountability Act in 2017, which requires candidates for federal office to disclose their tax returns for the previous five years as a precondition to appearing on the State's primary ballot for the 2020 presidential election.  According to the complaint, the Act imposes significant restrictions on the ability of eligible candidates to participate in the primary election, including requiring candidates to provide detailed financial information concerning their potential conflicts of interest, business dealings, financial status, and charitable donations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the California attorney general's office and the California Secretary of State's Office have agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the Attorney General to issue an order imposing a preliminary injunction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the two California attorneys general.  On March 13, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against California attorney General Alex Padilla, charging him with violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  Padilla has agreed to a permanent injunction, to be followed by the appointment of a receiver, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Separately, Padilla agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  This settlement, which is subject to court approval, is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in this matter."
