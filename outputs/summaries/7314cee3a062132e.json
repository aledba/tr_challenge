  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon for his role in a series of vehicle break-ins.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on October 8 and 14, 2016, the operator of a training course for commercial truck drivers imposed a $1900 fine on its student for the loss of a paperback study guide, a multiple of the full cost of the course that included the guide. The study guide was in a backpack stolen from the student\u2019s parked car. The complaint further alleges that Roache stole the study guide and used it to make a fraudulent $1900 restitution award.  According to the complaint, Roache agreed to the $1900 penalty without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Roache also agreed to pay $958.72 in restitution, which is equal to the amount of his civil penalty, and $19,763 in restitution.  In its judgment, the court found Roache liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Roache to pay a civil penalty of $1900.  Additionally, the Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order against Roache and ordered him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $959.72, a total of $1,929.71, and a civil penalties of $859.71 and $876.78, respectively.  On November 2, 2017, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Gershfeld of the Federal Court in Des Moines issued an order suspending Roache from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The court also issued a preliminary injunction, which temporarily halted the suspension of Roache, ordering him to comply with the SEC's order suspending him from appearing, practicing, or appearing before the court as a lawyer, and imposing a $20,000 civil penalty against him.  A hearing on November 13, 2017 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Iowa Secretary of State's Office.
