  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered final judgments against the Louisiana Department of Revenue, State of Louisiana, and the Louisiana Secretary of State in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, in 2002, the Louisiana Legislature passed a law that prohibited the imposition of sales taxes on medical devices, including pacemakers, stents, artificial limbs, and other medical devices.  According to the complaint, the Legislature and the people did not import any statutory definition of \"prescription drugs\" when they passed the law.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the Legislature imposed a temporary sales tax exemption on pharmaceuticals and medical devices in violation of the federal securities laws.  As alleged, the exemption for medical devices was not in place at the time.  In addition, the SEC alleges that in 2016, the state legislature suspended nearly all exclusions and exemptions from two pennies of Louisiana sales and use tax and added an additional penny, which was imposed with a similarly reduced set of exemptions and exclusions.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of $145,719.00 plus prejudgment interest of $2,038.00, a civil monetary penalty of $160,000, and a penny-settling bar against the defendants from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization.  On June 30, 2018, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, which is subject to court approval, to proceed with the litigation against the Defendants.  This case is being handled by John R. Rymas of the New Orleans Regional Office, under the supervision of C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New Orleans and the Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
