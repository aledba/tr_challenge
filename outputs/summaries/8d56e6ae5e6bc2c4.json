  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a trustee's motion to dismiss a medical malpractice claim filed by a former trustee of a bankruptcy estate.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that the trustee failed to adequately consider the facts presented in the complaint.  According to the complaint, the trustee's failure to disclose a potential medical liability was the result of an improper application of judicial estoppel to a bankruptcy trustee pursuing a claim not disclosed by the trustee.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to the defendants' representations to the court, the bankruptcy trustee never took an inconsistent position in pursuing the potential claim.  As a result, the court's decision to grant the trustee the right to proceed with the litigation was inconsistent with the standard of review applied to the trustee in the bankruptcy case.  For example, the SEC's order granting the trustee a temporary restraining order against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The judgment also orders the trustee to be judicially estopped from pursuing the purported medical liability claim against the trustee based on his or her receipt of a court order suspending the trustee from pursuing it.  On the same day that the court granted the trustee relief, a federal judge issued an order denying the trustee an emergency court order halting its pursuit of the alleged medical liability. The court also ordered the trustee not to obstruct the bankruptcy proceedings of the trustee and to appoint a trustee to handle the estate's assets.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  To learn more about bankruptcy relief, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 24, 2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit.
