  "summary": "On March 11, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California entered a final judgment against California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and two other state attorneys general for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that California passed the Presidential Tax Transparency and Accountability Act in 2017, which requires candidates for federal office to disclose their tax returns for the previous five years as a precondition to appearing on the State's primary ballot.

The Court also ordered the Defendants to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the penalty imposed by the Commission on the Qualifications Clause of the Federal Election Act of 1940 (\"ECFEA\").
