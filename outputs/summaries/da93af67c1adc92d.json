  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of South Carolina today entered a final judgment against Jermaine D. Grier, a former prisoner of the Lancaster County Detention Center, for possession of contraband by a county or municipal prisoner.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbia, South Carolina, alleges that Grier violated the antifraud provisions of Section 24-3-965 of the South Carolina Department of Corrections.  According to the complaint, on November 16, 2015, Grier was indicted on possession of a piece of a pen that appeared to have been sharpened down to the tip.  Grier agreed to be sentenced to eight years of imprisonment, with the option of a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for South Carolina announced criminal charges against Grier.  On May 24, 2016, the SEC filed an emergency action charging Grier with possession of the contraband in violation of Sections 24-7-155 of the state's Criminal Code and Rules of Practice.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public prison for five years.  Additionally, the court granted Grier's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product, including the right to a jury trial, a penny stock bar, and a bar on the purchase and sale of a gun.  As part of the settlement, the judge also agreed to the imposition of permanent injunctions, to be followed by a hearing to determine the amount of restitution to be paid, and to a penalty to be determined by the court upon motion of the court.  A hearing scheduled for May 25, 2018, is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 24-6-155 (Supp. 2018).  The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Amy C. Welshhans, Regional Director of the Department of Health and Human Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
