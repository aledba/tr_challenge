  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered final judgments against Avon Realty Holding, LLC, a Lorain County nursing home, and its owner, Michael Francus, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dayton, Ohio, on January 10, 2017, the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) issued an order requiring the director of health to approve a certificate of need application for a long-term care facility.  The order requires the director to determine whether a specific provision of the federal securities laws applies to a specific nursing home or nursing home.  For example, the order requires that the director consider whether there is sufficient working capital to support the relocation of nursing home beds from a closed county nursing home to a newly constructed nursing home on the Avon Health Campus.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Avon REalty Holding consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
