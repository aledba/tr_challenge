  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a temporary restraining order against Phillip Jazir Thompson, a convicted felon who was sentenced to a five-year term of supervised release.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Thompson violated the fugitive tolling doctrine, which requires that a defendant be a fugitive for purposes of tolling when he reentered the United States but refused to submit to supervision.  According to the complaint, Thompson was arrested in Florida in June of 2010 and was later convicted of drug and weapons charges. The complaint alleges that, while incarcerated, Thompson had been ordered to report to his probation officer by no later than December 2014, when he was already in the country and concealing himself from supervision. The SEC also alleges that by the time Thompson was released from prison in 2011, he had completed a 180-month prison sentence and was about to reenter the country for a second time.  Thompson has not challenged the court\u2019s finding that he was not a fugitive from supervision, but instead used aliases to evade detection by law enforcement and probation.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained a court order suspending Thompson from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a federal securities order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, however, Thompson has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 30 months and a $250,000 civil penalty. The court also granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze against Thompson.  On May 25, 2011, the court entered a warrant for Thompson's arrest in Florida, and Thompson was subsequently arrested and sentenced to 30 months in prison. On June 16, 2017, the district court issued an order suspending the supervised release term for Thompson and ordering Thompson to report for supervision within 72 hours of his release. On July 17, 2018, Thompson pleaded guilty to one count of aiding and abetting a federal criminal charge, and the court found that Thompson had violated his supervised release conditions. The judge granted the court's order and ordered Thompson to comply with the court order, which also requires him to report promptly to probation. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Office of International Affairs, and Timothy J. Walker.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Jennifer C. McKinley of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Mr. Walker, and supervised by"
