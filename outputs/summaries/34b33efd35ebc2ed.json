  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against the Board of Adjustment (BTA) for improperly failing to determine the proper allocation of the sale price of a nursing home property.  The BTA's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins Arbors East from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the BTA to submit an appraisal of the nursing home for tax year 2011, a reappraisal year in Franklin County, and a valuation complaint filed in the District of Columbia.

It also ordered Koon to pay disgorgment of $4,640,000, which represents approximately $1.8 million in prejudgment interests, and to pay civil penalties of $1 million.  Additionally, Koon consented to the appointment of a receiver of the real property, which requires him to provide a copy of the BOR's order to the receiver.
