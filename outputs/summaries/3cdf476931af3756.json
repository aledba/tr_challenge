  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was precluded from being placed in the custody of his children because of jurisdictional issues.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, on February 15, 2013, the defendant, Christian D. of Colima, Mexico, claimed that his son D'Anthony and five-year-old daughter Dalia were removed from their mother's custody because of physical abuse and drug use by their father.  The complaint further alleged that the defendant repeatedly hit the children with a belt in Mexico when he urinated on the living room floor, and frequently left the children unattended to roam outside the apartment.  In addition, the complaint alleged that father had used a \"kush\" marijuana pipe in Mexico, which was the cause of his noncustodial status, and that he had been smoking marijuana in Mexico.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, D. and Dalia consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  D. agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer and director of a public company.  On May 24, 2013 the U. S. District Judge for the Central District of California entered a judgment against the defendant that permanently restrains the jurisdiction of the court, orders the court to consider the merits of the case, and imposes a $25,000 officer- and director bar against him.  A hearing for the defendant was scheduled for May 24.  After the hearing, the court granted the defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered the defendant to surrender his passport, and ordered the child to be placed in his or her parent's custody.  As part of the settlement, the judge granted the mother's request for a temporary restraining order against further violation of the anti-fraud provisions, ordered that the child be placed with a \"nonoffending parent\" and that the court will determine whether to place the child with a custodial parent at a later review hearing.   The court also denied the father's request to be removed from the family. "
