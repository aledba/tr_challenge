  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Vacation Properties, Inc., a now-defunct vacation-sales franchise, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that Karen D'Onofrio, a sales representative for Vacation, was not entitled to the right to compete with Vacation in any job related to sales or marketing of cruises, escorted or independent tours, or resort stays.  According to the complaint, instead, Karen was required to participate in business relationships with other Vacation employees, including by attending a CruiseOne training.  In addition, Karen allegedly failed to disclose her ownership interest in the CruiseOne franchise and the fact that she was using her FMLA leave to support her husband's business ventures.  Vacation's complaint charges Karen with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Exchange Act Rules 10b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Karen consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $50,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Ray and Paul G. Sansone of the Fort Worth Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Office of Inspector General in this matter."
