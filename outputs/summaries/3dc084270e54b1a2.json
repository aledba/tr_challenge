  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Delaware County judge who dismissed a debtors' motion to voluntarily dismiss their bankruptcy case.  The court entered the final judgment on May 17, 2017, that permanently enjoins Murphy from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $35,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Murphy.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on or about November 24, 2004, Murphy filed a petition to have Judge FitzSimon revoke her May 17 Dismissal Order, which had been issued by the court in a default judgment against the Debtor and her now ex-husband.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Murphy has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions, ordering him to comply with the court's order, and appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the debt.  Murphy has also agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a hearing on May 10, 2019, that will determine whether to issue a judgment that imposes permanent injunctions against Murphy, and that the court will consider a motion to revoke the judgment.  On May 31, Murphy also filed a second complaint seeking to have the court revoke the earlier judgment against him.    The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Philadelphia Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
