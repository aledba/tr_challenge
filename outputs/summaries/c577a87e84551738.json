  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against a Connecticut man accused of attempting to steal a car and driving it into an apartment complex.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut, alleges that Kristopher Pryce, a resident of East Hartford, and his friend, Juan Carlos Zavala, entered the Summerfield apartment complex on February 26, 2013, intending to steal the car and drive it into the apartment complex to steal it. According to the complaint, the two teenaged males tried to enter the apartment through the back door, but were stopped by the apartment's security personnel. The complaint further alleges that Pryce and Zavalas confronted the two and tried to get inside the apartment, but the two men refused to let them in. Instead, the complaint alleges, Pryce drove the two out of the apartment and into the street, where they engaged in a physical fight. The SEC alleges that the defendants entered the apartment with the intent of stealing the car, and that they used the bat to attack Clemente, who was having a fight with her stepfather, Jonathan Lopez. In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Pryce that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunction. The court also ordered Pryce to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related matter, the SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Philadelphia Regional Office. The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Mr. Williams. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
