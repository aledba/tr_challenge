  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against Antoine Myles, Jr., a convicted felon who was later sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in a drug-trafficking organization that he and his brother formed in 2004.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in North Carolina, alleges that Myles violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he failed to adequately explain his decision to impose a life sentence.  According to the complaint, Myles was responsible for distributing at least 43.6 kilograms of cocaine base and 504.6 grams of cocaine, in addition to 46.83 grams of marijuana.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for North Carolina announced criminal charges against Myles on June 5, 2015.  On June 6, 2016, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Myles to surrender his passport and return to the U. S. to be registered as a broker of securities.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and imposes a $500,000 civil penalty.  Myles also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order.   The court also agreed not to impose the mandatory minimum sentence of life imprisonment, which is required by the federal law.  Finally, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 26, 2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Attorney General's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
