  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada today entered a final judgment against TitleMax of Nevada, Inc., a Nevada-based title lender, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's order, TitleMax offered a 210-day title loan to its customers in 2014 and 2015. The complaint alleges that TitleMax failed to ratably and fully amortize the entire amount of principal and interest payable on the loan and instead charged additional interest.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Las Vegas, charges TitleMax with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (d) of\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act of 1940, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Nevada today announced criminal charges against the company.  To learn more about TitleMax's alleged violations of the federal securities laws, see Litigation Release No. 604A.445 (3) and (4) and Rule 206(4) thereunder, and the SEC seeks a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of TitleMax&rsquo;s violations of Section 206(1), and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Titlemax consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 2, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court in Nevada, seeking a preliminary injunction, an order requiring TitleMax to cease and desist offering the GPPDA, and a court order requiring it to comply with the relevant provisions of the relevant federal statutes. The SEC previously issued an order suspending TitleMax from offering or renewing any title loan after the SEC found that it had violated the reporting provisions of Sections 5 and 5 of the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser Rules\u00c2\u00a05 and\u00c2\u00a0Section\u00c2\u00a06 of the Commission's Rules of Practice.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson."
