  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Wallace Raymond Crooks, a Colorado resident who was charged with distributing crack cocaine in violation of the federal securities laws. According to the SEC's complaint, from January 1999 through May 1999, Mr. Crooks was involved in a distribution of crack cocaine from the Raintree Apartments in Pueblo and Colorado Springs, Colorado. The complaint alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, the defendants were involved in the distribution of more than 50 grams of crack, and that the amount of the crack cocaine they distributed was substantially higher than the statutory penalties. In addition, the complaint alleges, defendants were charged with distribution of \"50 grams or more\" of crack without being convicted of a specific drug-related felony. The SEC alleges that defendants were not entitled to resentencing under the Fair Sentencing Act because they were never intended to benefit from the federal sentencing laws. In fact, according to the complaint filed in federal court in New York, defendants who were found guilty of the same felony were not eligible for resentencing because they had already been sentenced to life imprisonment. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Crooks.  The SEC's Complaint, filed in the U.N. Office of Justice, charges Crooks with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The Complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order, an officer-and-director bar, and an officer and director bar.  In a related matter, the Court issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver. The receiver has agreed to the appointment of a receiver under the receiver, and the receiver will determine the receiver's penalty based on the specific conduct committed by the receiver in the violation.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Crooks consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the Federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer- anddirector bar. The settlement is subject to court approval. The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of the Commodity Futures Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force. The litigation will be led by Mr. Wirsing and Ms. Sansone. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the CFTC"
