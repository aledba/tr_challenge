  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against a Harrisburg, Pennsylvania man who was sentenced to a prison term of fifteen to thirty months without credit for time spent in custody.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Harrisburg on March 9, 2017, Zamir L. Appellant, a 17-year-old from Pennsylvania, was arrested and incarcerated at South Mountain Juvenile Detention Center, where he was later sentenced to one-and-a-half to five years imprisonment.  The complaint alleges that the trial court improperly focused on the fact that the defendant was in custody and did not grant credit for the time he spent at the facility, and instead focused on whether he spent time in a \"custody\" rather than a \"prison.\"  The court also ruled that the defendants were not entitled to credit under Section 9760(1) of the Juvenile Act, and that the amount of credit they were entitled to was discretionary rather than mandatory.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Appelant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 9 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Appellants consented to the entry of a final judgement that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On May 22, 2018, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, which requires the court to determine whether to grant credit to a defendant based on his prior criminal conviction, ordering him to be confined to a secure juvenile detention facility until he waived his charges to the adult criminal justice system, and requiring him to surrender his firearm and surrender his passport in order to obtain a court order prohibiting him from purchasing or selling any firearm in the future.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
