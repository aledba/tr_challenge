  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against the Estate of Gary Guyaux and his wife, Christy Guyaux, in an equity action brought by the Township of North Fayette.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on December 7, 2016, in a federal district court in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, the Township obtained an emergency court order granting the Township's request for an asset freeze and other emergency relief.  The complaint alleges that the Township unlawfully obtained a temporary restraining order and an order requiring the Township to remove the firearms from the property.  In its order, the court granted the Township and the Sheriff's Office the right to return the firearms to the Township.  On June 9, 2017, the trial court issued an order that permanently enjoins the Township from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the Township, the Sheriff, and the County Sheriff to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoined them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordered them to pay disgorgement of $10,459.10, prejudgment interest of $2,592.96, and a civil penalty of $20,000.  Additionally, the judge granted the township's request to bar the Guyaux siblings from purchasing or selling any of the property, including the property of their mother, who was the only individual who resided at the house at the time of the alleged violations.  As a result, the township has not obtained a court order to permanently enjoin theGuyauxs from purchasing, selling, or otherwise acquiring any firearm, and has not issued any order appointing a receiver for the property until the litigation is completed.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Philadelphia Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
