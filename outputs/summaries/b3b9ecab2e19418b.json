  "summary": "On October 15, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against Christine Foxen, a California resident, her former attorney, John Carpenter, Paul Zuckerman, Nicholas Rowley and Carpenter, ZUCKerman & Rowley, LLP, who had represented her in a personal injury action. The court found that Foxen violated the antifraud provisions of Section 340.6(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered her to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,180,287.85.  The court also ordered Foxen to pay $840,000 in attorney fees and $360,000 for consulting fees.  According to the court's order, Foxen did not learn of the alleged misconduct until she confronted her former attorneys about the matter and confronted them with the facts.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $934,141.95 and $846,000, respectively.  Foxen also agreed to be permanently barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Foxen. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by John Carpenter. The case is being supervised by Gregory A. Kasper. The Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the California Office of the Attorney General."
