  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against Donald and Kimberly Bush, who filed for bankruptcy in 2013.  The court entered the final judgment on the merits of the case against the Bushes.  According to the court's order, filed on July 7, 2015, the Bushehes filed a civil injunctive action against the Internal Revenue Service, alleging that the IRS demanded that they pay $107,000 in taxes, plus a $80,000 fraud penalty, for tax years 2009, 2010, and 2011. The court ruled that the amount owed in taxes and penalties was not related to the estate's bankruptcy obligations, and instead was determined by a bankruptcy judge.  In a parallel action, the United States today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order to expedite the filing of its final judgment, which is subject to approval by the court.  On February 22, 2019, the court issued an order suspending the settlement pending final approval of the court order.  To learn more about bankruptcy relief, see Litigation Release No. 566 (2014).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Columbia, charges:  The Bushes with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Court has entered an order permanently enjoining the settlement from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the settlement to be approved by a court at a later date, and ordering the payment of civil penalties in a parallel proceeding.  Separately, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court of Appeals for the Northern District of Illinois has issued an Order appointing a receiver to determine the amount of assets owed by certain creditors in bankruptcy.  Sansone and Sansone agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of an order imposing a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of bankruptcy. The order also requires the bankruptcy judge to determine whether to issue an order appointing an officer or director of a public company that will pay a $100,000 civil penalty in a matter that is unrelated to the bankruptcy proceeding. The Court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and a temporary asset freeze, and ordered the bankruptcy court to consider the alternative to resolving the tax debt by a judge of the tax court serving under Article I."
