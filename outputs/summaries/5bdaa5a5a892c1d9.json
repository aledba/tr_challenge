  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against three defendants who were convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1519 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the defendants violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws by failing to disclose that they had engaged in a coordinated cover-up to obstruct an investigation into whether Carrillo had committed a serious felony.  According to the complaint, the defendants told the court that they would use excessive force to punish Carrillo if he was not in handcuffs.  Instead, the complaint alleges that Carrillo was restrained and restrained by two other officers, Fernando Luviano and Sussie Ayala, who were also present at the scene.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Carrillo.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the three defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently rest their convictions on the basis of the evidence presented in the SEC\u2019s complaint, which was filed under seal in the federal district court for New York on May 24, 2017.  On June 5, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $75,000.  A hearing for the final judgment is scheduled for July 26, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action on June 13, 2018 against two of the defendants for violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Exchange Act and Rules 5b-5 and 5c-8 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-to-officer and conduct-based injunctions against further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation of Carrillo's alleged misconduct was conducted in the Office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida, and the case was supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigation. The SEC examination, which is continuing, has been conducted by David A. Kasper and Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The case is being supervised by Chedly L. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter"
