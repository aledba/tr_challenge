  "summary": "On October 26, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against RDS, Inc., a Chicago-based company that was charged with failing to pay Raul Laguna's medical bills.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that RDS violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, RDS failed to disclose to the Commission that Raul was a dependent when Raul died and failed to pay his medical bills until Raul's death.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, after Raul passed away on September 14, 2013, he was not entitled to benefits after RDS adopted him following his father's death, and RDS did not issue him death benefits until age 18 or, if he is enrolled in an accredited educational institution, until age 25.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins RDS from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay $17,570.61 in disgorgement, $1497.60 in prejudgment interest, and a $15,560.10 civil penalty.  RDS also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 17 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The settlement is subject to court approval.  On November 2, 2018, the court entered a judgment ordering RDS to comply with the Commission's order to pay S. Sergio Laguna, his father, $37,674.70 in child support, $313.04 in attorney fees, and $10 to $30 in officer-and-director and pensioner bar.  It also ordered RDS not to impose any civil penalties on Sergio, despite the fact that he was an employee when the accident occurred, Raul had been adopted by Maria's second husband, Isidro Delgado, and had been living with her for more than one year prior to his death. The court found that, in a parallel action, the Commission violated Section 15 of the Exchange Act and Rules 15b-20, 16a-1, and 16b-3 thereunder, and that it violated Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Exchange Act, and Rules 17a-3 and 16a/4 thereunder; Rules 17b-11; Rules 13a-13; and Rules 13b-14; Rules 12b-1; Rules 14a-15; Rules 15a-2;"
