  "summary": "On November 1, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against a former Illinois State Trooper who was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that former State Trooper Brian Frank violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that Frank failed to admit the results of his Breathalyzer test because the State failed to lay the proper foundation to admit certain exhibits as business records and (2) regardless of whether the records were properly admitted, they were insufficient to certify the proper functioning of the breathalyzer. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Frank was sentenced to 24 months' court supervision, a $25,000 civil penalty, and a $10,000 officer-and-director bar. The court granted the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered Frank to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, plus prejudgment interest of $2,065, and to pay a civil penalty of $75,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Frank. The SEC also announced related civil injunctions against future violations of the federal securities laws.  On November 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Frank, charging him with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"). The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order freezing the assets of the defendant and his family. The case is being handled by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Chicago Regional Office, and Kelly L. Gibson of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221."
