  "summary": "On January 30, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of three felony child sex trafficking charges and ordered to pay a $15,000 special victims assessment.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in New York, James Johnman, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 368 months of incarceration, a lifetime of supervised release, $1,000 restitution, and a $5,000 Special Victims Assessment, was improperly imposed on a defendant based on his prior convictions.  The court found that, at the time of the sentencing, the definition of a \"convicted\" child sex offender was settled in the federal courts, and the amount of the special assessment was determined by the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Johnman consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 3013 of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $5.000 for each qualifying conviction, $15.00 for each individual conviction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Johnman.  To learn more about the federal criminal laws, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (2014).

The case is being handled by John Rymas and Antonin Scalia and Bryan Garner of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)."
