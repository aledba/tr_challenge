  "summary": "On February 20, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas entered a final judgment against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that the Secretary violated the federal securities laws by entering the Butterfly Center property without consent or warrant.  According to the complaint, the Secretary's waiver was ultra-prepared for the construction of a physical wall along the southern border with Mexico.  In its complaint, NABA alleges that on July 20, the executive director identified a work crew on Center property using heavy equipment to \"cut down trees, mow brush, and widen a private road that runs through the center.\"  The complaint further alleges that in November 2018, the secretary invoked her waiver authority on October 4, 2018, applying it to certain areas within the RGV Sector that include NABA's Butterfly Center.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, prejudgment interest of $2,098.81, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  NABA also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years, and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty in the amount of $20,000, which is equal to the amount that NABA has already paid in disgorge.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Matthew A. Goldstein and supervised by Spencer L. Donahue of the Boston Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Goldstein, Ms. Provost, and Ms. Dugan. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central and Southern Districts of Texas, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office.
