  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against Penny Anthony, a former Marine Corps wife who filed a petition for dissolution of her husband's marriage.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Joseph Anthony and Penny Anthony.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Port Orchard, Washington, on June 19, 1987, Joseph Anthony, then a short-haul truck driver, married Penny Anthony in 1987. The court found that the marriage was mutually beneficial and required that the parties place the parties in roughly equal financial positions for the rest of their lives.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the court did not base the award of maintenance on the actual income of the parties. Rather, it relied on the financial resources of the party seeking maintenance, including separate or community property apportioned to him or her, and the time necessary to acquire sufficient education or training to enable the parties to meet their needs independently.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Joseph.  On June 24, 2015, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of California entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the parties from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of $1,400, not $200,000, in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $750,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains, pay civil penalties, and pay civil injunctive relief. The final judgment also prohibits the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of marriage. The SEC also prohibits defendants from serving as officers or directors of a public company, and from imposing any officer-and-director bar. In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC charged Penny Anthony with violating Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and Rule 15a-3 thereunder. The complaint also charges Joseph with violating the anti-fraud provisions Section 10 of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Section 13(d) and Rule 13d-1 thereunder and with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of"
