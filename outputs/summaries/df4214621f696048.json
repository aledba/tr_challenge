  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California today entered a final judgment against Oracle, Inc. (ORCL) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that Oracle violated its duty to preserve evidence related to Oracle's alleged misconduct in connection with its hardware support business.  According to the complaint, Oracle's failure to preserve documents related to the hardware support businesses resulted in the loss of at least 235 documents.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Hurd failed to preserve relevant documents relating to HPE's and Oracle&rsquo;s unlawful diversion of customers' reasons for canceling or not renewing contracts with Oracle in 2010.

The court also granted HPE the right to request a preliminary injunction against further violations of Rule 37e, ordering it to provide an accounting of the material that was lost in the litigation, as well as an explanation for why it had not produced any documents in its possession.  Finally, the Court granted the request for an expedited hearing on June 15, 2018. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the San Diego Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mark Hurd.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the"
