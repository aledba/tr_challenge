  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Kentucky today announced criminal charges against a Kentucky River Regional Jail inmate.  According to the SEC's complaint, Gary Hill, a recently arrested prisoner, arrived at the jail and was placed in a restraint chair. He asked to make a phone call, but the jailors denied him the right to use the phone. The complaint alleges that Hill then turned on the sink in his cell and let the water overflow onto the floor.  The complaint further alleges that Hickman and Damon Hickman confronted Hill and told him that they would not get away with what he did.  As the complaint alleges, Hill refused to turn off the water and continued to urinate on himself.  Instead, Asher and Hickman allegedly kicked and stomped Hill, who was lying about his prior conduct.  In a parallel action, the U. S.

On the same day, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Hill and ordered him to return to his cell, which he agreed to do based on the evidence presented to the court by the SEC.  Hill also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to a five-year officer- and director-bailout bar, which requires him to provide a copy of the SEC complaint to a jury.  Finally, the SEC has issued an order requiring the court to consider prior-act evidence when determining whether it is reasonable to consider whether a defendant has committed a prior felony or a prior criminal conviction.  It also requires that the court consider whether there is sufficient corroborating evidence to determine whether the defendant committed a pre-judgmentable felony or not.  For example, on the first day of trial, Hill confronted Hickman, telling him that the \"doctor\" was Asher in disguise, donning a jacket, and possibly a wig, and speaking in a foreign accent.  He refused to cooperate with the SEC, and the court ordered Asher to"
