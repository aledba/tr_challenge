  "summary": "On January 27, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered final judgments against Plant Performance Services, L.L.C. and its workers' compensation insurer, CNA, in a case that was investigated by the SEC.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in West Virginia, William Earl Harrison, who was employed as a pipefitter and foreman at Grand Isle Shipyard, told the SEC that he had just returned to Louisiana from West Virginia to undergo job training when he was fired by P2S in August 2013. Harrison also allegedly claimed that he was not working and not doing anything for which he was being paid. The complaint alleges that, in reality, he was working as a foreman and paid by Grand Isle for his work.  The complaint further alleges that Mr. Harrison made false statements or representations regarding his physical ability to work full time, performing any work for wages, and traveling out of state.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Harrison.  On January 13, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking summary judgment, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David Revere and Eric Werner of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Revere, Ms. Werner, and Mr. Werner. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Workers' Compensation, and the Louisiana Secretary of State's Office.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 23:1208 (January 24, 2014).
