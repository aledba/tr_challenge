  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in an international sex trafficking case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Matthew J. Durham, a U. S. citizen, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, in 2003, the United States entered a dormant Commerce Clause provision that prohibits the federal government from regulating interstate commerce, including the sale, purchase, and sale of child pornography.  In addition, the complaint alleges that under the dormant provision, Congress had the power to impose a civil penalty of up to 480 months in prison for engaging in noncommercial sexual activity with a minor.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Mr. Durham consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest.   The final judgment also prohibits the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter or an order suspending or freezing the assets of any company or entity that is associated with the alleged violator of the charged provisions of the federal laws, and orders the company and its affiliated entities to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively, for each of the alleged violations of the proposed civil penalties.  Finally, the court granted the company's request for a temporary restraining order, which is subject to court approval, and ordered the company to comply with the court's order. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Daniel P. Collins and Ms. Wambugu. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the U.N. Secret Service, and the FBI's Office of Inspector General in this matter."
