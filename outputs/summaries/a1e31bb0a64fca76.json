  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania school district for failing to comply with the mandatory provisions of the Public School Code of 1949.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that the Pennsylvania Department of Education (DOL) improperly terminated a Pennsylvania high school math teacher for not performing reasonable due diligence in seeking his reinstatement.  According to the complaint, on or about April 30, 2009, Jones was dismissed from his position as a principal and principal of a Pennsylvania public school district. The complaint alleges that Jones had been employed as a teacher since 2009 and had continuously worked since October 2009. The SEC alleges that, after his dismissal, Jones had a reduced work load at his non-District jobs, and that he failed to adequately mitigate his damages.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Jones, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Jones consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $4,303.00, and requires him to report to work. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 1, 2018, the court granted the District's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered Jones to return to work, and ordered a hearing to determine whether to proceed with disciplinary action against Jones. On June 2, 2016, the Secretary of Education issued an order ordering Jones to be reinstated with back pay. On August 25, 2016 the District filed an application to revoke Jones' reinstatement with the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office. On November 2, the District agreed to a court order requiring it to determine the amount of compensation due to Jones. The court also ordered the District to provide an accounting of Jones' compensation and to provide a copy of the Commission's order. The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Pennsylvania Office of Education and the Division of Education's Office of Inspector General. The investigation was supervised by Scott A. Kasper, Chief of the Education Fraud Task Force, and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
