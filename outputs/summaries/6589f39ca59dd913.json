  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Washington today announced criminal charges against a Bellingham, Washington, company delivery driver for his role in an October 2013 incident in which he suffered a severe hand injury.  According to the SEC's complaint, Michael Landdeck, who primarily worked for Rain for Rent as a delivery driver, was assigned the job of operating a McElroy Pitbull-900 pipe fusion machine.  The complaint alleges that Landdeck had received prior training on using pipe fusion machines but had not performed a fusion job in nearly two years.  In July 2013, Landdeck was helping build a wastewater treatment plant in Bellingham when he was exposed to a potential and foreseeable hazard when he reached into a fusion machine to remove shavings from a pipe.  As alleged in the complaint, the machine had different hydraulic controls, and the operator's manual was not with the company or the industry at large.  Landdeck allegedly failed to check the safety of the fusion machine's hydraulics before reaching into it.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals (Board) has not ruled on whether or not to issue a citation to Landdeck for violating WAC 296-155-040(2).

Further, the complaint alleges the company did not adequately inform its employees of the hazards that could arise from this type of work.  For example, according to the complaint filed in federal district court in Seattle, the company's boiler room was not equipped with a boiler room safety system, and boiler rooms were not equipped to deal with boiler rooms.  Finally, the Complaint alleges that, when Landdeck reached into the boiler room, he inadvertently pressed against a lever that controlled the hydraulic pump, causing him to lose control of the machine and to lose his hand.\u00c2\u00a0 The Complaint further alleges that neither the boiler rooms nor boiler room were equipped with the necessary safety systems to detect and prevent such misconduct.
