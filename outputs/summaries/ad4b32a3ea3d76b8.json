  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Lyft, Inc. (\"Lyft\"), a New York-based ride-hailing company, for failing to provide wheelchair accessible vehicles (WAVs) to disabled individuals.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on December 6, 2017 in federal district court in Manhattan, WDOMI, a Yonkers, New York nonprofit, and its founder, Russell W. Davis, raised the issue of whether the company had standing to offer WAVs in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SEC alleges that, contrary to the representations in the complaint, the defendants did not have standing to show that they had standing.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to adequately represent to the public that they did not provide WAV services because they had no standing to do so.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Davis also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 12b2-2, and 12b3-3 thereunder.  On January 4, 2019, the court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the company's assets, which includes the assets of Davis and Davis, as well as to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, Davis agreed to a settlement where he will be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and will be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the offering of a WAV. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (Feb. 20, 2019).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant the United States Department of Justice's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, which has issued an Investor Alert on the subject of this matter.
