  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a Tustin, Illinois-based real estate investment trust and its owner and landlord for failing to consent to an assignment of a ground lease for a community shopping center.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois, filed on May 4, 2016, the defendants raised the issue of whether to assign the ground lease to ValueRock, Inc., a now-defunct grocery chain in the Northwest. The complaint alleges that, in 2016, when the litigation was ongoing, Larwin and Kimco submitted an amended request for the lease assignment, which the landlord similarly rejected. The SEC alleges that the amended request violated the anti-SLAPP provisions of the federal lease laws, and that the defendants failed to adequately disclose the nature of the violations in their amended request.  In addition, the complaint alleges the defendants violated the antisclosure provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, and Section 10(b) of Exchange Act Rule 10b2-1.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On May 5, 2018, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, entered an emergency consent judgment against them, and entered an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an asset freeze or a civil injunctive relief order.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David Bergstein and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter in the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Bergstein. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
