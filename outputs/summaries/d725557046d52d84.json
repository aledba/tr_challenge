  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Shoreline Foundation, Inc. (\"Shoreline\"), a Florida-based real estate development company, and its former controller, Victor Brisk, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 517.301(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  According to the SEC's complaint, from 2003 to 2008, Brisk was employed by Shoreline as its Controller to develop Hidden Hills, a townhome development in the Bahamas. The complaint alleges that Brisk participated in the development of the project, making contributions toward his share of the profits, and never met with Shoreline's principals.  The complaint further alleges that when performing bookkeeping and accounting duties for the Hidden Hills project Brisk had no real authority to control any of the management or day-to-day operation decisions relating to the project.  Brisk also allegedly did not participate in the project as required by the Securities Act.  In a parallel action, filed in federal district court in Miami, the SEC today announced that it has obtained a judgment against Brisk that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay $219,600 in disgorgement, $219.600 in prejudgment interest, and a $1,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Shoreline and Brisk consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws, ordering Brisk to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million, and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests of $219.,600.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael O'Halloran, John Rymas, and Eric Werner of the Miami Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Florida Office of Inspector General in this matter."
