  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for failing to properly consider the merits of its earlier order granting a Section 7 certificate to a pipeline company.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the Commission from issuing any additional orders or orders related to the pending approval of the pipeline.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, the Commission improperly relied on precedent agreements with foreign shippers as evidence of market demand for a pipeline. The complaint alleges that the Commission failed to adequately consider whether a 14% return on equity (ROE) or 50% equity to debt ratio is appropriate for the Nexus pipeline. In addition, the complaint alleges the Commission did not consider whether the pipeline posed a significant safety risk to the surrounding community. The SEC's order, which was entered into by the Commission on August 25, 2017, required Nexus to design its initial consumer rate for a total of 260,000 dth/day, or approximately 41.6% of its 1.5 million drd/day capacity. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Nexus has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The court granted the Commission's request for an emergency court order against Nexus, which is pending approval by the court.  In its order, the SEC also issued an order denying the Commission\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction, ordering Nexus to comply with the court order, and ordering the company to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The order also prohibits Nexus from associating with any broker, dealer, municipal, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock. The Commission also has a right to revoke an exemption from certain registration provisions of the federal securities laws, such as the right to reapply after five years. The Court also ordered Nexus to pay disgorgement of $2,500, which represents approximately $1.8 million in pre-judgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 6, 2019, the court issued an emergency order against all parties, including the Commission, denying the Petitioners\u2019 requests for a temporary court order and ordering an injunction against future violations of Section"
