  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of a Florida-based clinical social worker charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Wileen Weaver, n/k/a Randall, in her capacity as a Family Services Counselor for the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) failed to adequately assess the risks posed to J.D.D.'s health and well-being by failing to have him tested for HIV while in the DCF's custody.  According to the complaint, Weaver and Riley were \"willfully indifferent\" and \"significantly neglectful\" to the child's care.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against Weaver, Riley, and another DCF employee for their roles in failing to provide timely and accurate information to the court.  On August 27, 2016, the Honorable Margaret S. McCorvey of the U.N. Court for Florida entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants, freezing their assets, and ordering the destruction of any evidence that may have been obtained in connection with the alleged violations of the charged federal statutes and the relevant state statutes and regulations.  Additionally, the court issued an order freezing the assets of the defendants and imposing a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  To settle the case, the SEC has agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations, to a conduct-based injunction, and to an officer-and-director bar prohibiting the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  It has also agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01253 (Aug. 27, 2004).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant a Pennsylvania-based registered representative who has experience working with children with HIV, and a New Jersey-based office that provides social workers with access to confidential information about children with diabetes.  A hearing on the matter is scheduled for May 26, 2018.   The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Ms. Redcay, and Ms. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Health Education and Advocacy."
