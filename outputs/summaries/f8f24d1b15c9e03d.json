  "summary": "On March 16, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of Elaine McReynolds, a former baggage handler at O'Hare International Airport, who is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Ms. McReReynold, who has consented to the entry of the final judgment, ordering her to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  According to the SEC's order, filed in federal court in New York on March 16 and unsealed on June 9, 2017 in Manhattan District Court, the Court found that the Commission improperly assessed the severity of her symptoms and found her unable to perform her duties as a baggage handler.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced parallel criminal charges against her.   The SEC's complaint alleges that, contrary to the Commission's findings, McReyreolds has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since her alleged onset date of April 10, 2010 due to diabetes, depression, sciatica, low back problems, bronchitis, hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, and hypertension.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Commission has agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to conduct a conduct-based examination of all of its employees to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant a determination of whether a person is disabled.  It also orders the Commission to conduct an independent review of its policies and procedures.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 16, 2016).  The Commission's order also prohibits the Commission from imposing any monetary penalty on a person who is deemed to be disabled or has a history of diabetes, and from participating in any type of work that requires a reasonable diligence over the course of a long period of time. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation was conducted by David A. Kasper and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
