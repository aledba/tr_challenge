  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a judgment against a veterinarian malpractice case brought by Karen Quigley, a former competitor of the California-based San Dieguito Equine Group.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Paul McClellan was negligent in performing prepurchase examinations on two performance horses named Syrus and Poncho.  According to the complaint, in January 2006, Poncho began to show signs of a left hind lameness that was interfering with his ability to compete as a hunter jumper.  In a prepurchase examination conducted in August of 2008, the complaint alleges that the horse was suffering from a condition in the cervical facets of his neck that required multiple joint injections.   The complaint further alleges that in performing the prepurchase exam, the horse had a spur in his left hind stifle joint, a kissing spine, and cervical pain. \u00c2\u00a0The complaint further alleged that, in performing this examination, the horses had a long history of medical issues, and that the doctor had failed to adhere to a standard of care that he had developed while training them.\u00c2\u00a0Quigley filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Manhattan, seeking a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of $46,000, prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil penalty of $50,000.  Quigly consented to the entry of the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  She also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to the appointment of a receiver of the company's stock and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  This matter was investigated by Mary Gatti and Candise Pipkin of the San Diego office, and the litigation will be led by Ms. Gatti, Ms. Pipkin, and Mr. Hutton of the New York office."
