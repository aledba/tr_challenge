  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Maine today entered a final judgment against Frye Island, Maine, that permanently enjoins the town from withdrawing from the school district that it previously was a member of.  The court also granted the town's request for a temporary restraining order, which temporarily halted the planned withdrawal.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Portland, Maine on May 20, 2019, Frye island sought to withdraw from Maine School Administrative District 6 (MSAD 6) in 1997. The court found that, in reality, the MSAD 6 district had no statutory right to withdraw and paid its proportional share of costs to the district.  In addition, the court ruled that, based on the nature of the alleged violations, the town could not withdraw from the district without obtaining authorization from the Legislature.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay a penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement plus prejudgment interest. The final judgments also permanently enjoin the Town from future violations of Section 1466 of the federal securities laws, and order the town to seek an injunction against future violations.  On June 26, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert A. Hannan of the U. S. District court for the Eastern District of New York granted the Town's request to restructure its municipal government.  Hannan also agreed to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any municipal property in violation of Section 15 of the Exchange Act.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-20 (1923).
