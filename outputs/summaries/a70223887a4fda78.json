  "summary": "The Ohio Department of Education today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of the Streetsboro Education Association, an Ohio-based teachers' association.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Ohio, alleges that, in 2016, the city of Stow, Ohio, terminated two music teachers for failing to pass a fitness-for-duty evaluation.  According to the complaint, the teachers' complaints alleged that the school board violated the progressive disciplinary procedure, defined in Art. 31 of the Ohio Revised Code, when it terminated a teacher for hazing at a band camp in 2016. The complaint also alleged that, contrary to the district's position, the terminated teacher was not entitled to arbitration because she had \"good and just cause\" to be terminated.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the district terminated a third music teacher for disciplinary or non-disciplinary reasons, including hazing activities occurring at the 2016 band camp.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the district agreed to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (\"Advisers\").  The district also agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the anti-harassment provisions of the federal securities laws, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be imposed by the court upon the district.  Finally, the District Attorney's Office today announced criminal charges against one of the teachers in connection with the alleged hazing. The district attorney's office has issued an\u00c2\u00a0investigation\u00c2\u00a0to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to determine whether to proceed with a court-ordered administrative proceeding against the terminated teachers. The investigation has been conducted by Michael D. Chardon and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U of S Division of Education's Office of Inspector General, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
