  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of drug-trafficking and conspiracy to commit securities fraud.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the Vermont Attorney General's Office improperly obtained an asset freeze and other emergency relief in connection with the alleged scheme.  According to the complaint, the SEC obtained a court order freezing the assets of the defendant and ordering him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Vermont today announced criminal charges against the defendant for his role in a scheme to sell and distribute heroin and other drugs.  On May 9, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Western District of Connecticut granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the asset freeze to be temporarily halted pending the outcome of the criminal case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The court also ordered the defendant to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and ordered him to comply with the court's order freezing assets freeze and any other relief that may be obtained from the forfeiture order.  A hearing on May 10, 2018 was scheduled for 11:30 a.m. EST. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Vermont Department of Justice, and the Vermont State Corporation Commission in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 4233(c).  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, a civil monetary penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Voorheis and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
