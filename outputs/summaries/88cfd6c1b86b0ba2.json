  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Zurich Insurance Company and Taian Insurance Co., Ltd. for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Wisconsin, alleges that Zurich, Taian, and Zurich Insurance violated the federal securities laws by failing to adequately represent the interests of Wisconsin-based insurance companies.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to adequately address the issues raised by the complaint and failed to provide sufficient minimum contacts with Wisconsin residents.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants did not adequately represent to Wisconsin residents that they would be required to defend their insurance policies in a forum where they were insured.    The complaint also alleges that Swiss andTaian violated the anti-fraud provision of the Federal Insurance Rules of 1934, and that Zurich violated the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) of their policies.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Zurich agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Zurich from violating the federal laws, and orders Taian to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Zurich also agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  Taian has agreed to a settlement where it will pay a $20,000 penalty and be barred from the securities industry for five years.  A hearing on the settlement is scheduled for May 5, 2019. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Sherry L. Bendell. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Wisconsin Department of Insurance."
