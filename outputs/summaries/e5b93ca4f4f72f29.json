  "summary": "On June 7, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Persey Tiggs, a resident of a long-term care nursing facility, that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) of 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting Tiggs's application for Medicaid benefits.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, Tiggs was adjudicated mentally incompetent and a guardianship was appointed by the court to determine whether someone was available to assist Mr. Tiggs in accessing his life insurance policy.  The complaint alleges that Tiggs failed to comply with the court's order and that he was not entitled to an attorney-in-fact duty to assist Tiggs with accessing the policy. The complaint further alleges that The Willows, as an authorized representative, was not able to represent Tiggs when the court ruled that the policy was not available to access.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or promotion of any federal program. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt of the Public Finance Abuse Unit and the Ohio Office of Inspector General's Office. The litigation will be led by Andrew J. Birkenheier. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Health and Human Services, and supervised by Lara S. Mehraban. The Commission on Advocacy and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Secretary of Health & Family Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Justice in this matter."
