  "summary": "On May 25, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered summary judgment in favor of Ryan Garton in a civil injunctive action brought by his wife, Linda Garton, and North Shore University HealthSystem d/b/a North Shore HealthSystem Evanston Hospital for alleged violations of the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Confidentiality Act.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on July 23, 2015, Pfeifer issued a subpoena to North Shore to obtain Ryan's mental health records. The subpoena, which was subsequently reissued, allegedly caused Ryan to experience severe anxiety, vomiting, and a long period of distress. The complaint further alleges that the subpoena did not induce Ryan to comply with the subpoena, as required by Section 10(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that North Shore violated Section 15 of the Exchange Act by failing to timely respond to the subpoena. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Section 15, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In its order granting summary judgment, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 15(d), and ordered them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interests. The court also ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 each.  According to the court's order, neither the defendants nor the court agreed to the payment of civil penalties, and the defendants were not required to show cause and effect of any of the alleged injunctions. The order also prohibits the defendants from issuing or receiving subpoenas without first obtaining a court order, and prohibits them from conducting an in-camera examination of the records. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Garton. The SEC also announced related criminal charges.  On May 26, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action against North Shore, alleging that it had obtained a subpoena for Ryan's records and that it issued it without his knowledge or consent. The case was investigated by the Chicago Regional Office, which issued an order requiring the subpoena to be unsealed on May 24, 2019. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois Attorney General's Office in this matter."
