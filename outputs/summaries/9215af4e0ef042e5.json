  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of South Carolina today entered a final judgment in favor of SCMIRF in a civil injunctive action brought by the estate of Bert Reeves.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Charleston, South Carolina, alleges that the SEC violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(d) thereunder of the Exchange Act.  According to the complaint, the SEC's finding that Reeves was entitled to more than $1,000,000 in indemnity coverage under the Coverage Contract was inconsistent with the facts of the case.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in the course and scope of his duties as an officer and director of a public safety agency, Reeves was not entitled to the same amount of indemnity covered under the coverage contract.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Reeves consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 15-78-140 (August 28, 2012).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of S.C. today announced criminal charges against Reeves arising from the same conduct alleged in the Cottageville Action.  On September 25, 2012, the court granted Reeves's motion for summary judgment against the SEC, finding that the settlement does not apply to all claims arising out of or from a breach of contract, and ordering the payment of an additional $1.5 million in civil penalties. The court also granted Reeves a temporary restraining order preventing him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security in the future, including the right to reapply as a member of a municipal government after five years of service.  A hearing scheduled for October 21, 2014, was not conducted by the SEC or the SEC Counsel's Office, and was not supervised by the Chief of the Division of Insurance.  As a result of the court's order, Reeves has agreed to a permanent injunction, to be barred from serving as an attorney, and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty. The settlement, which is pending approval by the court, also provides for the appointment of a receiver for the purpose of recovering"
