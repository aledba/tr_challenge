  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment against the agency that terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights to three children.  The court found that the mother violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its order, the court also ordered the agency to provide reasonable efforts toward reunification of the children with their father.  According to the court\u2018s order, filed on July 27, 2018, the mother sought to show that she was sober, involved in an outpatient program to maintain sobriety, and had obtained stable housing and employment.  However, according to the complaint, the complaint alleges that the court did not consider reasonable efforts to achieve permanency when it entered the termination order.  As a result, the agency was unable to provide any services to the children until a final written termination order was entered by the court on July 1, 2018.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court order, however, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently restrains the agency from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On August 2, the judge granted the mother a temporary restraining order and ordered her to return to the family home.  A hearing on July 24, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The court granted the court's motion to reopen the record and ordered the mother to present additional evidence in support of her termination request.  After the hearing, the juvenile court issued an order suspending the mother from appearing or practicing before the court as a representative of the agency and ordering her to comply with the court orders.   The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Iowa Division of Child and Family Education. \u00c2\u00a0The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, and the Iowa Office of Inspector General."
