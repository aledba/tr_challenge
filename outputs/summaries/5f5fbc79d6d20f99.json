  "summary": "On March 21, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Thomson Reuters Corp. (\"Thomson Reuters\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Thomson Reuters violated the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to provide timely and accurate information to third parties.  According to the complaint, in 2014, the SEC obtained a CLEAR report obtained by the Georgia Department of Public Health, which falsely showed that Kidd had been previously convicted of theft. The SEC alleges that the CLEAR receipt contained false information, and the report led the Department not to hire Kidd as a result of the department's findings.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against the company.  On March 22, 2020, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the United Kingdom District Court in the Southern Division of New Jersey issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the company, and ordering the company to pay a civil penalty of $1,500.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $2,500, prejudgment interest of $100,000, and to pay civil penalties of $500,000.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2019 (Jan. 10, 2013).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant Equifax, Transunion, and Experian, Inc., as relief defendants for purposes unrelated to the reporting provision of the FCRA, and seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-director and penny stock bars against each of them.  An SEC order appointing a receiver to conduct a background check on each of these companies would require the receiver to affirm the accuracy of the information provided by the receiver.  A court hearing on March 21 will determine whether or not to issue an order imposing the receiver's penalty based on the findings of the Commission's investigation.
