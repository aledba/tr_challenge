  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee today entered a final judgment in favor of the widow of a fallen serviceman, finding that, because of his service-connected disability rating of 100%, his former spouse is not entitled to a share of his military retirement.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Montgomery County, Tennessee on December 9, 2002, Gregory Alan Vlach and his wife, Joanna Marie Marie, filed a motion to amend the marital dissolution agreement (MDA) to provide that, in the event of a divorce, the widow would receive a percentage of the retired pay that she received from the United States Army, with no consideration for disability or for an election of VA disability.  The complaint further alleges that the MDA required the widow to waive a portion of retired pay by electing to receive disability benefits.  In addition, the court found that the widow was entitled to the lion's share of her husband's retired pay when, in fact, she had not received any disability benefit from the Department of Veterans Affairs due to her disability status.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $9,230.00, later reduced to $7,384.00 due to payments Wife had received.  On January 7, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the U.N. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta issued a temporary restraining order against the widow, freezing her assets, and ordering her to pay attorney's fees.  Sansone agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $11,230, $1,265, or by $181.00 per month. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. O'Connor and Carol S. Cotter of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mark E. Sullivan and Charles R. Raphun and supervised by Graham Loomis. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The examination that led to the investigation is being conducted by Jennifer C. McKinley of the Fort Worth Regional Office, with assistance from David A. Cohen of the Office of Inspector General."
