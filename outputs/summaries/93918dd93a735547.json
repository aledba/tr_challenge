  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Jose Gustavo Cervantes-Arteaga, a Mexican citizen who was previously convicted of a prior felony for driving while intoxicated.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on November 8, 2019, the court issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the assets of the defendants.  The SEC alleges that, in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") the court found that, as alleged in the complaint, the defendants were entitled to an eight-level enhancement under Section 2L1.2(b)(2) and (b)(3) when they were ordered deported or ordered removed from the United States for the first time.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of $15,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against C.J. Martinez for his role in the alleged scheme.  Martinez has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a five-year officer-and-director bar prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including his right to reapply as a Federal Bureau of Investigation officer in the future.  On December 4, 2018, the federal district court in Laredo, Texas, entered an order permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(3), and ordering him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. The court also ordered him to comply with the court's order barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay an $8,500 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC's investigation was conducted by Eric Werner and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Criminal Court, and the Texas Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement."
