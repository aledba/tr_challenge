  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Ville Platte, Louisiana woman who was injured in an automobile accident.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in New Orleans, Laura M. Anderson was driving her vehicle, a 2004 GMC Envoy, on West Lasalle Street when she was hit by a car.  The complaint alleges that Ms. Anderson, who was in the course and scope of her employment with the State of Louisiana, Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, was the driving passenger in the car and was driving when the accident occurred.  As alleged in the complaint, Anderson was being closely followed in the right lane of travel by Ms. Sanders' vehicle and was able to see her right shoulder, right arm, back and leg.  After the accident, Anderson allegedly began to complain of neck and back pain.  She also alleged she was being followed by a vehicle driven by a cousin who had been injured in the same automobile accident in which she was involved.  In addition, the complaint alleges Anderson was not paying attention to the vehicles when they passed her.  On cross-examination, Anderson agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay $40,167.30 in past medical expenses and $100,000.00 in general damages.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Anderson consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $50,000, which is equal to the amount of her disgorgement and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Inspector General, and the Louisiana Department of Health and Human Services."
