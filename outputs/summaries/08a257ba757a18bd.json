  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against Renatta Phillips Jones, a resident of Monroe, Louisiana, who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court found that Jones had not completed her case plan and changed the goal from reunification to adoption, in accordance with the best interest of the child.  According to the court's order, filed on May 18, 2015, Jones and her husband, Eduardo Montalvo, had been in the custody of the agency for nearly three years when they were charged with drug and alcohol-related violations. The court also found that the parents had completed a great deal of their case plan, including reunification with the child, without admitting or denying the allegations set forth in the SEC's order.  As alleged in the complaint, Jones' husband had been incarcerated at the time of his son's birth due to the violation of a protective order on Jones.  In addition, Jones had been diagnosed with spondylosis, spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease, and bulging discs on sciatic nerves.  On May 24, 2017, the trial court held a hearing on whether to order Jones to consent to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $20,000, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  Jones agreed to the settlement without admitting, denying, or denying SEC's allegations, and to the imposition of a permanent injunction against her from violating the anti-fraud provisions.  She also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency and to a five-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the agency's books, records, or any other security deposit that may be required to facilitate the placement of a child in need of a safe and permanent home.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2017. \u00c2\u00a0    (1)  (2) (3) (4) (5) (A) (B) or (6) (C) (D)\u00c2\u00a0(D) (E) (Securities Release).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Louisiana Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
