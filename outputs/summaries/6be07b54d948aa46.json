  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Idaho today entered a final judgment in favor of the Mexican-American community in a workers' compensation case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Emmett, Idaho, alleges that, in approximately 2000, Mexican immigrant Fernando Marquez was hired by Idaho-based Pierce Painting, Inc. to prepare buildings to be painted. According to the complaint, Marquez received substantial benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act for his injuries, including medical bills, total temporary disability benefits, and permanent partial impairment benefits. The complaint further alleges that Marquez's undocumented immigration status precluded him from receiving permanent disability benefits.  Marquez subsequently filed a workers\u2019 compensation complaint against Pierce Painting and SIF, alleging that the company violated the federal law by failing to pay Marquez\u2019s medical bills and partial impairment in full.  In its final judgment, the court found that the employer and the employee were entitled to permanent disability based on their immigration status, and that the employee was entitled to the full panoply of benefits provided by the employer.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the company and Marquez consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $87,526.64, $30,985.87, and $8,487.60, respectively, to be paid in the form of a permanent disability. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On August 25, 2017, the Commission denied the Commission's request for a preliminary injunction and ordered Marquez to return to the job he had been doing since May 2010, when he sustained an impairment from an industrial accident while preparing a building for completion. The Commission's final judgment against Marquez orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty of $7,500.  Separately, the SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, and the case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Idaho Department of Labor, the State Insurance Fund, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Bureau of Labor and Health Education and the Idaho Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website."
