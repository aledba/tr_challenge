  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of Jackie Lalli, a California resident who was charged with defrauding her father in a wrongful death action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Jackie sought a temporary restraining order preventing her father from violating the federal securities laws, including Section 377 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 377, Jackie failed to obtain a court order declaring paternity during her father\u2019s lifetime.  As alleged in the complaint, Jackie was not entitled to the right to inherit from a decedent, but rather to the status of a person who had no relationship with his or her biological father during his lifetime, and therefore had no standing to sue for his wrongful death.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that Jackie was unable to establish a legitimate relationship with her father during her lifetime, because she had no children of her own.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, Jackie consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating Section 377 and orders her to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Los Angeles District Court granted Jackie and Sansone's requests for an emergency court order halting the partial settlement of the litigation.  To learn more about wrongful death standing, see Civil Action Rule No. 13-20. \u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jackie L. Gibson.  This case is being handled by Scott A. McCluskey, John Rymas, and Eric R. Werner of the San Francisco Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The case is supervised by Jennifer C. Barry, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.  Senior Trial Counsel Robert C. Hannan will lead the litigation in this matter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Secretary of State's Office."
