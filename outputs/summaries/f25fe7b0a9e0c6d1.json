  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil rights case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orange County, California, alleges that Orange County Sheriff's Department Investigator Michele Hill violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Hill agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the defendants' requests for a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay $2.4 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $3.8 million civil penalty.  Hill also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against Hill.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of Florida entered a temporary restraining order against Hill and ordered her to be enjoined from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, including Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The court's order also prohibits Hill from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with a settled civil action, including securities laws violations, and prohibits her from soliciting investment in any securities firm or offering to sell or offer to offer to sell securities in any security firm or in any other jurisdiction. The court also ordered Hill to pay civil penalties in the amount of $5,335, $3,400, and $200,000, respectively, for her conduct in the 2007 search of an Orange County sheriff's department employee's home.   The complaint also alleges that Hill failed to adequately disclose to the trial court that she was not entitled to a penny-per-day attorney's fee based on her receipt of a partial judgment against her in a related administrative proceeding.  Additionally, the court found that Hill violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act by failing to disclose to her counsel that she received a partial settlement in a separate administrative proceeding in which she was also barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Finally, the SEC's order prohibits defendants from making or selling any judgment based on a finding that the court improperly exercised its discretion in denying or denying their request for an attorney-related injunction. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John R. Rymas and Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC"
