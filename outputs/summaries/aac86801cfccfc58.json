  "summary": "On February 25, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment against Volt Lighting Group, LLC, an Oregon-based, commercial-lighting manufacturer (1) who manufactures no lighting in Florida, (2) who maintains no office or employees in Florida and (3) who is not registered to conduct business in Florida under Section 48.193(1)(a)(2), Florida Statutes.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Orlando, Florida, Volt and its founder, Brent Newman, created a website under the domain www.voltlightinggroup.com, which was confusingly similar to Volt's domain, that contained the word \"VOLT.\"  The complaint alleges that Volt and Newman knew that a Florida police officer searched the plaintiffs' luggage and seized $97,000 in cash.  As alleged in the complaint, Volt's website was not only passive, but also non-existent.  The SEC alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties of up to $100,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against Volt, alleging that the company violated the registration provisions of Section 5(b)(5) and (c) thereunder, and ordering the company to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of any civil penalty imposed by the court.  Volt also agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 571 (1st Cir. 2010).  In related proceedings, the SEC and the Florida Division of Securities and Exchange Commission today announced parallel criminal proceedings against Volt and other defendants.  On February 26, 2019 the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Volt for violating the registration provision of Section 50 of the Exchange Act and Rule 50b2-1 thereunder and against Newman for violating Section 50(b).  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael O. McCole and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the SEC Office of Investor Education and Advocacy.   The litigation will be led by"
