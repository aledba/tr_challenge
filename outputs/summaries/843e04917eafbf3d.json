  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment in favor of a Texas woman who was charged with manslaughter for her role in a September 2015 stabbing death.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Austin, Texas, alleges that Kaitlyn R. Appellant, who was arrested for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, used a pocket knife to stab Fatima Barrie, a Texas resident who had been kicked out of the club the previous night.  According to the complaint, the two women confronted each other in the club and began to argue about whether or not to stab each other.  Appellante allegedly told one of the women that she had a knife and that she was going to use it to stab her in the chest.  She also allegedly told the woman that she did not know who stabbed her.  In a parallel action, the court of appeals also issued a temporary restraining order, which temporarily halted the alleged stabbing.  On August 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of the defendants, imposing a $75,000 civil penalty, and appointing a temporary officer-and-director bar.

Additionally, the judge granted discretionary review to determine whether to issue an order appointing a jury based on the facts of the case.  For example, on August 9, 2018 in the United States District Court in Texas, Judge Richard G. Mascianica granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against Appellants' future violations of Section 19.02(b)(1) and (b)(2) and ordering her to pay a $20,000 fine and a $100,000 conduct-based injunction, and ordered her to be barred from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  A hearing on August 13, 2018 was scheduled for 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m., and the jury deliberated for two hours before deciding whether to impose a penalty of 25 years or a $500,000 cash bar. The court granted the motion for discretionary review and ordered a hearing on September 5, 2018.   The Court of"
