  "summary": "On August 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) against them for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges the defendants with violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b2-1 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and ordering the payment of a $50,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced that it would conduct a parallel criminal investigation of the same conduct alleged by the complaint.  According to the complaint, the SEC previously issued an order requiring the defendants to comply with the federal court's order, ordering the SEC to conduct an independent review of the case, which was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Office, with the assistance of the Division of Justice's Office of Criminal Investigations.  On August 4, the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order against the Defendants from further violations of the federal anti-fraud provisions and ordered the SEC and HHS to jointly conduct an examination of the adequacy of the evidence in the case.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018.  Separately, the Court issued an Order suspending the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any federal securities law, including, without limitation, the issuance and purchase of securities in the securities of publicly-traded companies.  It also ordered the companies to pay civil penalties of $150,000 each.
