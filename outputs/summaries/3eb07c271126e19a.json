  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Keely McNulty, an attorney who was charged with defrauding his client, Victoria Newsome.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi on February 9, 2015, alleges that McNulty violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, in 2010, Newsome filed a civil injunctive action against the Bank and Dunn, alleging that they violated Section 75-4A-505 of the Exchange Act and Rule 75b2-1 thereunder, and that they were liable for failing to comply with certain court orders.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2011, the Court appointed McNulty as the conservator for Newsome, despite Newsome's representations to the court that she had no authority to manage and direct payment orders from the conservatorship account.

On the other hand, the court granted the Bank's motion for summary judgment on the merits of the complaint against McNulty and agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The court also granted the bank and Dunn's request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 5 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, and ordered the bank to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount owed to the receiver of the funds in the complaint.  Additionally, the SEC has issued an order requiring the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to a receiver of funds that is subject to approval by the receiver.  This order requires the receiver"
