  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment in favor of the District Attorney's Office's motion to suppress evidence discovered during a stop of a van.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that, while on patrol, Officer Klopfenstein stopped a van because one of its headlights was out, he asked the driver if she could search her backpack. The driver consented to the search. The complaint alleges that the officer asked her if she had a warrant for her arrest, and she consented. The court ruled that, in stopping the van, the officer had no reasonable suspicion that the defendant had committed a traffic or criminal offense, and that he did not have reasonable suspicion for stopping her before she did. The Court also ruled that the stop did not constitute a seizure of the passengers for the purposes of the federal securities laws.  In its judgment, the court held that, as alleged in the complaint, the stop occurred before defendant gave consent to the officer's search of her backpack, and the officer lacked reasonable suspicion at that point.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, the defendant agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the officer to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunction. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Oregon Department of Corrections in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
