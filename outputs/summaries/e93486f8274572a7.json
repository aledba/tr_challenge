  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for Anne Arundel County today entered a final judgment against Nationwide Insurance Group, Inc., a Maryland-based insurance company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 23, 2016, Ms. Shilling was injured as a result of an automobile accident with an underinsured motorist.  The complaint alleges that Nationwide consented to a settlement with the tortfeasor on April 23, 2013, which was the date when the statute of limitations was exhausted.  Nationwide also agreed to pay to the injured person the amount of the settlement offer.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this settlement did not start running until the date of the accident.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Maryland today announced criminal charges against Nationwide.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Woznicki and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit in the Baltimore Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Maryland Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Maryland Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
