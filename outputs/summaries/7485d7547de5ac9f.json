  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against a Colorado Springs school district and its principal in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, alleges that, since 2012, the school district has failed to develop a \"free appropriate public education\" (FAPE) for Nathan M., a child diagnosed with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  According to the complaint, the district failed to adequately evaluate Nathan\u2019s progress in developing his IEP, and instead placed him in a different IEP.  In a parallel action, the Colorado Department of Education today announced that the district has agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Defendants also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as officers or directors of a public school for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17. \u00c2\u00a0On May 19, 2019, the court entered a final judgment against Defendants, ordering Defendants to comply with the Administrative Rules of the Court.  On May 20, 2020, Judge Steven R. Fernandez entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Defendants from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act and orders Defendants to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Judge Fernandez also granted Defendants\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, ordering the District to provide an independent evaluation of Nathan, and ordering the Division of Education to issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the implementation of the IEP and order the issuance of an order requiring the receiver to be present at all IEP meetings.  As a result, Defendants will be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any IEP for a period of five years, regardless of whether or not the receiver is certified by the district.  Additionally, Defendants are prohibited from associating with anyone with a history of disciplinary history, including disciplinary histories, and from practicing or practicing before the court.
