  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Coca-Cola, Inc. and its subsidiary, Odwalla, Inc., for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on March 24, 2017, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, California, the defendants misrepresented to investors that their juice products contained no added sugar.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, similar juice products do not contain added sugar, and that, contrary to these representations, the juice products in question do not have added sugars.  In fact, according to the complaint, many of the Juices in question did not contain any added sugar at all.  As a result, the complaint alleges, defendants could not afford to pay a premium for these Juices because they did not have the added sugar in the juice.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 13(b)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder, and ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against each defendant.  On October 5, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Mascianica entered a judgment against the defendants that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000, $20,000 and $1,500, respectively. The court also granted the defendants' motion for preliminary and permanent injunctions against future violations, and ordered them to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court on October 19, 2018.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Cottrill and Ms. Margiela.
