  "summary": "On April 17, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a nursing assistant who was found to have suffered from severe back and neck pain.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Tanya S. Gibson, a registered nurse and certified nursing assistant, was among the first to be found to be disabled by the SEC.  Gibson allegedly suffered from back pain, neck pain, acid reflux, and high cholesterol, and was unable to walk for more than two hours in an eight-hour workday. Gibson allegedly had surgery performed on her right shoulder in 2014, but that procedure was unsuccessful in remedying her pain. Gibson also allegedly had a long-term relationship with her.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC issued a finding finding that Plaintiff was not disabled, and that she was not entitled to another chance to prove otherwise.   The SEC's order against Gibson, Gibson, and Astrue, which entered final judgments against them, orders Gibson to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. Gibson consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint. Gibson agreed to a permanent injunction, to be followed by a hearing to determine whether to proceed with the application of the proposed injunction, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000. Gibson has agreed to settle the case against him by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty. Gibson is also ordered to pay an $8,500 civil penalty and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. Gibson and Gibson have agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Exchange Act of 1934. Gibson will also be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a registered nursing assistant. Gibson's retirement is pending final approval by the court. Gibson was previously charged with violating Section 15(a)(2) of The Exchange Act. Gibson pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment. Gibson"
