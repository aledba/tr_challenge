  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Arkansas today entered a final judgment against Ryan Bryant, Jr., who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that, on May 22, 2015, the Arkansas Department of Human Services (DHS) filed a petition for ex parte emergency custody and dependency-neglect.  According to the complaint, Bryant, while in the care of his mother, Annette Hughes, was removed from the home of Hughes and placed in the custody of her biological father.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that Mr. Bryant did not know about Hughes selling or using drugs and that he had not been to her home when the children were with her.  In addition, the court found that, based on his past and ongoing credibility issues with the court, he cannot be trusted as a parent.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Bryant consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently restrains his parental rights and orders him to submit to DNA testing, submit to a psychological evaluation, and follow any recommendations for therapy and treatment. The final judgment also orders Bryant to participate in a home study to determine whether the child is suitable for placement with a family member.  On May 30, 2017, the trial court granted the court's request for a temporary restraining order against Bryant and ordered him to return the children to Hughes' home. The court also granted the family-services worker's request to be placed with Hughes despite the fact that the court had previously ordered her to remove the children from her home.   The court's order also prohibits Bryant from participating in the placement of a child with a non-custodial parent, and prohibits him from providing or providing services to the child unless he is deemed fit and appropriate to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction, including the circuit court juvenile division.  Additionally, the Court granted the agency's motion for an expedited hearing on the merits of the case against Bryant, which was conducted in the absence of any evidence to support its findings. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Jessica Warren, Danielle Kimbrough, and John Rymas of the Arkansas Office of Advocacy and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Ms. Warren and Mr. Rymals and supervised by Mr. Walker. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Arkansas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
