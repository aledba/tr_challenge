  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Texas resident David Blake Turner, Jr., who was convicted of two counts of continuous sexual abuse.  The court entered the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the criminal case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Amarillo, Texas, on July 4, 2013, Turner pleaded not guilty to one of the charges and was sentenced to forty-five years in prison.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Turner, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Turner's other violations of Section 17(a) the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17(b)(2) thereunder.  Turner has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, a $25,000 civil penalty, and a $50,000 officer and director bar.  On August 2, 2015, the court entered an order ordering Turner to pay the civil penalty at a later date, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities for a period of at least 30 days.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Fort Worth Regional Office, with assistance from the Office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, and the Criminal Division's Office of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in this matter."
