  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Shanaka J. Fernando, a resident of Dublin, Ohio, who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on March 15, 2016, filed in federal district court in Ohio, Fernando and his wife were jointly property owners of five properties located in Sri Lanka. The complaint alleges that, in addition to the property, the property was appellee's father's property, and that the defendants had jointly owned the property.  The complaint further alleges that the court found that the value of the property in question was based on the fact that the property had been purchased in 2003, using funds from a home equity line on the marital residence.  In addition, the complaint alleges the defendants were jointly entitled to one-half of the equity in the property and a de facto termination of marriage date.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants agreed to the entry of the final judgment that they would retain, free and clear from any claims of marital property, a percentage of their assets, and pay property taxes as determined by the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Fernando consented to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The judgment also prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, from participating in any offering of a penny stock, from purchasing or selling any security of any security, from making any investment decisions other than for his own benefit, and from engaging in any investment in a business venture. The court also ordered that the settlement be subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael R. Weissman and Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Office of Financial Regulation, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
