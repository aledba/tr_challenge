  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Ralph Fox, Jr., a California man who pled guilty to one count of sexually exploiting a minor through the production of child pornography.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Fox, who has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a five-level enhancement.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 12, 2016, Fox told the court that he had engaged in a pattern of prohibited sexual conduct with two minor victims, G.P. and J.P., and had used a grey vibrator to penetrate her vagina. The complaint further alleges that Mr. Fox had not been sexually abused for as long as he claimed, and he had observed him abusing her.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Fox.  On January 24, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, charging Fox with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  To settle the SEC case, Fox consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, and from making any investment in the securities industry. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mandhai and Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Werner and Mr. Werner. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.N. Office of Child and Family Education. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
