  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Copyright Royalty Board against SoundExchange, Inc., a digital audio services company, and its former CEO, George Johnson.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that the Board violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the Board improperly failed to consider the merits of the Board\u2019s finding that, in setting rates for certain services, a reasonable and reasonable standard should be set.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of this conduct, the board failed to adequately consider the impact of the statutory license on the rates paid to independent webcasters in the noninteractive services market.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, however, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Board from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and orders the Board to determine the appropriate rates and terms of reference for those services.  On May 2, 2016, the Court granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the Commission to conduct an independent review of the proposed ratesetting. The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York Office of the Comptroller of the Currency."
