  "summary": "On September 12, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama entered a final judgment against Stephon Lindsay, Jr., a convicted felon, for the murder of his daughter, 21-month-old Maliyah Lindsay, an offense defined as a capital offense by \u00a7 13A-5-40(a)(15), Ala. Code 1975.  The court found that Lindsay committed the murder while he was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, and that Lindsay lacked the capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.  According to the court's order, Lindsay was not insane when he committed the crime, but rather suffered from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the crime.  In addition, Lindsay spent most of his life believing that his mother was his father, only to later learn that he was not his biological father and that his true name was unknown.  As a result of this conduct, Lindsay's mental health was not a sufficient mitigating circumstance for Lindsay to be sentenced to a capital penalty.  Additionally, the court found no statutory mitigating factor in Lindsay's sentencing.    The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, charges Lindsay with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Lindsay consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Attorney General's Office, the Alabama Department of Criminal Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Office of Inspector General."
