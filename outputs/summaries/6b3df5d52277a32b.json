  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against New Mexico Health Care Association/New Mexico Center for Assisted Living, Inc., a nursing home located in Albuquerque, N.M.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Albuquerque on May 13, 2014, Judge David Bruce Nava of Albuquerque, New Mexico, found that the Division of Health Services (DOH) improperly performed and failed to complete a Level I PASARR screening of J.F. Murnahan, a resident of Albuquerque who was diagnosed with spina bifida, a congenital condition of the central nervous system that affects the development of the spinal cord and brain.  The complaint alleges that, in performing the Level I screening, Princeton failed to meet its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that Princeton violated any state or federal preadmission screening requirements.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Princeton consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering it to pay $158,178.25 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico announced criminal charges against Princeton. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, with the assistance of the New Mexico Office of Health Education and Advocacy.
