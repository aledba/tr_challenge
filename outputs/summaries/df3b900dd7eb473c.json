  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a Montgomery County, Ohio-based agency for failing to comply with a court order requiring it to place a child in a planned permanent living arrangement (PPLA) with a public children services agency.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 26, 2017, MCCS was ordered to place its daughter, W.J.S., in a PPLA pursuant to an order issued under R.C. 2151.353(A)(5) where the child was dependent and agency was given temporary custody. The complaint alleges that, while the children's maternal grandmother was watching both children, Mother removed the children from the grandmother's care, broke into Aunt's home, and stole the child's belongings.  The complaint further alleges that the child had been counseled on the permanent living arrangements available to the child and was unwilling to accept or unable to adapt to a permanent placement.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court granted the agency's request for temporary custody of the children.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the mother and father of the child.  On February 23, 2018, the trial court issued an order requiring the court to issue a temporary restraining order and order prohibiting the mother from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The court also ordered the agency to provide a copy of the court's order to the agency that issued the order. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.
