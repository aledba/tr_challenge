  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two companies that are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Barre, New York, alleges that the court improperly relied on the experience-based analyses emphasized in prior cases to determine whether an off-site truck crushing operation complied with the federal rules.  According to the complaint, the court found that NEMG's rock-crushing operation did not cause undue air pollution, and that it was reasonable to conclude that the impact from the crushing operation would not be undue. The court also found that, contrary to the court's finding, the trucking operation did have an adverse effect on the surrounding area.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) entered final judgments against the companies, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the companies to pay civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the anti-dumping and related-party reporting provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgments also order the defendants to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 9A0107-2-EB, May 25, 1999. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are eligible to apply for an investment in a real estate project."
