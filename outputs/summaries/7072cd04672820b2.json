  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty in two separate trials of drug related crimes.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that defendant Anthony Greene was falsely told by his attorney that he had a right to a speedy trial when, in fact, he had not.  According to the complaint, Greene was charged in a 13-count indictment with multiple felony drug-related charges, including possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of hydrocodone, and possession of oxycodone. The complaint alleges that Greene was not charged with those charges because he was on bail at the time of his arrest, and that the State had failed to bring him to trial on those charges in a timely manner.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Maryland today announced criminal charges against Greene arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  Greene has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by agreeing to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 17, 2016, the court granted the motion for a new trial against Greene, which was scheduled to start on July 14, 2016. The court also found that Greene had sustained no actual prejudice in his motion to dismiss.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Greene has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against him. The judgment also prohibits Greene from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock or offering of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of incarceration. The Court also ordered Greene to comply with the bar and pay a penalty of $20,000, which is equal to the amount that he has already paid in restitution.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (March 24, 2016).  The Court granted the request for a temporary restraining order against Greene and a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 13(b)(5) and 13(a)(3) of"
