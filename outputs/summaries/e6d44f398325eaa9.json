  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Brent Braneon, Jr., a Louisiana man who was convicted of second-degree murder in 2008 for his role in an armed robbery and second degree murder of a New Orleans man.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans on March 6, 2016, filed by Mr. Raskin, Jr. and his cousin, Alonzo Gonzales, the SEC alleges that in 2008, Roy Wolfe was in the business of renovating houses, and his wife and cousin were renovating one of the homes when they were robbed at gunpoint.  The complaint alleges that on the day in question, Mr. Wolfe was alone at the house having sent his cousin to obtain supplies that he needed to complete the work.  As alleged in the complaint, the two men entered the house through the back door, stuck the gun to his head, and demanded that he stop talking and take the phone out of his hand.  When confronted by Gonzales and his accomplice, Gonzales replied that he did not have a firearm and that he had an interview with a third person who had been there.  Gonzales agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against Mr. Wessinger and Gonzales.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the SEC, the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, to pay civil penalties of $50,000, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On May 9, 2019, the Honorable Amy C. McKinley granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, ordering the SEC to conduct a parallel criminal investigation, and ordering Gonzales to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of the matter.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of the Chief of the Criminal Investigations, with the assistance of the Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigational Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment in a real estate project.\u00c2\u00a0"
