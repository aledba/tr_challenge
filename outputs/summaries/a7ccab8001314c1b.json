  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against John Michael Custer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Peoria, Illinois, alleges that Custer violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the complaint, Custer was arrested in 2010 and was subsequently sentenced to 41 years and 5 years in prison. The complaint alleges that he failed to establish a substantial violation of his constitutional right to effective assistance by postconviction counsel. Custer subsequently failed to return for sentencing in his 2010 drug case, and was eventually arrested again after two other incidents: (1) an attack on a police officer who was responding to a report that petitioner was assaulting a female in her home and (2) possession of a knife while threatening a man and a woman at a bar. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Custer to comply with the court's order. The SEC also issued an order suspending Custer from appearing or practicing before the court as a trial counsel.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Central District of New York today entered a final judgment against Custer that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities for a period of five years. The final judgment also orders Custer and the other defendants to pay civil penalties of $1,000 each.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws and ordering them to pay, jointly and severally, civil monetary penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Custer has also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The litigation will be led by John Ayres and supervised by Amy Klotz. The case is being supervised by Daniel Wadley and Amy Gwiazda of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Department of Justice."
