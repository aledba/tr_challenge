  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Nevada today entered a final judgment against Dennis Kogod and Gabrielle Cioffi-Kogod in a civil injunctive action.  The court found that Dennis violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay $1,630,292 in alimony and $75,650 in pre-divorce expenses.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Las Vegas, Dennis violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act by failing to disclose that he had been barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Dennis consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating Section 5, and orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a civil penalty.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Dennis, ordering him to comply with the court\u2019s order, and appointing a receiver to determine the amount of alimony to be paid to each of the parties.  As part of the settlement, Dennis agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Exchange Act Rule 5(b)(5) and Rule 5b2-3 thereunder and to pay disgorgement of $2,162,451, representing half the amount he received in the divorce proceedings.  Dennis also agreed to pay an $18,000 civil penalty, which is equal to the amount that he received as a result of the divorce, and to be offset by a $1 million civil penalty and a $2 million pre-judgment interest.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about divorce proceedings, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (1962).
