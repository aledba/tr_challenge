  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia on September 12, 2018 entered a temporary restraining order against Georgia's alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Georgia's Secretary of State, Brian P. Kemp, failed to adequately protect the integrity of the state's electronic voting system.  According to the complaint, from 2002 to 2017, Georgia used Direct Recording Electronic Voting Machines (DREs) for public elections. The complaint alleges that the DREs were designed to record the votes of eligible voters, but were not tested to ensure accuracy and reliability.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, DRE machines are vulnerable to cyberattacks and can be easily accessed by anyone using them.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that, from at least 2002 through 2018, Georgia's Department of State and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) failed to detect or remediate any potential security weaknesses in the voting systems.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the United States federal court, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in the amount of $10,000 and $1,000, respectively, in amounts to $100,000.  Additionally, the court granted the Commission's request for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  On September 19, 2018, the Honorable Rebecca N. Sullivan of the Atlanta Regional Office issued an order requiring Georgia to comply with a federal court order requiring it to implement a secure, secure, and secure voting system for the 2018 midterm elections.  Sullivan and Matarazzo also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 5(b).  The Commission's investigation was conducted by David J. Birkenheier and supervised by Scott A. Thompson. The litigation will be led by Ms. Sullivan and Mr. Ruta. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Georgia Department of Election Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Georgia Office of Inspections and Examinations, including the Atlanta Office of Inspector General.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019)."
