  "summary": "The Kansas Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has obtained a court order suspending the nursing license of a registered professional nurse and suspending him from practicing nursing.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, alleges that Mark Wagner violated the antifraud provisions of Section 335.066 of the Nursing Practice Act of 1940 and Section 536.070(a)(2) of the Kansas Department of Health and Human Services.  According to the complaint, Wagner consented to the suspension without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order.  Wagner also agreed to pay a penalty of six months, followed by three years' probation, subject to terms and conditions.  In a related administrative proceeding, the Missouri Secretary of Health issued a disciplinary order suspending Wagner's nursing license for six months.  On January 21, 2014, Wagner was charged in the District Court of Johnson County, Kansas, by the Kansas Board of Nursing with felony battery. The Board found that Wagner violated those provisions because he was not fit in the role as a nurse and did not have the qualifications, functions, or duties of a licensed nurse. Wagner agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to a three-year probation. The court granted the Board's request for a temporary restraining order against Wagner and ordered him to comply with the Board\u2019s order. The disciplinary order also prohibits Wagner from associating with any third party, including a registered representative, in violation of the federal securities laws, and requires him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against Wagner from practicing as a public health professional. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against Wagner, a conduct-based injunction, and an order requiring him to return to work as a licensed nursing professional.  A hearing is scheduled for May 5, 2015.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 536-070(6).  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Scott A. Birkenheier and Ms. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Office of Inspector General and the Missouri Department of Public Health."
