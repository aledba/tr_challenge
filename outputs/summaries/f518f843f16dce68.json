  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against New York University and three of its dentists for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that in 2005, in violation of Section 349 of the General Business Law (\"GBA\"), NYU misled prospective students by failing to accommodate her anxiety, depression, and anorexia diagnosis during the disciplinary proceedings.  According to the complaint, Meeker, who became plaintiff's group practice director in 2007, forged a patient treatment record and presented multiple patient encounter forms that she knew to be false in order to obtain the Practice Model Values (PMV) credits she needed to graduate from the dental program.  Meeker also allegedly told her that she was \"otherwise qualified\" to graduate because she was supposed to meet graduation requirements but did not do so.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Meeker told Meeker that he knew she was deficient but she thought she did not have to fulfill her PMV requirement.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders Meeker to pay a civil penalty of $2,007, which is equal to the amount of her disgorgement and civil penalty.  Additionally, the court granted the university's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, ordering NYU to suspend Meeker from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and imposing a $1,000,000 civil penalty against Meeker.  Finally, the Court granted the college's request to revoke Meeker's membership in the DDS program, and to appoint a receiver to determine whether to expel her from the program based on the findings of the Commission on Education and the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for February 14, 2011, for which the SEC appreciates the assistance of the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
