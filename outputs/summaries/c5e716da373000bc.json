  "summary": "On March 8, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against General Electric Company (GE) and its various trustees for breach of fiduciary duties in connection with the company's purchase of GE Common Stock Fund units.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York on December 2, 2009, GE and its other trustees violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 5 of the Trust Agreement, GE failed to disclose that it was failing to make meaningful adjustments to its insurance actuarial assumptions, which resulted in inadequate insurance reserves being maintained in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Practices (GAAP), which caused billions in unreported impairment charges for GE.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, GE has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  GE has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million.  In a parallel action, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court against GE, alleging that GE violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and that it is liable for any civil penalty that arises from the conduct of the trustee.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.
