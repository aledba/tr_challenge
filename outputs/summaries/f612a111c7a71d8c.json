  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon in possession of a gun and a bat, ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on March 8, 2018, Cody Dantin, a Louisiana resident, used a cell phone to access his Facebook account and received a message from Ryan Kraemer, the victim of a recent armed robbery. According to the complaint, the defendant held the gun to his head and demanded money from the victim. The complaint alleges that the defendant then began beating and threatening to kill the victim with the gun. The defendant allegedly removed his mask and began to remove his shoes and pants, resulting in Ryan's shoes coming off. The SEC alleges the defendant continued to threaten the victim and attempted to shoot him several times, but the gun failed to fire.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Dantins.  On May 9, 2019, the Honorable Paul G. McCole granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The court's order freezes the assets of the defendants and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, for each of those violations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, C.J. Kerstetter of the New Orleans Regional Office has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The order also prohibits the imposition of a civil penalty of any amount other than a reasonable penalty of $5,000.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2019.  A hearing scheduled for June 21, 2019 will be held to consider the merits of the case.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John R. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley of the Enforcement Division's New Orleans office. The litigation will be led by David A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Louisiana Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Louisiana Department of Criminal Justice."
