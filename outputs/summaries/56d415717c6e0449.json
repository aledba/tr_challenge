  "summary": "On December 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against Michael Bramer, Jr., a New York resident charged with providing false information to a licensed firearms dealer in connection with the attempted acquisition of a firearm. Bramer was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 922(g)(8) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court granted Bramer\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered him to comply with the court order, which requires him to provide a copy of the order to the court. The order also requires that Bramer comply with a court order that prohibits him from harassing, stalking, or threatening [his] child or an intimate partner or child of such partner, or engaging in other conduct that would threaten the physical safety of the partner or partner. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Bramer has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier of the New York Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The case has been supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the United States Secret Service."
