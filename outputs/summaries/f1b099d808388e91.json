  "summary": "On April 25, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered final judgments against two medical providers for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 559.13(11)(c) of the federal workers' compensation law.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, as an injured employee under chapter 440, Florida Statutes (2014), the Workers' Compensation Law (WCL), two medical service providers illegally attempted to collect money from her. According to the complaint, Sheridan Radiology Services of Pinellas, Inc., a subsidiary of Sheridan Healthcare, also provided medical testing in connection with Davis's work injury. The complaint further alleges that Sheridan and Labcorp failed to inform Davis that she was not the party responsible for paying the x-ray fees, and that neither of them had a legitimate business need for the information. In addition, Davis's amended complaint, filed in federal district court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that the WCL precludes her from bringing her claims under the agency's jurisdiction.  In a parallel action, the Florida Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the medical providers.  To resolve the case, the SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint, filed under seal in federal court in Miami, Florida on April 26, 2019 and unsealed yesterday, charges Sheridan, LabCorp, and Commercial Risk Management, Inc. with violations of Section 440.13 (11)(C) and Rule 440.14 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 559-11(1).  The complaint also names Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings as a relief defendant.  On May 24, 2020, the court granted a temporary restraining order against the collection of medical services that Davis did not owe pursuant to the FCCPA. The court granted the relief defendant's request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the W."
