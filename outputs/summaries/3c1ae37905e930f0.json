  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Gregory Anding and Continental Casualty Company, a Baton Rouge, La.-based law firm, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Dr. Currier received an email from the City of East Baton Rouge advising him that the city planned to acquire two lots to improve its existing sewerage facility. According to the complaint, Currier replied that he had recently divorced and was trying to get back on his feet, and that he was willing to spend whatever it took to have his son's residence next door to him. The complaint alleges that the City's offer to acquire the two lots was untimely and perempted. The court also found that Anding was negligent and deficient in his advice regarding the timing of the city's appraisals and/or offer.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Anding. The SEC also announced that it would seek a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $80,312.00. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  On a related administrative proceeding, the SEC charged Anding with fraud in connection with the sale of two lots, and charged him with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933. The defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to permanent injunctions and to the imposition of a $25,000 civil penalty. The settlements are subject to court approval. The litigation will be led by Mr. Anding, Ms. McCreary, and Mr. McCleary. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Inspector General, and the U.N. Office of Economic and Risk Analysis."
