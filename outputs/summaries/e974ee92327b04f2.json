  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California today entered final judgments against Boston Scientific Corporation and Boston Scientific Neuromodulation Corporation (collectively, Boston Scientific) in an action brought by Boston Scientific alleging that Boston Scientific violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, alleges that the defendants failed to adequately disclose that certain of the asserted claims were indefinite.  For example, the complaint alleges that, for example, a spinal cord modulation system for reducing or eliminating pain in a patient requires a means-and-function device that generates a \"paresthesia-free\" therapy signal.  According to the complaint, the claims reciting a \"therapy signal\" are indefinite because the technology does not produce the desired response.  Boston Scientific, for instance, has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by agreeing to a permanent injunction and to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, with the amount of disgorging to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Boston and Boston.  On May 24, 2018, the court granted Boston Scientific a temporary restraining order and ordered Boston Scientific to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Boston and the defendants agreed to permanent injunctions and to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal anti-fraud laws, imposes a $500,000 civil penalty, and bars Boston Scientific from participating in any future penny stock offering or offering promotion.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  Among other things, the defendants have agreed not to participate in penny stock offerings or offer promotional materials for penny stock, and the settlements are pending final approval by a federal court.   The court also agreed to a preliminary injunction, which requires the parties to provide a copy of the final judgment to the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, the United States Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and FINRA."
