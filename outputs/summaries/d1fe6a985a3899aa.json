  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of felony murder in the 2014 death of Jhalil King.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on September 26, 2014, a jury found that defendant Dameino Roberts violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the jury was told that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support Roberts\u2019s convictions because the jury had not had time to actually prepare a defense in the case.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Roberts failed to adequately disclose to the jury that a third person had a role in the murder.  As set forth in the Complaint, Roberts also failed to show that, contrary to his representations at trial, he had a reasonable basis to believe that the third person was involved in the crime.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Roberts has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Roberts, which is subject to court approval, barring him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and ordering him to provide a copy of the complaint to the court for which he has agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations.  On the same day, when two police officers were searching at night for a suspect in an unrelated crime, one officer shined a flashlight on Roberts, who ran into some nearby woods, and the officers chased him and found him hiding in a large drainage pipe.   The complaint further alleges that the trial court violated Rule 404 (b) by failing to adequately consider the credibility of the two eyewitnesses who identified Roberts as the shooter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-8-57 (2014).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced parallel criminal charges against Roberts. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Hightower and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry."
