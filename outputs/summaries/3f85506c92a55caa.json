  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Kyron Theophile, a Louisiana resident who was sentenced to a mandatory life sentence for domestic abuse battery in exchange for a three-year prison term.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Theophile violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that, in violation of Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(3) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), the mandatory minimum sentence for a quadruple felony offender, was imposed on him by the trial court on October 31, 2018. The complaint further alleges that Defendant failed to show that he was entitled to a life sentence when he pled guilty to the same charges he was facing in Section \"F\" and that the court had discretion in determining whether or not to impose a new multiple bill on him.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant had recently been convicted of stealing his girlfriend's car, displayed defiance in refusing to allow his fingerprints to be taken, and was under investigation for smuggling drugs into the jail.  On November 19, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Theophile from violating the federal securities laws and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Theophile consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $25,000, which is equal to the amount of his prison sentence. The final judgment also orders the SEC to issue an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, ordering the receiver to provide the receiver with the receiver's credentials, and imposing a five-year, $30,000 civil penalty. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  A hearing scheduled for October 15, 2018 was postponed for a second day to consider the merits of the case before the court.  According to the complaint filed in the SEC, however, the jury found Theophile liable for violating Section 15:529.1A(3)(b).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against the receiver.  To learn more about these and related criminal charges, see"
