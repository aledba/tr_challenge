  "summary": "On June 9, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a Rochester, New York man for failing to comply with a court order requiring him to provide \"permanent\" medical insurance coverage to his wife.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Rochester, N.Y., on January 4, 2013, the court found that the husband had an almost undeniable claim to attorney fees prior to the marriage and that he was obligated to provide the wife with the same level of coverage as he provided during the marriage.  The complaint further alleges that, contrary to the court's order, the husband continued to pay the wife's medical insurance premiums even after the marriage ended.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the wife was not required to provide this coverage and instead demanded that her husband provide her with the \"same\" coverage.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the wife never called the husband during her divorce, despite repeated requests to do so.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the SEC, the judge has ordered the husband to pay $12,500 as reasonable legal fees, a $5,000 civil penalty, and an attorney to reimburse her for legal fees she has accumulated since 2008.  On June 10, 2018, the Court granted the husband's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $85, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a $25,000 penalty.  To settle the case, the defendant agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to disgorge his allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, pay civil penalties, and pay an officer and director bar.  A hearing for the wife is scheduled for July 17, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 569 (A.D.3d).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General."
