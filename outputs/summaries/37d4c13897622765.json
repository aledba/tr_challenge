  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a third party in a long-running litigation action against Bank of York Mellon, L.P. and certain of its affiliates.  According to the court's order, on January 17, 2019, the Court entered a temporary restraining order against the third party from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  The court also entered an order suspending the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter to BNYM and requiring it to pay $20 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty in the amount of $32.5 million.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Whitebox.  On January 24, 2020, the Honorable Judge Robert M. Brennan granted the SEC's request for an emergency asset freeze and an asset freeze, and ordered the court to determine whether to issue an order temporarily restraining the defendants from further violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court also ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties of $22,200,400, $32,500, and $32 million, respectively, for each of the defendants' fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Whitebox actions.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges Whitebox with violations of Sections 9(a), 10(b), and 13(b)(2)(A), and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer and director bar.  It also seeks a permanent injunction against the destruction of documents and other evidence, and seeks an order appointing a receiver to oversee the collection and processing of any such documents. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the Market Abuse Unit in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and Detection Center in the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
