  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota on May 31, 2017 entered a final judgment in favor of the Trusts, finding that Minnesota's tax authority is not sufficient to tax the trusts as residents.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnesota in 2014, the trustees of four Minnesota-based trusts were not registered as residents and were not required to file Minnesota income tax returns.  The complaint alleges that the trustees had almost no contact with Minnesota during the tax year at issue, and that the trust assets were held in Minnesota.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that one of the trustees was not registered in Minnesota and did not have sufficient contacts with Minnesota to qualify as a resident.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the trustee and his family have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the federal due process provisions of the federal tax laws, ordering the trustee to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and imposing a penny stock tax of $1,000.   The Trusts have also agreed to the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter to the Commissioner of Revenue, which enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the Trust to comply with the provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 588 N.W.2d (2014).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert warning investors to be aware of the potential for fraud when making investment decisions based on information about the status of a person or property in a certain state.  Investors can also check the background of anyone selling investments using the Investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that, contrary to the representations in the Complaint, the Trust's assets and income are not subject to Minnesota income taxes because the grantor's domicile is not located within Minnesota.\u00c2\u00a0 The Complaint also alleges that Minnesota does not have a sufficient basis to impose a tax on the trust's income from all sources, including from Minnesota and from Minnesota, that Minnesota is not a sufficient jurisdiction over the assets of a state-based entity to tax a taxpayer.  This is particularly true of Faribault Foods, Inc. (FFI), a Minnesota corporation owned by Reid MacDonald, who was a Minnesota resident when the trust was created."
