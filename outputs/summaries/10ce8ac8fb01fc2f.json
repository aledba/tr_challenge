  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a group of internet service providers charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 230 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, since at least 2014, Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo! have conspired to \"flood the market\" of online search results with information about so-called \"scam locksmith\" websites.  According to the complaint, the defendants used their market power with respect to online search to extract additional advertising revenue from legitimate locksmith companies like themselves.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that the defendants created hundreds or thousands of unique websites targeting nearly every heavily populated geographic location all around the country, including Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles, in order to extract millions of dollars in revenue.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  To learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 2017).

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the judgment orders Defendants to disgorge their allegedly illegal profits with prejudgment interest in the amounts of $2,500,000 and $1 million, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   The court also granted the defendants the right to reapply as a public company in the future.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge William G. Donnelly of the U. S. District court for the Eastern District of Washington granted the SEC &rsqua;s request for an asset freeze and an injunction against further violations of Sections 230(f)(2) and (3) of the Communications Decency Act.  Donnelly agreed to a judgment ordering him to be permanently enjoined from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and ordered him to pay $1.5 million in restitution, which he will pay in a civil proceeding.  Judge Donnelly also agreed to"
