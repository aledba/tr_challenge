  "summary": "On May 31, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against Jean-Gabriel \"Bivens\" Allen for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an emergency court order to halt Allen's alleged violations of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, Allen, who was incarcerated for Hepatitis C, was not entitled to qualified immunity under Rule 12(b)(5) because he was not permitted to receive the drug he sought.  As alleged in the complaint, Allen was denied the drug Harvoni on the basis of qualified immunity, which requires a court to determine whether a defendant has a serious medical need.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Allen.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges Allen with violations of Section 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, Allen consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $50,000.  Allen has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.  On May 24, 2018, the court granted a request for preliminary injunction against Allen and ordered him to comply with the court order.  At the same time, on May 23, 2016, the federal district court in Brooklyn, N.Y., entered a judgment ordering Allen to pay civil penalties of $75,000, $20,000 and a $25,000 civil penalty, and ordering him to disgorge $3,500 in ill-effects plus interest and pay a $10,500 civil penalty in the form of a $100,000 penalty.  An SEC order appointing pro bono counsel to represent Allen in this matter also temporarily halted Allen from appearing before the SEC before the court as a relief defendant.
