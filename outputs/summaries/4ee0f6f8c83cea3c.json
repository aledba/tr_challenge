  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Mississippi-based insurance company and its co-defendant in a workers' compensation case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on November 25, 2014, Sheree Cleveland filed post-settlement motions with the Mississippi Workers' Compensation Commission (the Commission) in an effort to get the Employer/Carrier to pay two of Cleveland's outstanding medical bills. These bills were incurred, and all parties were aware that they existed prior to the order approving a \u201cFinal Compromise and Settlement\u201d (settlement agreement) and the filing of the Form B-31. The complaint alleges that the Commission knew of and previously agreed to pay Cleveland's medical bills, leading Cleveland to believe they would be paid. The Commission's order, which was entered on June 5, 2018, permanently enjoins the employer/carrier from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay all of the outstanding medical and pharmaceutical bills in a one-year statute-of-limitations period. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Cleveland consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to pay $1,099.99 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and ordering the Commission to pay a civil penalty of $2,049.99. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC also issued an order requiring the employer to pay certain of its outstanding bills, including a pharmacy bill, to be processed within one year of the date of the last payment of compensation. In addition, the Commission has issued a temporary restraining order against Cleveland from further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(5) of The Securities Act. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against violations of Section 15(a)(2) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder and a court order prohibiting the Commission from imposing any such order. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Mississippi Office of Insurance Regulation. The litigation will be led by David A. Basinger and supervised by Amy C. Barry."
