  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a former Chicago Police Department officer who was denied line of duty disability pension benefits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that on April 28, 2014, the Chicago Police Pension Board issued an order denying Daniel Miller's request to be entitled to line-of-duty pension benefits based on multiple traumatic events that he suffered while on duty.  According to the complaint, Miller was injured while riding in an armored vehicle while performing duty as a police officer.  Miller allegedly suffered \"post traumatic stress disorder\" as a result of multiple traumatic incidents that came both from duty and nonduty related activities.  As alleged, Miller's injuries were so severe that he was unable to carry heavy objects like those he would be required to carry in the performance of his duties as a policeman.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services today announced that Miller has been permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization.  On May 2, 2020, the court granted Miller the right to return to duty as an Officer or Director of a Public Health organization and ordered him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, Miller consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The order also prohibits Miller from participating in any type of officer-related disciplinary proceeding, including the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order, and prohibits him from associating with any third party in a disciplinary proceeding.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 24, 2014).  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Miller.   The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
