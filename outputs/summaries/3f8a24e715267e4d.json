  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Kenneth Brewington in a fraud case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Brewington told potential investors that he owned or controlled over $2 billion in assets that didn\u2019t exist.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Mr. Brewington allegedly told investors that the assets he held were fictitious and that he would use their funds to start a new business.  In fact, according to the complaint, the complaint alleges that he did not tell others that he held these assets, but rather that he had received fabricated documents from another individual who had been duped by the same man who had allegedly duped him.  He also allegedly claimed that one of the documents purported to confirm a bank account for 500 million euros, and that the other document purported to be from an unknown bank.  As alleged, however, the court excluded the three emails as hearsay because they were not admitted into evidence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Brewington consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 70 months and a $250,000 civil penalty.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering Brewington to pay disgorgement of $2.2 billion, plus prejudgment interest of $1.3 million, and a civil monetary penalty of $250 million.  Judge McCole also granted the government request for an asset freeze and a bar against Brewington from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 17, 2018).  The case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Office of the United States Secretary of State."
