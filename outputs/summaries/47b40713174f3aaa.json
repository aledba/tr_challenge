  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in contempt of court for failing to pay alimony.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in West Hartford, Connecticut, alleges that William Nappo violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the court granted the defendant's motion for modification of his alimony order and ordered him to pay $1,000 per month in interest and a $2,393,000 penalty. The court also found that the defendant failed to provide a true and accurate copy of his credit report, which was required by the court to determine whether the defendant owed the full amount of alimony due to his failure to pay it.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court improperly sanctioned him for failure to fulfill his obligations to collect the cash collateral held by the bonding company and to pay her $'16,580 in interest.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains the parties' assets and provides for the payment of attorney's fees and travel expenses. The judgment also prohibits the defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer and sale of any security, offer or investment in a company or entity with which he has an interest, and from making any payments to the company or to the individual with which the judgment was issued.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 587, 236, 152 A.3d 1230.
