  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of two counts of murder and one count of aiding and abetting another defendant's criminal conduct.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant, Luis Quintero, and another defendant, Josue Burgos, in order to prevent them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York on November 13, 2015, the defendant claimed that, during jury selection, he received a note from the court informing him that the jury had reached a unanimous verdict on all of the charges, and that he would be excused at the end of the day if the jury did not reach a unanimous decision.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, on the morning of the jury's deliberation, Rodriguez and Burgos confronted the defendant and asked him to hold the gun for them, and he did not respond or indicate whether he had any objection to the court's response.  Instead, the court instructed the defendant to take possession of Rodriguez' cell phone and to call his girlfriend, Nicole Rodrick, who was present during the deliberation.  Rodrick replied, \"I'm just wondering if you have any idea how much pressure you're putting on the jury.\"  The jury deliberated for approximately two hours before it reached a final decision on whether to remove Rodriguez from the jury.  After deliberating for nearly two hours, the jury concluded that Rodriguez was entitled to a fair trial on the basis of his actions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Rodriguez consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Rodriguez also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for an officer-and-director bar, as well as a penny stock bar, and to be barred from associating with any broker dealer, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Connecticut State Attorney General's Office."
