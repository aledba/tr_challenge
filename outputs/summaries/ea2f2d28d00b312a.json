  "summary": "On May 25, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc.'s (FedEx) motion to dismiss her complaint, which alleged that FedEx willfully violated the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACTA) when it printed more than the last five digits of a credit card number on its receipt.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 31, 2017, Duncan alleged that she used her personal Visa credit card and received a receipt that listed the first two and last four digits of her card number.  The complaint alleges that as a result of FedEx's willful noncompliance with FACTA, she and her customers have been burdened with a heightened risk of payment card fraud and identity theft.  In its judgment, the court found that, as with all credit reporting violations, a bare procedural violation of FACTA is not sufficient to qualify a claim under the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, FedEx has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of any civil monetary penalty that would be imposed by the court.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the United States District Court in Chicago issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering FedEx to pay a $1,124,905 civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
