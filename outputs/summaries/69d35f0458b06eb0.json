  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of two counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Jerrell R. Welshhans, a father of both the victim and the victim's sister, made material misrepresentations to the jury in closing arguments to determine whether the two charges arose from the same transaction.  According to the complaint, the defendant, while in the shower, held the victim by the face and pinning her against the wall while her pants were halfway down, began crying and pulling on her hair.  After the jury deliberated for approximately eight minutes, the complaint alleges that the defendant did not respond to the defendant's repeated requests to come back to the house and tell the victim that he had suffered an asthma attack and was going to the hospital.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Welshans.  On March 7, 2015, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the New York District Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Welshlans consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,038,767, which is equal to the amount that he has already paid in restitution to the victims of the same conduct.  Additionally, the court issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering him to surrender his passport and other documents related to the alleged conduct of the defendant.  As a result, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, a civil penalty, and the return of any officer and director of a public company charged with violating the securities laws, including Section 5 of the Commission on Securities and Exchange Commission v. Basinger, et al., No. 13-cv-01, No. 17-cv"
