  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan yesterday entered final judgments against Michigan-based Minnesota Limited, Inc. (MLI) and its former owner, Hans Rees' Sons, Inc., in a case that was investigated by the SEC.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Michigan, charges MLI with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The complaint also alleges that MLI failed to comply with the statutory apportionment formula for MLI, because MLI had failed to demonstrate a substantial margin of error in calculating MLI's fair market value at the time of the sale, when the majority of MLI\u2019s sales had occurred outside of Michigan.  MLI also failed to show any evidence that it had overcome the presumption that the statutory formula accurately represented the amount of income generated by MLI in the state, when in fact it did not.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against MLI.  According to the complaint, MLI and Rees agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Revenue, and the Michigan State Corporation Commission in this matter."
