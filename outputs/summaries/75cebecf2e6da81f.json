  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment in a case involving a juvenile delinquent who was subsequently sentenced to prison for his role in a criminal case.  The court held that a child's right to counsel is neither a formality nor a ritualistic requirement, but rather the essence of justice.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Jackson, Indiana, A.M. had already committed three delinquent acts amounting to Class D felony battery with bodily injury if committed by an adult, and he had already been expelled from school.  As alleged in the court order, however, that defendant had a right to effective assistance of counsel in juvenile delinquency proceedings.  In its final judgment, the court found that the defendant was entitled to a fair and just disposition, and that he had a duty to provide counsel in the appropriate manner.    The Court also found that, as a result of this finding, the defendant could not have received a fundamentally fair hearing resulting in a disposition serving the child's best interests.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the due process provision of the federal securities laws, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  A final judgment against the defendants permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and bars them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock or offering of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of incarceration. The court also ordered the defendant to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer and director bar, and requires the defendant return to the institution of his or her law-abiding adult status. \u00c2\u00a0The court's final judgment also prohibits the defendant from associating with any third-party, including a lawyer who is not a registered representative of a public school, and orders the judge to determine whether the defendant is entitled to the same level of due process and fair treatment as an adult.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 533, 533 (1962).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Indiana Department of Justice."
