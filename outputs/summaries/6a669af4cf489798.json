  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against Karrah Wangler, a former nursing assistant at the University of Mississippi, in favor of a divorce.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that on January 3, 2018, Karrah filed a complaint for divorce on the ground of habitual cruel and inhuman treatment, including spousal domestic abuse.  According to the complaint, Richard was critical of and isolated her from her family and friends.  As alleged in the complaint Karrah allegedly moved to amend her complaint to conform to the standard set by the Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) and \"shall be freely given when justice so requires.\"  The complaint further alleges that after Karrah and Richard moved out of their parent's house, Richard continued to threaten Karrah with physical and verbal abuse and threatened to kill her and her mother.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Karrah's husband, Richard, repeatedly berated her and threatened her with physical harm.  Karrah, who was a registered nurse in the emergency room at the time of the alleged abuse, consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the court also granted Karrah a temporary restraining order and ordered her to return to her nursing position at the hospital where she was recovering from her injuries.   The court's order also prohibits Karrah from associating with any third party who has a history of domestic abuse, and prohibits her from participating in the issuance of a civil injunctive relief. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Georgia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
