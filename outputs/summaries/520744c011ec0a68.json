  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Matthew Marble, a Michigan resident who has suffered from several disabilities, for failing to make reasonable accommodations in response to a request for his child\u2019s placement with a relative.  According to the SEC\u2018s complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, on September 5, 2013, Marble raised a genuine issue of fact as to whether DCS had a duty to accommodate him and failed to do so.  The complaint alleges that Marble requested that DCS place his child with his aunt and uncle, Bobbie and Will DuBoise, who live in Tennessee.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the request came from Marble and was not intended to accommodate his disabilities.  Instead, the complaint alleges, Marble allegedly asked DCS to place the child with an aunt or uncle, and DCS did not respond to the request.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Marble.  On May 4, 2014, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Marble, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and aiding and abetting his violations of the anti-discrimination provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Marble consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.95, plus prejudgment interest of $2,077.95 and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the court granted Marble a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from participating in the development, operation, or promotion of any type of disabled person, and a penny stock bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The SEC is continuing its litigation against Marble and the DuBoises.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Tennessee Department of Human Services in this matter."
