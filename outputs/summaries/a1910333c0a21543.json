  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against defendant Andy Stevens, Jr., who was convicted of felony breaking or entering a place of worship and felony larceny after he stole an audio receiver, microphones and sounds system wires from Manna Baptist Church.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on 8 October 2013, Stevens entered the church on the night of 15 August 2012 and stole the equipment at the end of the service.  The complaint alleges that the church doors were left unlocked after the service, and that defendant took the equipment and carried it away with him.  As alleged in the complaint, however, defendant had not preserved his fatal variance argument at trial due to his failure to move for the dismissal of the charge.  Instead, the complaint alleges, he found a pair of headphones in the baptistry changing area at the back of the church shortly after he left the church.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Stevens, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Stevens\u2019 violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Stevens consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500, and a $100,000 civil penalty.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Amy C. McKinley of the U. S. District Judge's Office issued a temporary restraining order against Stevens and issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the FBI, and the Ohio State Department of Criminal Investigation in this matter."
