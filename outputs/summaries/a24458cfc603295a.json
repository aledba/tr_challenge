  "summary": "On June 7, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against President Donald J. Trump, ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, Arizona, alleges that the President violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the President failed to show that he had a \"personal stake\" in the subject matter of the Exchange Act, and that he did not have the authority to determine whether to accept or reject a proposed foreign emolument without Congress' consent.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in Raines, a majority of the members of Congress who had voted against the exchange of prohibited emoluments had standing to sue the President.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the Court found that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring a case against the President because they had not been authorized to represent their respective Houses of Congress in the case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000, $20,000 and $1,500, respectively, to be offset by the payment of prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Further, the court granted the President's request for a temporary restraining order and an injunction against future violations.  On June 13, 2019, the Honorable Judge Robert A. Currid granted the request for an emergency court order, ordering the court to consider the merits of the case, and ordering the issuance of an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.  Currid also issued an order requiring the receiver to provide a copy of the Commission's complaint to each member of the House of Representatives.   The court's order issued on June 6, 2019:    In its order, Currid and the court agreed to a permanent injunction and to the imposition of a preliminary injunction, which will be followed by a hearing on June 21, 2019. The court also agreed to the appointment of a receiver to ensure that the receiver has the ability to respond to any action that may arise arising from the receiver's receipt of a prohibited foreign emowment. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David D. Humphreys and Eric R. Werner of the Denver Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Rawlings and Mr. Werner."
