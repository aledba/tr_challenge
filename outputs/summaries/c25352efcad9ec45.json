  "summary": "On March 15, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Richard Lee Van Dyke, a registered investment adviser, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, alleges that, from February 2009 through October 2010, Vandyke effected 31 purchase transactions involving the liquidation of previously owned indexed annuities, resulting in over 21 clients losing over $300,000 in commissions.  According to the complaint, as part of his duties as an investment adviser and as a licensed insurance producer, he provided investment advice, financial planning, and recommendations to his clients.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he induced his clients to purchase a new annuity contract that was not in the client's best interests, and that he did not consider the value of benefits available in the new contract when he recommended the purchase of the new annuity.  Van Dykes also allegedly signed suitability confirmation forms for his clients misrepresenting that there would be no surrender penalties of any kind and the rate of the surrender charges would be determined by the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's action, the SEC consented to the entry of an order that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $23,500.  On March 16, the court issued an order permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, ordering him to comply with the court's order, and imposing a $1,000 civil penalty against him.  A hearing scheduled for May 17, 2018, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Chicago Regional Office, under the supervision of John Rymas of the Division of Insurance's Market Abuse Unit.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David Finnigan and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, with assistance from Eric R. Werner of the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Secretary of State's Office, and the Illinois Attorney General's Office in this matter."
