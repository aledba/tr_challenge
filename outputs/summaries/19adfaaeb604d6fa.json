  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of second-degree murder in a domestic violence case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on October 29, 2014, a Lake Charles, Louisiana woman was attacked by her boyfriend while she was in the emergency room. According to the complaint, the victim, later identified as Ms. Hardy, was in a relationship with her boyfriend, Titus Trimm, who had been convicted of domestic abuse and sentenced to thirty years in prison. The complaint further alleges that the victim had told her boyfriend that he had hit her in the head and that he would listen to her case just as she would. The SEC alleges that Mr. Viltz was the aggressor, and the complaint alleges that he was the victim's boyfriend.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Trimm.  On June 8, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his legal fees. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  This case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Joseph G. Sansone, Regional Director of the New Orleans Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment in a real estate development project.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments in real estate by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.
