  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Des Plaines, Illinois, alleges that the defendant, the Vandalia Levee and Drainage District (VLDD), acquired a prescriptive flood easement over an island in the middle of the Kaskaskia River. VLDD's complaint alleges that Keck began to repair the island's nonfunctioning levees, raise the heights of those levees and build new levees. The complaint also alleges that KLC failed to file a counterclaim to the court for a cause of action for the purpose of recovering compensation for the damages caused to the property. The court also found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the pre-clearance provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against KLC, and ordered it to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  KLC also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for May 24, 2018.  On May 26, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Illinois Court of Appeals issued an order granting the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, ordering KLC to comply with a court order appointing a receiver over the property, and ordering the receiver to provide a copy of the easement to the receiver. The receiver will determine the amount of any civil monetary penalties to be imposed upon the receiver at a later date.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, the Chicago Police Department, the FBI, the U."
