  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania-based company and its sole shareholder in connection with a purported fraudulent transfer of real estate assets.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on April 6, 2016, Ivan Jeffery and his company, Acacia Real Estate, Inc., engaged in a fraudulent scheme to steal the estate's assets and then use the proceeds to pay off other creditors.  The complaint alleges that the bankruptcy court improperly held that Acacia and Acacia had the right to acquire the real estate for a profit, and that the court had jurisdiction to determine whether the estate was entitled to any of the allegedly fraudulent claims.  In a parallel action, filed on April 29, 2016 in the United States Bankruptcy Court in Philadelphia, the court held that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The complaint also alleged that the trustee violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").
