  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment finding that Larry Katz violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, Katz, as agent for Best Rentals, entered into a property management agreement with the owner of the Jonquil Street property, Denise Ramos-Laboy. The agreement provided that Katz was permitted to engage in property management services and advertise those services in the name of a licensed real estate broker without a broker's license. The complaint alleges that Katz failed to collect rental payments or management fees from the property through the brokerage he was affiliated with, and that he did not act like a real estate salesperson without a license.  The complaint further alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, that Katz acted like a registered real estate agent without a brokerage license by failing to perform property maintenance services for the property, failing to collect deposits, payments, and/or with the consent of the broker with whom Katz was affiliated, and failing to pay property management fees.  Katz also allegedly failed to maintain a separate property management trust account for funds received by his broker.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Department of Commerce today announced that it has obtained an asset freeze against Katz, which is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Richard T. Kiko Agency, Inc. and Kerry Hile, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Kioffi. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the State Corporation Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
