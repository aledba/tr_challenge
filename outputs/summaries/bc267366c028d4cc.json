  "summary": "On October 7, 2013, the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD) issued a final judgment against OPAC, finding that it failed to comply with the applicable rulemaking procedures.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Oregon, alleges that OPAC violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of OPAC's Rules of Practice.  OPAC was tasked with developing the TSP, and OPAC with the responsibility of drafting and approving the recommendations.  In its final judgment, the court found OPAC liable for violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, OPAC consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions, and orders OPAC to return the recommended amendments to the commission for approval. OPAC also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  On October 8, the SEC filed a complaint in the federal district court in Portland, charging OPAC and the DLCD with violating the reporting provision of Section 206(3). OPAC has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction. The settlement is subject to court approval.  According to the complaint filed in federal court in Multnomah County, Oregon, the Commission has a duty to protect the interests of the people in the affected area. The Commission also has the duty to determine whether OPAC is capable of carrying out its duties and responsibilities under the federal law.  For example, the complaint alleges that the Commission failed to follow the reporting requirements under Section 206 of the Commission's Rule of Advisers, which requires the Commission to report back to the Division of Ocean Resources and Development on its progress in this matter. The complaint also alleges that, in a parallel action, the commission violated the reporting and reporting provisions in Section 206.3 of the OPAC Rules, which require the commission to make recommendations to the department of state agencies on how to proceed with the development of a management plan for the territorial sea. The commission agreed to the permanent injunction, to conduct an independent review of the proposed amendments, and to the appointment of an independent compliance officer. The final judgment also prohibits OPAC from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any product that is not already approved by the Commission. The SEC"
