  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two brothers for defrauding the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of millions of dollars by failing to pay its federal income and Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, Askins & Miller Orthopaedics, a Sarasota, Florida medical practice run by Philip H. Askins and Roland V. Miller, was required under the federal tax laws to withhold income and FICA taxes from its employees and pay its own taxes. The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to comply with the IRS's requests for a preliminary injunction, and the court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The complaint also alleges that, in a parallel action, the IRS filed a civil injunctive action against the Askins brothers, charging them with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $10,000.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court denied the request for an injunction and ordered the defendants to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest and pay a civil penalty of $5,000 each.  As a result of the court's order, as well as other administrative actions, the company has not been able to collect on its obligations, and as a result has not paid its taxes to the IRS since 2010. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Eric Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Florida Office of Inspector General in this matter."
