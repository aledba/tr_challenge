  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Social Security Administration's (SSA) decision to deny Cynthia Brock\u2019s request for review of her medical history and ADHD.  The SEC previously issued an order against the SSA for failing to develop a full and fair record of a failure-to-develop-the-record claim.  According to the SEC, Brock submitted to the Commission medical records from the six months between the hearing and the ALJ's decision that she was unable to perform her work as a peanut inspector. The complaint alleges that the Commission failed to consider the effects of her ADHD at the later steps of the analysis, and instead relied on the opinion of non-treating examiners as justification for rejecting the opinions of the treating physicians.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Health and Human Services (OHS) today announced that it has issued an Order suspending Brock from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an independent due to insufficient evidence to support an administrative decision. The SEC's order also suspended Brock from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any SSA-registered product for a period of at least 12 months after the Commission issued its order suspending Brock. The Commission has agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order, freezing Brock's assets, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  A hearing scheduled for May 26, 2018 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  To learn more about how to spot signs of a medical condition, see http://www.sec.gov/adhd/.  The Commission appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
