  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of three counts of statutory sodomy in the first degree, and one count of child molestation in the second degree.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Adams, who was also convicted of two counts of sodomy.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Callaway, Missouri, Adams was charged in April 2015 with statutory sodomizing an eight-year-old girl while she and her mother were watching \"God of Rings.\"  The complaint alleges that Adams told the victim that he had \"licked\" her genitals while she was lying on Adams's bed while watching the movie.  Adams also allegedly told the woman that he \"kicked her in her bad spot\" while lying on her bed.  As alleged in the complaint, however, Adams did not engage in such conduct, and instead directed the woman to use her hand to \"lick\" Adams's genitals while he was masturbating.  In a parallel action, the Missouri Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Adams arising from the same conduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Adams consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.    The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and Carol S. Cotter of the Chicago Regional Office, with the assistance of the Missouri Department of Justice's Office of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages the public to check the backgrounds of people who commit a crime by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
