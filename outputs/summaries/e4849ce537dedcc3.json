  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against PharMerica Corporation, a nursing home pharmacy that allegedly engaged in swapping in order to secure contracts to supply nursing home services to nursing homes.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, on March 23, 2010, the court found that, based on non-public information, PharMERica violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that the company violated the anti-kickback provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of money it has already paid to settle the case.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the company, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against the company.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
