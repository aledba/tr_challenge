  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against Gregory Lynn Gales, Jr., a Kansas City, Kansas man who was sentenced to prison for burglary in 2001.  The court found that Gales violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its judgment, the court held that, as set forth in the complaint, Gales had a prior felony conviction for burglary that was classified as a person offense when, in effect at the time Gales committed the crime.  Gales also was convicted of a prior burglary conviction in California.  According to the court's order, the sentencing court improperly used the categorical approach in determining whether Gales' prior conviction was a person or nonperson offense when determining whether he was entitled to a fair and just sentence based on his prior conviction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordering Gales to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his prior prison sentence.  On May 22, 2019, the Kansas Supreme Court issued its final judgment in favor of Gales on a motion to revoke his earlier conviction and impose a permanent injunction against Gales from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  It also issued a temporary restraining order, which temporarily halted the pendency of the case.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Attorney General's Office and the Kansas Department of Justice in this matter."
