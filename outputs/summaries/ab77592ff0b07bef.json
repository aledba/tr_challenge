  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia today entered final judgments against two former officers of the Martinsburg Police Department for violating the antifraud provisions of the Police Civil Service Act of 1940.  According to the court's order, on December 10, 2016, Corporal Quenton Burner and Corporal Erin Gibbons sat for competitive examinations for promotions to sergeant and corporal, respectively.  The court found that the Commission's awarding of points for education did not violate the requirements of the federal securities laws.  In its order, the court also found that, contrary to the Commission\u2019s finding, the amount of points awarded to a candidate based on his or her education credentials did not exceed the authority of a municipality and directly conflicts with the purpose of ensuring meritorious promotions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Burner, Gibbons, and the other officers have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 8(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 8b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On February 15, 2017, the Court granted the defendants\u2019 requests for a writ of mandamus and an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, and ordered the receiver to send an email to the receiver with any information concerning the receiver.   The SEC also issued an order suspending the receiver for a period of five years, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and requiring him to provide an accounting of his/her progress in the field of law enforcement.
