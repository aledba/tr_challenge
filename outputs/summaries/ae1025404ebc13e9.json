  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Vin Diesel, One Race Films, Inc., and Revolution Studios for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 10, 2016, Zakk alleged that he was entitled to receive an executive producer credit and a $275,000 executive producing fee for the sequel to xXx: The Chronicles of Riddick.  The complaint also alleged that the defendants entered into an oral agreement in which Zakk was to receive a producer fee and credit for the original movie, and that he had fully performed all of his obligations under the contract.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Zakk failed to show sufficient evidence to support his claims that the contract was barred by the statute of frauds.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, a $75,000 officer-and-director bar, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $100,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office, with the assistance of the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations staff. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
