  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland today announced criminal charges against a Maryland woman accused of orchestrating a series of false and misleading claims about her mental health.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Baltimore, Romechia Simms, a resident of Charles County, Maryland, was convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Simms was falsely told that she was not a danger to herself or others when, in fact, she was a threat to herself, others, and property.  In fact, according to the complaint, Ms. Simms' claims were false.  Simms also alleged that the court improperly issued a hospital warrant for her release, which was inconsistent with the court's finding that she had violated the terms of her conditional release.  As the complaint alleges, however, the court did not deem the hospital warrant reasonable and reasonable.  Instead, the complaint charges Simms with violating the \"capable of repetition\" provisions of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Simms consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains her from violating the charged provisions and orders her to return to her home state of Maryland, where she will reside for a period of five years, subject to a court order requiring her to comply with those provisions.  Additionally, the final judgment requires the court to determine whether to revoke the conditional release of a person who has violated a specific provision of the securities laws, such as the right to a fair and equitable treatment of any person under the law.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 539 (2017).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage people to check the backgrounds of people who commit a serious felony by using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maryland Department of Health, the Department of Justice, and the Maryland Office of Health and Human Services in this matter."
