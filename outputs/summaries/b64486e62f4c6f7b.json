  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Utah and Wyoming Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in an emergency action to halt a planned oil-and-gas development in sage grouse habitat.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the BLM and DNR failed to adequately evaluate the impacts of the 2019 Sage-Grouse Plan Amendments. The complaint alleges that the BLM failed to take a reasonable look at the sage-grouse's impacts on the federal lands and failed to consider reasonable alternatives.  The complaint further alleges that, in addition to failing to take reasonable and reasonable steps, the 2019 Plan Amendments violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Wyoming today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 4, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Donnelly of the U. S. District court for the Central District of California granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an expedited hearing to determine whether to proceed with the litigation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Donnelly consented to the entry of a final judgement that permanently enjoins the Defendants from violating the antiligence provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and orders the Defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. The court also granted the Defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Denver Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Daniel Wadley and supervised by Amy Haak. The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation is being led by Jennifer C. Barry. The Court appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Utah Division of Fish and Wildlife, the Wyoming Division of Game and Fish's Office of Management and Fish and Game, the Idaho Division of Wildlife and the Arizona Division of Health and Human Services Division of Environmental Quality."
