  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Harlan Fair, a registered representative of Infrastructure Repair Service, LLC, a general contractor based in Buffalo, N.Y.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, charges Fair with violating Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and with violating Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Fair consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078, which is equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Fair also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced criminal charges against Fair.  Among other things, Fair has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged violations of Section 5.  On May 2, 2020, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Gottschall of the New York District Court entered a temporary restraining order against Fair and ordered him to return to the district court for a hearing scheduled for June 24, 2020.  Without a court order, Fair will be prohibited from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 206 (1st Dep't 2002), Litigation Bulletin No. 207 (2nd Dep't 2003), Lit. Release No.: (4th Dep't 2004) Lit. Exchange Release No: (3) Sep. 22, 2011, Lit. Delete No:  Lit. Exchange Act No. 208 (2d Dep't 2009).  The court granted the SEC request for a temporary injunction, which prohibits Fair from appearing before the Commission as an independent, from participating or practicing in any SEC proceeding, and from providing any assistance to the Commission in determining whether or not to issue an order imposing a civil injunctive relief.  An SEC order appointing a receiver of the Commission's findings is pending approval by the Commission. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office.   The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms."
