  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas today announced criminal charges against Mary and Lyle, the biological parents of a three-month-old child who was injured in a car seat accident.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Mary, Lyle and their son, Eddie, were the sole caregivers of the injured child when the car seat incident occurred.  According to the complaint, Mary was the primary caregiver for Eddie, and she was the sole caregiver.  As alleged in the complaint filed in federal court in El Paso, Mary claimed to not have any knowledge of the injuries or how they occurred, and that she had never seen Eddie hurt or injured him.  Mary also claimed that she did not know how Eddie had sustained the injuries.  In a parallel action, the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services today announced that it has terminated Mary's parental rights to Eddie.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Mary has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On August 23, 2018, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Mary to return to the hospital.  A hearing on August 24, 2018 was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. EST. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Office of Children and Family Education and Advocacy.
