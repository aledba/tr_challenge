  "summary": "On November 6, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of a Rhode Island resident who is seeking a permanent injunction against the defendants, USAA Federal Savings Bank (USAA) and Charles Baird (Baird), for lack of personal jurisdiction.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Providence, Rhode Island, alleges that, from mid-April 2015 until May 31, 2016, Baird sought plaintiff's help resolving a will dispute in Florida. According to the complaint, after prevailing in the will dispute, Baird transferred $40,000 from USAA's account to his personal checking account at USAA. The complaint further alleges that Baird then transferred the remainder of the money to his credit card accounts directly. The SEC alleges that the funds were paid to five different national credit-card accounts belonging to plaintiff.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Rhode Island today announced criminal charges against Baird.  On November 7, 2018, the Honorable Judge William J. Conrrad of the United Kingdom entered an order granting the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of USAA and Baird, and ordering the SEC to conduct a parallel criminal investigation.

The court also issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the receiver's receivership, which will determine whether the receiver has sufficient personal jurisdiction over the receiver. The receiver has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.00, which is $10,000 less than the amount owed to him by the receiver in the default judgment. In addition, the receiver is required to show cause why he or she should not be subject to the jurisdiction of a federal district court.  To determine whether there is a prima facie case of jurisdiction, the SEC requires the receiver to check the background of a defendant before making a determination.  For example, the complaint alleges that on June 28, 2016 the receiver executed a check from his USAA account to plaintiff in the form of $9,644.33 and that the check was returned and marked \u201cNot Authorized.\u201d  The complaint charges the receiver with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(e) of"
