  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against a public safety professional who was found guilty of misconduct in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that, on May 2, 2016, the Department of Public Safety Standards and Training (DPSST) revoked the officer\u2019s Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced Police Certifications.  According to the complaint, the order was based on a finding that petitioner had engaged in \"dishonesty,\" a form of dishonesty that occurs when a law enforcement officer engages in an act of misconduct, such as lying during an internal affairs interview or in a phone call with his daughter.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, petitioner was dishonest in his response to Hald when he falsely claimed that he could not recollect his conversation with her.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he had called his daughter to ask her about their anniversary, and that he did not remember what she said during the phone call.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $10,000.  Additionally, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of the above-mentioned provisions, and ordered DPSST to conduct a conduct-based examination that will determine whether it is appropriate to revoke the officer's certifications based on the findings of the independent investigation.   The court also issued an order suspending the officer from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an impartial arbiter in a criminal case. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit in the Philadelphia Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Affairs Division, and the Maryland Office of Inspector General in this matter."
