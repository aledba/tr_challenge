  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant's motion to suppress his statements in a custodial interrogation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Homer, Michigan, alleges that, from approximately the beginning of the interview, defendant was questioned by two officers in a marked vehicle. The complaint alleges that defendant was not in custody for purposes of Miranda when he made the statements to the officers, and that he was being questioned in the back of a police car. According to the complaint, the officers asked defendant if he was free to leave the room and when he was told he could leave. The defendant replied that he did not know. The SEC alleges that the officers continued to question defendant about the nature of the questioning, including whether he was \"free to leave\" and whether he had \"used his privilege against self-incrimination.\" The SEC also alleges that one of the officers told defendant that his police dog could \"blow you right off your feet\" if the officer \"sen[ed] him.\" The complaint further alleges that after the officers questioned defendant for approximately an hour and 17 minutes, the defendant was taken from his front lawn to the side of a patrol car and ultimately to a police station where he was questioned and questioned by the officers. The defendants allegedly told the officers that they could \"man up\" if they wanted to, but the officers did not tell the defendant that he could not leave the station without being warned of his freedom of movement. The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlements are subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson under the supervision of Chedly C. Dumornay. The examination that led to the discovery of the alleged misconduct was conducted in the absence of any reasonable person to determine whether a defendant was in custody. The investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley of the Chicago Regional Office."
