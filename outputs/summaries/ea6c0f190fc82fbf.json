  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Arizona today entered final consent judgments against the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Arizona, alleges that on July 7, 1986, ONHIR failed to timely respond to an application by a member of the Navajo and Hopi Tribes for relocation benefits.  According to the complaint, Ms. Kirk was unable to obtain employment records from 1985 because she was too old.  She also failed to tell the agency that she could not find employment records in 1985 because they were \"too old.\"  The complaint further alleges that ONHir's final decision denying her application on December 19, 2005, was \"unsupported by evidence or arbitrary, capricious, or inconsistent with the agency's decisionmaking process.\"  On August 2, 2011, the court granted the IHO's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the agency to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Commission agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the Commission to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the Commission.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Denver Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Ms. Werner."
