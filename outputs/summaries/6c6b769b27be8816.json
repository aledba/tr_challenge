  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Western States parties in a civil action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, Western States and Gas & Oil Technologies, Inc. (Gas & Oil), now known as United Pacific Energy Corporation (UPEC), entered into an agreement to sell and assign a 60 percent working interest in certain oil and gas leases to Tearlach Resources, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tearlsach Resources Limited.  The complaint alleges that the parties entered into the agreement without the knowledge or consent of the Secretary of the Interior, and failed to timely approve the assignment of the 60 percent interest.  In addition, the complaint alleges the defendants failed to disclose to the court that they held a 50 percent interest in the leases, and that they had failed to file a proper transfer of those interests with the court.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and has been supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
