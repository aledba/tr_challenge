  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered final judgments against Spring Lake Ratite Ranch, Inc., d.b.a. Spring Lake Blueberry Farm, and its agent, S&S Packing, Inc. (S&S), in a civil action brought by Spring Lake.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Brooksville, Florida, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 499(c) of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the defendants agreed to pay $109,295.65 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the defendants\u2019 alleged damages.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Spring Lake failed to provide accurate information about the price paid for its blueberries.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, however, that this was not a violation of the contract, and that the parties agreed to use market-based pricing to determine the price of the blueberries that they should have received.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Spring Lake agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the securities laws, imposes a $10,000 civil penalty, and orders S&s to pay a $100,000 penalty.  Spring Lake also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Department of Agriculture, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
