  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (\"WMT\") and its asset protection manager for failing to preserve evidence related to an October 27, 2016 automobile accident.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 9, 2018 in federal court in Detroit, Michigan, Michael Terry and his company, Forest Labs., Inc. (formerly known as CMI Claim Management Inc.), failed to preserve the interior video evidence of the car accident, including the witness statement of Assistant Manager Cassie Doss, the \u201cgarage door\u201d that was pulled down on Plaintiff, and the vendor book.  The SEC alleges that, contrary to the company's representations to the court, Terry did not preserve the exterior video evidence.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he did not see or hear any evidence that the door was defective or malfunctioning.  As alleged in the complaint, the video evidence was not preserved because it was not part of normal maintenance.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Terry consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the judgment imposes a $25,000 civil penalty against Skillman.  On December 11, 2018, the court granted a motion for summary judgment against the defendants and ordered them to produce an exemplar to show that they had complied with the court's order and that the evidence had been preserved.  To learn more about the subject matter of this litigation, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, and No. 17(b)(2)(A).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Terry.  A hearing is scheduled for January 24, 2019, for which Terry will be sentenced in a matter of days.  For further information about the defendants' alleged violations of Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder of the federal securities laws, including, without limitation, the right to a jury trial, a preliminary injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order requiring the defendants to comply with the agreed-upon entry of an order prohibiting them from further violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d)"
