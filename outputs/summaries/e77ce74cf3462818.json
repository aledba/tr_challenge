  "summary": "On February 25, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of a Greenwich, Connecticut man and his wife in a civil injunctive action.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to remove the fence and to restore the surrounding wetlands.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Greenwich, Conn., the defendants had erected a stockade style fence along 103 feet of the boundary between their property and the Zorthians' property.  As alleged in the complaint, the fence was designed to prevent intruders from entering the property and to provide for the enjoyment of the adjacent landowner's property. The court also found that, prior to the fence's erection, Laura Botoff and her husband had raised the issue of \"the absence of any real usefulness\" of the fence, and that the fence impairs the value of adjacent land because it is useless to the defendants.  In its judgment, the court held that, in its finding, the defendants were entitled to an injunction pursuant to Section 52-480 of the Exchange Act, which requires the parties to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $5,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalties of $10,000 each.  On March 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert A. Cohen entered a judgment against the defendants, ordering them to return the property to its original condition, ordering the destruction of any evidence that may have been found to support the defendants' claims, and ordering the defendants liable for civil injunctions.  Cohen also agreed to be enjoined from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, municipal advisor, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Office of Inspector General."
