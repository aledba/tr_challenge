  "summary": "On July 1, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Hayes Beer Distributing Company, Inc. (\"Hayes\"), a beer distribution company, and its owner, James Byrne, in a civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, Hayes and Byrne violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 9 of the Wage Act of 1940 (\"Wage Act\").  The complaint alleges that Hayes violated the wage laws by failing to pay time-and-one-half for stale beer deductions, which are rare and average between 1 to 2% of a driver's gross wages, with an average charge of $15 per case.  Hayes also alleges that Byrne and his employer violated Section 301 of the Wage Act, which requires that employees agree to any wage deduction in writing at the time the deduction is made.  The SEC's order against Hayes, Byrne, and their employer, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Union No. 703 (\"IBU\"), entered into a CBA that expressly prohibits employees from making wage deductions for beer that is not part of the employer's collective bargaining agreement. The CBA also requires employees to contract around the no-deduction provision in the wage act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hayes has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay $64,451.65 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the Illinois Attorney General's Office announced criminal charges against Byrne arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  On July 2, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action, seeking a temporary restraining order, an order freezing the assets of the defendants, and an order appointing an independent receiver to oversee the investigation of the alleged violations of the CBA. In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained an asset freeze against Byrne, ordering him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and to pay a civil penalty of $32,000.  A hearing on July 4, 2018 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5,"
