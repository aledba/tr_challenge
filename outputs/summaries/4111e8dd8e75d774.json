Huffman, a licensed pharmacist, was in contempt of the court for failing to pay spousal support.  According to the court's order, Huffman had been sanctioned for a past pharmacy violation in March, 2015.  The court found that Huffman was not in contempt for paying the support, and that he did not willfully violate the agreed judgment entry.  As alleged in the court order, the court found Huffman in contempt because he failed to pay the support and was unable to find work as a full-time pharmacist.  In a parallel action, on March 22, 2016, the federal district court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania issued a judgment ordering Huffman to pay a civil penalty of $7,542.00, the amount of support in arrearage from January 31, 2017 for Huffman's failure to pay, and imposing a 30-day jail sentence.

The judgment also imposed a $500,000 penalty against Huffman.  A hearing scheduled for June 27, 2017 was not scheduled for that day.  To learn more about contempt, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (January 22, 2017).  The SEC's complaint charges Huffman with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").
