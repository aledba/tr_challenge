  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against a former husband and ex-wife for their alleged roles in a second-degree murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Augustine, Florida, alleges that Michael J. Appellant was the victim's ex-husband and provided her a home in order to live with his son and other ex-wives. The complaint alleges that the victim was a recovering alcoholic who had stopped working due to Alzheimer's disease and was unable to formulate any reasonable explanation for her death. The SEC also alleges that AppELLant was obsessed with the victim, telling the victim that he carried the body to Missouri and buried it in a sleeping bag in the middle of the night thinking she would be fine. The court previously directed that the jury determine whether to proceed with a guilty verdict based on the evidence presented by the court.  In its order granting the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction, the court entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The order also prohibits the defendant and his family from making material misrepresentations about the nature of the death or the motives of the person who committed the crime.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future. The final judgment also orders Appelant to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  Appelland agreed to a $20,000 officer- and director-and -director bar, and to pay $1,000 in disgorgment and prejudgment interests.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be enjoined from associating with any person with whom he has a history of misconduct. The settlement is subject to court approval.  According to the court's order, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, the Florida Department of Criminal Justice, and the Florida State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigational Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment.\u00c2\u00a0"
