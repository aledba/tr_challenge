  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the City of Philadelphia in a civil injunctive action brought by the American Association of University Women.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, alleges that the city violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to adequately consider the issues raised in the complaint.  According to the complaint, the city failed to show sufficient evidence to support its claim that a federal law that prohibits soliciting for a job requires employers to consider whether a prospective employee has a history of employment discrimination.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to the city\u2019s claims, the federal law prohibits employers from requiring an employee to disclose prior wage history in order to determine whether they are qualified to offer a job.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the City consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the city from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $2,500. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of Pennsylvania entered a preliminary injunction against the city and ordered the city to comply with the court order. The court granted the city's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered a conduct-based injunction, and ordered a hearing on May 26, 2018 to determine how to proceed with this matter.
