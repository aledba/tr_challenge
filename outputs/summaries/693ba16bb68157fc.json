  "summary": "On May 11, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Mississippi entered a final judgment against the Presbytery of St. Andrew Presbyterian Church of America, Inc. (\"PCUSA\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, on June 22, 2003, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order, an order appointing an Administrative Commission, and an auditor to determine whether the church had a trust interest in the property of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA).  The complaint alleges that, prior to the merger, the church was not bound by the PCUSA's inclusionary trust amendment and, in 2003, it agreed to be bound by a provision that required the church not to seek or obtain consent or approval of any other entity to buy, sell, or mortgage its property as a church of the church.  In addition, the complaint alleges the church agreed to the appointment of an auditor and auditor to evaluate the church's compliance with the opt-out provision.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Church of God Pentecostal has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the church from violating the trust provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders the church to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David Snellgrove and Carol Hahn of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Robert E. Williford. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Office of Financial Regulation in this matter."
