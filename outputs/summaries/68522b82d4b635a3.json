  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Alaska today announced criminal charges against a Nome, Alaska man accused of defrauding his employer out of millions of dollars in attorney fees.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in late 2015, Bryce Warnke-Green was rendered tetraplegic by a work-related accident. He was treated in Seattle at Harborview Medical Center and remained in that area while continuing to receive medical care. The complaint alleged that the Commission improperly awarded him attorney\u2019s fees based on the fact that he had been awarded a modified van, which he described as a taxicab for wheelchair users, and did not require him to forgo any future non-emergency medical transportation costs. Instead, the complaint alleged, the Commission misappropriated the funds to pay for the van and misused the funds for his personal expenses. The SEC charged the Commission with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders the Commission to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $350.00 per hour. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for the Central District of New York today announced related criminal charges.  On November 27, 201, the Alaska Secretary of State's Office announced that it had issued an emergency action ordering the SEC to conduct an investigation into whether to issue an asset freeze or other emergency relief.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed in federal district court in Anchorage, the agency's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Alaska Office of Inspector General."
