  "summary": "On August 18, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against State Farm Automobile Insurance Company, Inc., a Louisiana-based insurance company, against its former owner and operator, Brandon Forvendel.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that State Farm violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from 2007 through 2013, Mr. ForvENDEL was injured while driving a vehicle he owned and which was insured by State Farm.  After sustaining back injuries in his more recent accident, he sought to recover under his mother's policy, which carried significantly higher policy limits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against the company.  State Farm agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the anti-stacking provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay civil penalties in the amount of $50,000, plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, State Farm consented to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the charged provisions and ordering it to disgorge its ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  It also agreed to pay disgorgement of $2,965, which is equal to the amount that it has already paid to the insurance company in connection with the 2007 accident.  On August 19, 2017, the SEC filed an emergency action in which it obtained a temporary restraining order and obtained an emergency court order halting the issuance of the emergency order and ordering the company to comply with the court's order.  As part of the settlement, the court granted the company's request for an asset freeze and other emergency relief, including an order appointing an independent receiver, to determine whether to issue a civil injunctive relief order against the alleged violators of the above-mentioned provisions.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for September 27, 2016.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17, July 19, 2016 (Securities Act).  The case is being supervised by Chedly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson."
