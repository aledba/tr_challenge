  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Roger Emerick, a self-represented defendant in a civil action brought by the town of Glastonbury, Connecticut.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on February 15, 2011, Emerick was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, from the outset of the trial, the defendant repeatedly interrupted and spoke over the court, causing the court to consider his motion for summary judgment against him.  As alleged in the complaint, the court improperly dismissed the defendant's case on the basis of his refusal to comply with the court's orders.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against Emerick.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000.  Emerick also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney and to be enjoined from future securities law violations.  On May 14, 2015, the federal district court in New Haven, Connecticut, entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Emerick from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount that he will be ordered to pay in the future.  Additionally, the judgment orders Emerick to refrain from making any statements in the presence of the jury, and to not engage in any conduct that constitutes a violation of the charged provision of Section 5(b).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay of the Market Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Office of the Attorney General."
