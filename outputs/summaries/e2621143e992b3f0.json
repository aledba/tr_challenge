  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against James D. Russian, Jr., a convicted felon, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 2015, Mr. Russian requested the court replace him with a new counsel. The court granted his request, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, for a total and complete breakdown in communication between him and his counsel. According to the complaint, however, the court ignored his request for a hearing on June 30, 2017, when he asked to make an entry for the record for the purpose of reflecting his frustration at her refusal to hear his request. The complaint further alleges that at the resentencing hearing, he repeatedly repeated the phrase \"foreign immunity\" throughout the hearing. Finally, he complained about Ms. Brannon not keeping her word after a meeting on May 23, 2017. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced that it had issued a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to participate in a substance abuse program. The judgment also prohibits him from participating in any activities that advocate the violation of the law, including, without limitation, participating in an \"approved program for substance abuse.\" The court also issued an order requiring him to comply with its July 5th order, ordering him to cease and desist from making any statements or requests with respect to the subject matter of the court's order. The SEC also ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted a hearing-by-sentencing system that included an examination of whether a defendant was entitled to a fair and impartial hearing. The hearing was conducted in the absence of any evidence to support the SEC\u2019s findings. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson. The Court will determine the appropriate amount of monetary relief to be provided by the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Office of Inspector General, and the U.N. Office of Criminal Justice."
