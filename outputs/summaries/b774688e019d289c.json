  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Akari Williams, Jr., who has agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Williams opened a package that he believed was suspicious and likely a drug package. Williams allegedly opened the package and found paint cans wrapped in cellophane that contained more than three pounds of methamphetamine. According to the complaint, Williams and his cousin, Kerry John Lirette, immediately confronted the UPS store owner and asked her to \"flush\" the package. The complaint alleges that, when confronted by the store owner, Williams replied, \u201cNo. Flush it.\u201d The complaint charges Williams with violating the federal securities laws and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. Williams also seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any controlled substance.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Williams arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  Williams has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Williams, ordering him to surrender his passport, and barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Inspector General, and the Louisiana State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
