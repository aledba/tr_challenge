  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found incompetent to stand trial for a second-degree murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Sergey Fedoruk, a Ukrainian citizen who was convicted of second degree murder in 2007 and sentenced to prison for a total of 17 years, had a history of psychotic and aggressive behavior, and was likely insane at the time he committed the crimes.  According to the complaint, after being found competent to stand trials, Fedoru began to cry and scream, and the court ordered him to be restrained and placed in restraints. The court also ordered that he undergo a competency evaluation and that he be placed back in restraints at a time when he was \"extremely agitated and not making sense.\"  The court further ordered that the defendant be restrained until the court could determine whether he was competent to proceed with the trial.  On September 29, 2016, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Fedouk to comply with the court's order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced that it filed a parallel criminal action against the defendant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Cyber Unit, with assistance from John Rymas of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Mascianica and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Criminal Investigation Division, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, the Ohio Department of Insurance, the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services, the Kentucky Department of Corrections, the Alabama Department of Revenue, the Georgia Department of Education, the Florida Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Virginia Department of Commerce, the Louisiana Department of Securities and Exchange Commission, the Minnesota Department of Finance, the Maryland Department of Homeland Security, and various state agencies."
