  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a wrongful termination case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chattanooga, Tenn., alleges that, from at least 2009 through at least 2015, a defendant failed to pay child support to a child.  According to the complaint, the defendant, who was incarcerated at the time of the alleged misconduct, failed to provide support to the child during the four months preceding the filing of the termination petition.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Tennessee today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On June 9, 2015, the trial court issued its opinion in favor of the defendant in In re Adoption of A.M.H., finding that the defendant had failed to support the child in the four-month period at issue, that he had the ability to support his child even absent a court order requiring him to do so, and that he was aware for several months of his duty to support and failed to make reasonable payments toward the child's support when the matter was pending a final resolution.  As a result, the court found that Father had the right to terminate the parental rights of his and mother and for adoption, despite the fact that he did not have the obligation to pay support for the child. The court also found that, despite his obligation to support, Father did not pay support during the time he failed to show up to court to establish visitation with the child, despite having had the opportunity to establish that visitation had been established during the relevant period.  Finally, the Court of Appeals held that, based upon the facts of the case, Father's failure to support was not a sufficient basis to justify the termination of parental rights or for adoption.  It also held that Father was aware of the existence of one of the statutory grounds for termination and did not attempt to establish a reasonable visitation schedule when the child was still in the care of his or her mother.   The Court also ruled that, as a result of the foregoing, Father was not entitled to a higher standard of proof in deciding child support cases than he was entitled to under the federal securities laws.  Additionally, it ruled that the defendants' failure to provide child support was a \"reasonable expectation\" that the court would determine the appropriate amount of child support"
