  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a husband and wife who allegedly sought sole parental responsibility of their two minor children.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that Benjamin A. Musgrave, a ten-year-old son of a Florida state senator, and his wife, Lynn M. (Wife), violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the defendants failed to adequately consider the fact that shared parental responsibility was detrimental to the minor children because of the Husband's \"lack of moral fitness.\"  According to the complaint, the defendants were living in separate residences for approximately one year before the court entered the de facto domestic violence injunction against the husband. The SEC alleges that, in the instant case, the wife presented no evidence to support her claims and relied on her own testimony.  In the final judgment, the court held that the husband had no reasonable basis for granting sole parental responsibilities to the wife, and that the wife had no legitimate basis for seeking sole responsibility of the children. The court also held that, based upon the facts presented in the complaint to the court, the husband did not have reasonable basis to grant sole parental duties to the Wife.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 1, 2018, the trial court issued its final judgment in favor of the divorce of the wife. The final judgment also orders the husband to name the wife as a beneficiary of his existing life insurance policy, and requires the wife to name her beneficiary as required by the court's order. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  A hearing on May 2, 2018 was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. Eastern.  According the SEC complaint, a jury deliberated on the merits of the case for two days before issuing its final judgments on May 1 and May 2. The jury found the defendants liable for violations of the anti-fraud provisions under Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties of $15,000 each. The trial court also ordered the husband not to participate in any extracurricular activities and to sign the wife's final judgment"
