  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against BVVG, a German state-owned corporation, for violating the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1940.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Mady Marieluise Schubarth, a California resident, sought to have the estate expropriated from her family at the end of World War II. The complaint alleges that the estate was located in the German Democratic Republic (\u201cEast Germany\u201d), a satellite state of the Soviet Union divided from the then-Federal Republic of Germany.  The complaint further alleges that Schubart sought to convince the court that the Estate was located abroad and that, in the early 1990s, the Trust Agency was engaged in \"commercial activity\" in the United States after it succeeded to the trust agency\u2019s responsibilities.  As alleged in the complaint, the Estate is located in Germany, and the trustee agency that allegedly markets and manages the estate is located abroad.  In 2014, the court held that Germany had not waived its sovereign immunity when enacting the FCN Treaty, and that BVB continued to market and sell the Estate even after closing its New York office in 1994.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, BVB consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $3.5 billion, prejudgment interest of $1.8 million, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Schubar has also agreed to a settlement where she will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David A. Price and Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Office of International Affairs and the Division of Justice's Office of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Price, Ms. Werner, and Mr. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, the U.K. Secret Service, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, as well as the Swiss Ministry of Justice."
