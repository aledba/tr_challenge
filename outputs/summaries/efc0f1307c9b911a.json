  "summary": "On March 16, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of a motion to extend the time to serve a defendant.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, on December 17, 2009, Jean Joseph Saintus commenced this action to foreclose a residential mortgage on his property. The complaint alleges that the defendant, having agreed to a judgment granting him a six-year extension of the time for service, requested the extension because he was well-aware that a foreclosure action was pending. The court granted the defendant's request for an extension of time, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and ordered the defendant to comply with the court's order. The SEC's order, which was entered on the same day, denied the plaintiff's motion for an additional six-month extension. The Court also issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of an emergency action.  The court also denied the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order.  In a parallel action, the United States Bankruptcy Commission announced that it was appointing a receiver to oversee the foreclosure of the property located on the property.  On January 22, 2016, the court issued a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in the amount of $10,000, and a $1,000 officer-and-director bar against the defendants.  To learn more about expedited service, see Litigation Release No. 10-cv-8221 (January 22, 2017).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U-S Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.-S. Attorney's Department of Justice in this matter.  For further information, see the SEC Complaint Bulletin No. 13-20-2017."
