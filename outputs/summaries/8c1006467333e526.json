  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment in favor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York filed an emergency action to halt the payment of workers' compensation benefits to a Tennessee-based trucking company.  In its order, the SEC alleges that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 97-2(a) of the North Carolina Workers' Compensation Act and Rule 97-4(b) thereunder.  According to the SEC's order, defendants failed to disclose to the Commission that they were entitled to reimbursement for the cost of attendant care provided to plaintiff's wife.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $5,000, which is equal to disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $100,000 civil penalty.  On August 2, 2016, the U-S District Court in Charlotte entered a judgment against the defendants, finding that the defendants violated Section 97 of the Commission's order and ordering them to disgorge their gains of $463.30 per week and pay $8,406,832.00 for treatment of the injuries plaintiff suffered in the accident, pursuant to the company's obligation to pay the entire cost of the attendant care that plaintiff received in the event of a worker's compensation claim.  Additionally, the court found that defendants had no reasonable basis to justify not paying the additional part of the per diem allowance to plaintiff, and that the company was entitled to a \"credit\" against the amount of the compensation owed to the injured worker.  Finally, the Court found that the complaint was not entitled to relief based on the facts of the matter, and ordered the defendants to pay an additional $400 per month toward the costs of the plaintiff's apartment.  As a result of this finding, the complaint has not been named as a defendant in the case, and the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations.   In a parallel action, the United Kingdom Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the three defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson."
