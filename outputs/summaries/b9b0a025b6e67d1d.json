  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of a California-based pension plan that permanently enjoins certain spouses from participating in the provision of spousal continuance benefits.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, California, Richard Irvin and his wife Marianne Irvin obtained a judgment of legal separation in October 2013, which permanently enjoined them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 31760 of the federal securities laws.  The court also found that, contrary to the stated intent of the Legislature, the judgment expressly excluded a legally separated spouse from the right to receive continuance benefit.  In addition, the court found that a spouse who is not a \"surviving spouse\" is not entitled to the same type of pension benefits as a surviving spouse.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Richard and Marianne consented to the entry of the final judgment, which, in its entirety, prohibited them from acting as unregistered brokers or brokers in the pension plan.  As a result of the court\u2019s order, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 31760.2, Litigation Bulletin No. 13-20-2017.  This case is being handled by John Rymas of the San Diego Regional Office, under the supervision of Marc Blau of the Office of Advocacy and Advocacy. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
