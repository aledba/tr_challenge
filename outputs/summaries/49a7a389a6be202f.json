  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Dunbar Homes, Inc., a land developer and residential builder based in Franklin Township, N.J., that permanently enjoins Dunbar from violating the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, Dunbar's application for site plan approval and a \"conditional use special reasons\" (TOA) variance was not complete. The complaint alleges that the Township Board of Adjustment (Board) improperly determined that the TOA Rule applied only upon submission of an application for development and did not require a \"completeness review\" of the application.  The complaint further alleges that Dunbar failed to include in its application a list of requirements for a site plan or variance, and failed to submit a complete application for that purpose.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Department of Commerce today announced that it would require Dunbar to apply for a \"special reasons\" exemption from the mandatory prerogative writs that govern municipal land use decisions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Board agreed with the Board's decision and agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the New York Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Office of Planning and Inspections. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Secretary of State's Office, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-20:8 (2014).  The litigation will be led by Norman Singer and J.D. Shambie Singer and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The case is being supervised by Chedly C.

The order requires that the application be completed within five business days after the deadline for submission of the final decision.
