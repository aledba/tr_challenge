  "summary": "On May 31, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Smitty's Supply/Big 4 Trucking, Inc., a New Orleans-based trucking company, for making materially false statements in connection with the company's receipt of workers' compensation benefits.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, Mississippi, from April 5, 2017 through April 12, 2018, defendant, who was injured while making a delivery to an auto parts store in Gretna, Louisiana, claimed that he experienced chest pains and a sharp pain in his chest, arm, and leg when he attempted to insert a manual pallet jack underneath the pallet.  The complaint alleges that, in attempting to insert the manual jack, claimant felt the pain run down the back of his neck and arms, and that he \"thought [he] was having a heart attack\" when he came to the hospital.  As alleged in the complaint, however, that claimant did not report the pain to his medical providers and did not receive any medical treatment for it.  In addition, the SEC alleges that defendant made false statements regarding his prior experience of chest pains, his prior experiencing of anxiety attacks, and his previous experience of leg pain due to RA.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Hines and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Mississippi, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
