  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama today entered a final judgment against defendant Alfredo Collier, Jr., who was previously convicted of criminally negligent homicide.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that Collier violated the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 15b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Collier agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and agreed to a permanent injunction, to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, and to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Collier also agreed to be prohibited from associating with any person who has been convicted of a felony or a Class B felony.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Collier.  On May 17, 2018, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals issued a temporary restraining order, freezing Collier's assets, and ordering him to pay an $8,500 civil penalty, a $2,500 officer-and-director bar, and a $10,000 officer- and director-admit-of-fund-raising bar.  A hearing for Collier was scheduled for June 21, 2018.
