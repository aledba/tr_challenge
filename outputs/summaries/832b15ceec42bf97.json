  "summary": "On October 7, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the defendants for violating the common-law provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, the defendants claimed, among other things, that they had a vested right under the common law to develop Madison Green under the R\u20133 zoning regulations.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the plaintiffs' property was within the Town of Newburgh's R-3 zoning district, which permits multi-family housing.  In addition, the complaint alleges, as alleged, that the defendants had not satisfied all the conditions in the resolution, they were not entitled to the issuance of a building permit under the new zoning regulations, and thus, did not have the right to develop the property under the old zoning regulations when, in fact, they had not developed Madison Green at all.  As a result of the defendants' actions, the ZBA issued an order requiring the defendants to pay $358,999.73 in engineering and review costs, and the defendants agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of an order and judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the Defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the State Corporation Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Commodities Futures Trading Commission (FINRA) in this matter."
