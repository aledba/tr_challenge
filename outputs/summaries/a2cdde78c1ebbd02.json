  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against a jury that found Dawn Manning liable for her pain and suffering resulting from a 2015 automobile accident.  The jury deliberated for about 45 minutes before finding Manning liable.  According to the SEC's complaint, on October 24, 2014, Manning was stopped at a stop sign preparing to turn right out of her apartment complex onto Georgetown Road in Indianapolis. According to a complaint filed in federal court in Indianapolis, Manning suffered severe neck and back pain and was unable to participate in regular life activities. The SEC alleges that the jury found that Manning had no permanent injuries and was not on probation at the time of the accident. The complaint further alleges that after the accident, Manning became moody, depressed, and had a significant amount of weight gained due to her inability to work out and her mood swings. The jury found Manning liable based on the jury's finding that she had suffered significant injuries and that she was a \"malingerer.\" The SEC also found that, contrary to its findings, the jury was improperly instructed not to remove Manning from the jury because she was \"in pain\" and unable to move her vehicle out of the way. The court also ruled that Manning was entitled to a new trial based on her \"probable harm\" standard, which requires a jury to determine whether a defendant has a reasonable chance of recovering from a serious injury.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Manning.  On November 2, 2017, the trial court issued an order summarily denying a motion to correct error in the case filed by the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins Manning from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay $1.3 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Nov. 2, 2018).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
