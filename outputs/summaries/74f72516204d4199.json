  "summary": "On October 9, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Valerie Flores, a Wisconsin resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal supervised release provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Flores, ordering her to comply with the court order.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Flores waived her right to a fair and genuine opportunity to raise objections to the supervised release conditions.  As alleged in the complaint, however, she did not waive the right to an attorney or to present an attorney-client relationship with the defendant.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Flores failed to disclose to the court that she had signed a waiver that she would not challenge the conditions of her supervised release.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Flores consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of 10 years and a $10,000 officer-and-director bar, and requires her to show cause and effect in writing before sentencing.  On October 13, 2019, the court granted Flores a preliminary injunction against future violations of the supervised releases provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New York today announced criminal charges against Flores arising from the same conduct violations.  Among other things, the SEC previously charged Flores with violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 206(3) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and ordered her to repay the amount of her ill-gotten gains with interest in a civil monetary penalty of $1.8 million.  To settle the SEC case, Flores agreed to a permanent injunction, to be followed by an order appointing a receiver, and to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in her case.  She also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer and director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay civil penalties of $2.5 million, $1 million, and $100,000, respectively.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see United States v. Smith, 906 F.3d 645, 571 (7th Cir. 2009).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice in this matter."
