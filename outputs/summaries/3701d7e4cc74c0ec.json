  "summary": "On December 24, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of South Carolina entered a final judgment against Christopher Wilson, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for orchestrating a multi-million dollar bank fraud.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbia, South Carolina, alleges that Wilson was the only person present at the time of the alleged scheme.  According to the complaint, Wilson was one of two individuals who were arrested and charged with the scheme. The SEC alleges that, while Wilson was in the process of being released from prison, two men entered Wilson's house and demanded a ride. The complaint further alleges that the two men shot Wilson as he lay on the ground, and Wilson was shot by one of the robbers.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for South Carolina today announced criminal charges against Wilson.  Wilson has pleaded guilty to one count of criminal conspiracy, burglary second degree, and five counts of attempted murder. The court also ordered Wilson to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On December 31, 2016, the SEC filed an emergency action against Wilson, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Wilson has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $2,500 in restitution.  He has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.  To settle the case, the court will determine the amount of monetary relief to be provided by the court.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (Dec. 24, 2016).  The Court's order also prohibits Wilson from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any electronic device or data, including the right to reapply after five years in prison.  A hearing scheduled for today is scheduled for Jan. 26, 2019.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and the case is being supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley."
