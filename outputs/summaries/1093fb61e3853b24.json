  "summary": "On August 15, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment granting the Village of Briarcliff, Texas' request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Austin, Texas, alleges that, in 2002, James and Linda Clendenin, then the Village's owners, unlawfully entered into a contract with the Village that granted them a prescriptive easement across the property to install and maintain a raw water line along a preexisting line. The contract also granted the Village the right to use the property for its own purposes. The complaint alleges that the Village violated the contract by failing to convey Lot 268A subject to Triple BB\u2019s license, and that it therefore took the Village property without compensation.  According to the complaint, the Village also failed to establish a waiver of its governmental immunity when it sought to display the billboard on the property.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the Village for its violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, civil penalties, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and an officer-and-director bar.  To settle the SEC's charges, Triple BB has agreed to settle the case against it by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the District Court granted Triple BB's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered the Village to comply with the court order, and ordered it to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court.  On August 21, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Triple BB, seeking a temporary asset freeze, an injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the Texas Securities Act, and a penny stock bar. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson."
