  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama today entered a final judgment against the City of Decatur and its current councilmembers in an ongoing civil rights case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that, in 2010, Decatur residents passed a referendum to change the form of government of the city.  According to the complaint, the city's then-mayor, a majority-black mayor, and five city councilmembers elected from single-member voting districts did not meet the preclearance requirements required under the federal Voting Rights Act of 1940. The complaint further alleges that the city failed to comply with those requirements and, instead of providing the city with additional information, the City withdrew the council-manager districting plan and created a new plan (redrawn to accommodate the 2010 census) under the original government structure with five single members elected from the same voting-age majority.  In 2014, the court issued a temporary restraining order halting the City's implementation of the new plan.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in the District of Columbia entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the city from violating the federal securities laws and orders the city to implement the proposed changes. The court's order also prohibits the City from issuing a civil injunctive order, imposing a $25,000 civil penalty, and ordering the City to pay a $75,000 penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for May 26, 2018. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Department of Justice in this matter."
