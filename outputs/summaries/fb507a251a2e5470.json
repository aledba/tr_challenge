  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a former University of California employee who was terminated for acting as an unregistered representative of the university.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that on July 8, 2009, Richard A. Do, a medical doctor who had been terminated from the university for repeatedly refusing to follow instructions from his superior to modify his approach to patient records retrieval, was confronted by Do and told to get out of his chair.  According to the complaint, Do replied, \"So I wouldn't deck him.\"  The complaint further alleges that Do replied that he did not remember using the term \"deck you\" at the time, and did not think he would have used it.  In a parallel action, the California Department of Education today announced that Do had been placed on administrative leave because he had threatened to \"deck\" his supervisor during a disciplinary hearing.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Do has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Do to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Do has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public university and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000.  To settle the case, Do agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay an $8,500 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On November 17, 2010, the court granted Do's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered Do to return to the university, and ordered him to comply with the university's requests for a hearing officer to determine whether he was entitled to an independent judgment based on the facts and circumstances of the case. The court also granted Do the right to reapply after five years of being barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The SEC acknowledges Do's cooperation in this matter."
