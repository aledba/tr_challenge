  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment finding that Richard S. of Rock Island County, Illinois, was unfit to be a parent.  The court also found that Richard failed to make reasonable efforts to correct the conditions that were the basis for L.J.S.'s removal.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Rock Island, Illinois on April 18, 2018, Richard was convicted of five felony counts of aggravated criminal sex abuse and sentenced to five 48-month terms of probation. The complaint alleges that, while incarcerated, Richard had been ordered to complete sex offender treatment and to complete a three-year course of treatment. Richard also was prohibited from having contact with the caseworker while he was in jail. The SEC alleges that Richard did not participate in any services that he was aware of, except for one day of self-report that he had begun receiving services at the Robert Young Center after he was released from prison.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Richard had not cooperated with the Department of Children and Family Services, the designated agency with which Richard was incarcerated, when he was required to complete the integrated assessment and to provide evidence to support his determination of whether he was depraved.  Richard's attorney, Lela Donaldson, agreed to the judgment and agreed to be enjoined from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Richard consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $750,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The judgment also prohibits Richard from participating in any type of child-rearing services, including parenting classes, sex education classes, or any other adult-based services, and requires him to comply with a court order requiring him to provide proof of his commitment to the child-registration program. Richard has also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar. The court granted Richard's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to sign a written consent to the placement and custody of a child under his control. The order also requires Richard to provide a final and convincing explanation of why he did not comply with the recommendation of the court, and that Richard must provide a \"self-assessment\" that demonstrates that he is not depraved and that he has complied with the requirements of Section 10"
