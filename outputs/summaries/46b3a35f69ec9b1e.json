  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a child protection case that terminated her parental rights.  According to the SEC's complaint, Jane Doe was the mother of a child who was placed in foster care after police received a report of parental substance abuse and the child being left without a caregiver. The complaint alleges that, while Doe was in the custody of the Department of Health and Welfare, she did not participate in regular visits with the child and was not forthright about her substance abuse issues.  The complaint further alleges that Doe failed to complete her case plan, which required her to provide reasonable efforts to reunify the child with her family, and failed to provide consistent support for the child while she was in custody.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Doe arising from her failure to complete the case plan.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Doe consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Idaho Department of Child and Family Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage parents to check the backgrounds of their children by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Institutions.gov.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Office of Advocacy and Education has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint to encourage parents and guardians to check on their children before making any decisions about whether or not to terminate their parental rights based on reasonable efforts. The Office of Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of misusing investor funds to pay for personal expenses, such as tuition, credit card bills, and to provide for a private school tuition program for children in need of remediation. The\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investigations have been conducted in conjunction with the\u00c2\u00a0Adviser's Office and\u00c2\u00a0Commission on Child Abuse and Abuse. \u00a0The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Idaho Division of Child Advocacy."
