  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas yesterday entered a final judgment against Ruben Aleman, M.D., a licensed Texas physician, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Aleman violated Section 193.005 of the Texas Medical Practice Act by failing to submit a medical certification on a death certificate.  According to the complaint, Aleman was not permitted to depose or call as a witness at trial the person he identifies as his \"accuser,\" the staff attorney who filed the complaint.  Aleman also allegedly failed to sign the medical certification for the death certificate of one of his patients.  In a second issue, the Texas Attorney General's Office (DOA) issued an order imposing an administrative penalty of $3,000 and ordering Aleman to take and pass the Medical Jurisprudence Exam with a score of 75 or above and to complete sixteen hours of continuing medical education in the topics of ethics and risk management.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in Aleman's complaint, the DOJ and the Texas Health and Safety Code (TSA) have agreed to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin Aleman from violating the federal securities laws, order him to pay a civil penalty of up to $5,000, and impose an officer-and-director bar against Aleman.  On May 7, 2013, the TSA issued a disciplinary order requiring Aleman not to comply with the Board's order, and ordering him to sign a written statement and to submit to the Board a copy of the disciplinary order. Aleman agreed to settle the SEC's action by consenting to a judgment that enjoins him from violating these provisions, and from participating in any disciplinary proceeding in the future. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing on May 13, 2018, was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. for Aleman and a hearing scheduled for 12:30 p.m., for which Aleman consented to entry of the final judgment. The hearing was conducted by Gerald R. Kasper and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a medical device using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of anyone offering or selling any investment using the\u00c2\u00a0"
