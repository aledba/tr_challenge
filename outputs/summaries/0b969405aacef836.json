  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against United Parcel Service Co. (UPS) on consent, finding that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that UPS violated the arbitration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of its contracts.  According to the court's order, UPS failed to enforce its right to arbitration, and instead relied on a boilerplate merger clause to prevent it from acting as an arbitrator.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against UPS.  Among other things, the court also ordered UPS to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million.  As alleged in the complaint, UPS also failed to comply with a court order requiring it to determine whether it had a right to compel arbitration based on the arbitration provision in its contract.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, with the amount to be determined by the court at a later date.  UPS has also agreed to pay civil penalties in the future.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges UPS with violating the anti-fraud provision of its contract and seeks a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar.  To learn more about arbitration, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Marc Blau, Chief of the SEC Division of Enforcement. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
