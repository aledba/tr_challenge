  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against The Burkhart Family Trust, L.L.C., an Ohio-based oil and gas company, and its owner, Jeff Miley d.b.a. Miley Gas Company, finding that Miley violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ohio, alleges that the court improperly shifted the burden of proof on Miley to prove that the Well was producing in paying quantities.  According to the complaint, Miley failed to report any production on any of the wells until late 2013, when Miley suggested that he submit its production to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR).  The complaint further alleges that, based on the court's finding, that the well was not producing in paid quantities, the burden shifted to Miley and Antero, and Miley was liable for disgorgement of $10,211 in 2012 and a loss of $76,126 in 2013.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Miley also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Miley.  On May 27, 2015, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered Miley's return of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordered him to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $75,000, respectively.  A hearing on June 26, 2015 was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office, and the Ohio Attorney General's Office in this matter."
