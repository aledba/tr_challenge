  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Pennsylvania yesterday entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania-based masonry contractor who was found liable in a civil injunctive action for his alleged role in a 2013 electrocution that resulted in the loss of his right arm and left leg.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Pittsburgh, alleges that Steven Mader, a former mason contractor, worked on a two week project involving repairs to the chimney, fireplace and front stoop of an existing home in the North Hills of Pittsburgh. According to the complaint, Mader used a sixteen foot aluminum extension ladder to check the gutters and then, carrying the ladder perpendicular to the ground, began walking from the home to place the ladder on his truck. The complaint alleges that the jury found Mader entitled to a new trial on past medical expenses and future lost earning capacity, and that Mader did not follow all doctor's orders in granting the new trial. Mader also allegedly sought alternative employment after his injury. The SEC alleges that, based on Mader's inconsistent use of the devices, the jury's award of $444,525.56 was erroneous because the jury did not consider the evidence presented at trial supported by the record, and Mader ultimately survived what could have been a fatal electric-chair electric-assisted death.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Mader to pay $55,474.44 in disgorgement, $40,221 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mader. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The examination was conducted in the Office of Advocacy and Public Health, with the assistance of Trial Counsel Robert C. Hannan of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The exam was performed in the absence of any evidence to support the jury finding Mader liable for the alleged injuries."
