  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against California-American Water Company, a public water utility, and its former CEO, Stephen Collins, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Monterey, California, alleges that the defendants violated Section 1090 of the Exchange Act by failing to show that they had a sufficient \"financial interest\" in the contracts when they entered into those agreements.  According to the complaint, the defendants also failed to show sufficient financial interest to qualify the contracts as valid.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to the defendants' representations to the court, the agreements were not subject to the 60-day limitation period under which they were entered into, and that Collins had a significant role in drafting the contracts.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Marina and the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and order them to pay disgorgement of $160,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000. The judgments also order the defendants to pay civil penalties of $20,000 each.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in San Bernardino, California seeking summary judgment against Monterey and Collins for violations of Sections 9(a), 10(c), and 13(b)(5) and 14(a) of Exchange Act Rules 10b2-1 and 14a-1 thereunder, and seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations.  On November 24, 2015, the court entered a judgment against the defendants, finding that the parties had a reasonable basis to believe that the contracts were valid and that they would be subject to court approval. The court also found that Monterey had a \"reasonable basis\" to believe it was entitled to a judgment that would determine whether it had a valid, legal, and binding contract.  Monterey's complaint also alleged that Collins failed to demonstrate that he had a cognizable interest in the agreements because he had been paid for his work and could have reasonably expected to receive more work.  It further alleged that, in a parallel action, Monterey filed a cross-complaint against Collins, alleging that he violated Section 9(c) and 10(e) of\u00c2\u00a0Exchange Act\u00c2\u00a0\u00a7\u00a71090 and Rule 9e-3 thereunder and that he was liable for a civil injunctive action"
