  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York today entered a final judgment against Denver Sheriff Brady Lovingier, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver on September 24, 2013, Mr. Waller alleges that Denver violated the federal securities laws by failing to adequately train and supervise deputy sheriffs in the Denver Sheriff Department.  The complaint alleges that Deputy Lovingier engaged in an unprovoked and unjustified assault on a restrained, compliant inmate who was simply standing where he had been directed to stand, next to an elevator.  As alleged in the complaint, this conduct was so egregious that it was highly predictable that a deputy sheriff in charge of the Sheriff Department would use excessive force against an individual who was not acting in a threatening manner.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s findings, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from future violations of the securities laws.  In addition, the court granted the SEC the right to determine whether or not to issue a civil injunctive relief order against the city of Denver, the county sheriff, and the Denver Police Department, as well as to determine the appropriate amount of civil penalties to be imposed upon the city.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order suspending Mr. Lovingier from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the municipal securities laws for a period of five years.  On October 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in Denver granted the District Court's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Rule 12(b)(6) and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Connick and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Denver Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by John R. Conklin and Ms. Conner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Denver Office of Professional Regulation, the Colorado Department of Criminal Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Colorado, and other emergency relief agencies."
