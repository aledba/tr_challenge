  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against SpeedyPC Pro, a software company that claims to provide software solutions to improve computer performance.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, charges Speedy with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  According to the complaint, Speedy's claims arise from a pattern of misstatements, misrepresentations, and omissions in the software's diagnostic capabilities.  For example, the complaint alleges that the software uniformly reported \"problems\" and \"errors\" when it mislabeled innocuous and routine features, and issued a low performance rating before any scan had begun.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against the defendants.

The court found that the defendants violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by failing to adequately consider the relevant facts of the case.  It also found that, contrary to what Speedy claimed, the Defendants violated Rule 23(b)-3 thereunder.  Specifically, it found that Speedy violated Section 15(a), Section 17(d) of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14, and Rule 15a-1 thereunder and that it violated Rule 15b2-2 thereunder by not requiring the defendants to show cause and effect in connection with the alleged violations of Rule 15e-3.  On a related note, the court also ruled that, based on the court's finding, that the Defendants' misrepresentations of computer health to induce users to buy the software did not constitute a sufficient basis for class certification.  Finally, the Court found that:  The Defendants violated Sections 13(e) and 14("
