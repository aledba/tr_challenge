  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon in possession of a firearm in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, in 2011, the Tennessee Attorney General's Office issued an arrest warrant for Victor J. Stitt, who was convicted of a felony for Tennessee aggravated burglary. According to the complaint, Stitt entered the building after realizing that the owner had formed a false impression that the defendant intended to enter his residence for the purpose of purchasing a drink. The complaint further alleges that Stitt did not enter the building with the intent to commit a felony, theft, or assault. Instead, the complaint alleges that he simply entered without the owner\u2019s knowledge of his or her intent. The SEC alleges that this is a form of generic burglary that is broader than generic burglary because generic burglary requires the defendant to enter a habitation with intent to steal a drink, and thus could not serve as a predicate offense under the federal securities laws. The court also ruled that, as alleged in the SEC complaint, that, while Stitt had a history of felony burglary, he had not committed a felony or attempted to commit an additional felony. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Stitt.  In a related matter, the SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Tennessee Department of Justice in this matter."
