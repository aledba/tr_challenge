  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a California-based family member who was charged with a felony drug possession charge.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that, on December 10, 2015, the California Department of Children and Family Services (CDFS) and its parent, Marcus C., Sr., violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the parents failed to follow the department\u2019s recommendation to remove the child from the apartment and that they did not take sufficient care of the child. According to the complaint, the child fell out of a second story window and hit his head and chin on the ground. The court found that, based on the evidence presented at the hearing, the parents were at risk of serious physical harm and/or abuse, and that the child was in the care of his maternal grandmother, who had recently been evicted from an apartment for nonpayment of rent and smoking marijuana all day. The SEC also alleged that, prior to the fall, the mother and father had been living with the maternal grandmother for extended periods of time, and they had failed to take the child to the post-fall medical appointment when they were confronted by a neighbor about the child falling out of the window.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requiring the defendants to pay civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the parents.  On March 17, 2016, the District Court entered a temporary restraining order against the father and mother-in-law, ordering the father to surrender his passport, and ordering the mother to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The order also barred the father from serving as an officer or director of a public school, and from participating in any child safety and parenting services. The case was investigated by the Office of Inspector General and the Department of Justice Criminal Division's Office of Child and Family Education and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Andrew S. and Ms. Javorski and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Jennifer C. McKinley and Eric R. Werner of the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office."
