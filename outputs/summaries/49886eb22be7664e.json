  "summary": "On December 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Texas entered a final judgment against Texas-based construction company Shoring Engineers, Inc. (Shoring) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's order, filed on April 13, 2017, Shoring requested that J.D. Fields and Company, Inc., a California-based company, locate and supply a specially fabricated steel piling for a Los Angeles International Airport project.  The SEC alleges that Shoring agreed to the solicitation of an offer, but did not sign it.  As alleged in the complaint, the solicitation was a fraudulent scheme, and Shoring failed to show that he had signed the solicitation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's judgment, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering Shoring to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  Shoring also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Shoring for his role in the alleged scheme.  On March 20, 2017 a federal district court in Texas issued an order suspending Shoring from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  This order temporarily enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws and orders him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty, a $25,000 officer-and-director bar, and an officer and director bar, as well as a penny stock bar.   The court's order freezes Shoring's assets and prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of service.  To learn more about liability, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17 (Feb. 26, 2019).  In related proceedings, the SEC today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of Shoring and his company, Axelson & Co., Inc. v. Fort Worth Regional Office, and the Texas Department of Securities and Exchange Commission (DFCA) in connection with the alleged violations of Section 5 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Rule 5a-14 thereunder, and that the court will consider the merits of the proposed remedies."
