  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Daniel J. Gonzales, a convicted felon who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole plus forty-eight years of pre-judgment interest.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, alleges that Gonzales violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Gonzales consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Gonzales also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, or any other jurisdiction, for the purpose of obtaining a judgment imposing permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Gonzales.    In its complaint, the SEC also charged Gonzales with violating Section 901 of the Exchange Act, and charged him with aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(b)(5) and 14(e) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant agreed to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar prohibiting him from associating with any third party in a criminal case. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael H. Graham, Christopher B. Mueller, and Laird C. Kirkpatrick of the Denver Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Attorney General's Office, the FBI, and the Colorado Office of Criminal Investigations."
