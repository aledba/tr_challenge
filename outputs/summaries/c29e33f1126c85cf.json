  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a New Jersey man for his role in a drug-trafficking organization that distributed heroin in New Jersey.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, alleges that, in 2015, the New Jersey Attorney General's Office obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of a convicted felon who was involved in a scheme to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 100 grams or more of heroin.  According to the complaint, when confronted by federal agents and charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the attorney general's order froze the assets and issued a temporary restraining order suspending the asset freeze and other emergency relief.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has issued an order freezing assets held by the convicted felon and ordering him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $30,000 to $5 million.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the New York District Court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze against the felon in possession of a firearm and ordered him to surrender his passport.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, imposes a $75,000 civil penalty, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The court's order freezes the assets held in the escrowed escrow account and orders the forfeiture of any assets that may have been obtained from the alleged illegal distribution of the illicit drug. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter."
