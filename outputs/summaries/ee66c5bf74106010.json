  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Shaklee Corporation, a manufacturer and distributor of natural nutrition supplements, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal trademark laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that Superior Consulting Services, Inc., a registered nurse, and its owner, E. Remy Martin & Co., S.W. Fla., Inc., violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 5b-5(b) and (c) thereunder.  According to the complaint, Shaklee and Superior agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  In its complaint, the court also found that Superior failed to establish a likelihood of confusion when it registered its mark with the federal district court for the Northern District of Georgia and entered a preliminary injunction against the defendants.   The court also ruled that the defendants violated the anti-fraud provision of Section 15 of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-1 thereunder, and that the court had the right to order the defendants to comply with the court's order. \u00c2\u00a0The court agreed to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the federal registration provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  On August 6, 2017, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the Atlanta District Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the defendants\u2019 assets, including the assets of Superior and Sansone, and ordered Shaklee to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the judge granted the court\u2019s request for an asset freeze and a bar against the Defendants from further association with any third-party manufacturer or distributor of any product or service, including, without limitation, from purchasing or selling any of the Defendants\u2019 products in the United States.  As a result of the court order, the defendants will be prohibited from violating these provisions and the court will determine the amount of monetary relief to be imposed upon the defendants based on the relief ordered against them by the district court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (Feb. 21, 2017).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant:\u00c2\u00a0Superior Consulting Services Inc. v. Shaklee, Inc. (Aug. 22, 2017)"
