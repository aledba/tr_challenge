  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a Bexar County jail guard who was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in 2004.  According to the SEC's complaint, on February 14, 2004, Christopher Nieto, who was a jail guard at the time of Espada\u2019s trial, was called by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to testify that he was under FBI investigation, had been suspended for a previous felony, theft over $1,500, on August 23, 2010, and was about to be sentenced for capital murder.  The SEC alleges that, while Nieto was in jail, Espada allegedly engaged in a fight with another inmate and used a Tylenol-like substance to kick the other inmate out of the cell.  Nieto also allegedly told the jail guard that he had a gun and was ready to \"smash on him, you know.\"  The complaint further alleges that after Espada left the jail, Nieto followed him to his apartment, entered the apartment through the balcony, and shot him three times with a.45 revolver.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendant had a poor conscience and no remorse.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he did not know that his brother-in-law left a marijuana joint in his vehicle and Espada used it to kick out another inmate who was trying to kick him out.    In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Nieto arising from the same conduct that led to his conviction.  On November 12, 2012, the trial court granted a temporary restraining order against Nieto and ordered him to return to the jail.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Nieto consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, which includes a five-year officer-and-director bar, and a three-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in any type of criminal proceeding.  Finally, the court granted the SEC request for a hearing on the merits of the case against Nieto, which is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley of the Fort Worth Regional Office. "
