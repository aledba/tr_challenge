  "summary": "On May 17, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment in favor of Senn II, a Texas man convicted of second-degree felony sexual assault, and ordered him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fort Worth, Senn falsely told a jury that he was engaged in a long-running, multi-year relationship with Brenda Senn, who was his step-mother. Senn also allegedly told the jury that Senn was prohibited from marrying or claiming to marry a person other than his spouse, and that he had no interest in living with the victim under the appearance of being married. The complaint further alleges that the jury found Senn guilty of violating Section 22.011(f) of the Texas Penal Code, which requires the state to prove facts constituting bigamy when it alleges that a defendant committed a sexual assault. The court also ruled that the state was required to prove the elements of bigamy in its opinion that it had held in Arteaga that under the federal criminal code, a defendant is prohibited from engaging in a bigamy relationship with a person who is not married under the bigamy statute. The Court of Criminal Appeals agreed with the court's finding, which is subject to court approval, that the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties will be determined by the court at a later date. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David S. Thompson and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Attorney General's Office, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
