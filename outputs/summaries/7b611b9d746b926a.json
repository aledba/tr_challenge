  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arkansas today entered a final judgment in a civil injunctive action against DeSoto Drilling, Inc. (\"DeSoto\"), a company that owns and operates gas compressors, gas-gathering systems, and related equipment.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on August 24, 2015 in the Faulkner County Court, filed by Angela Hill, a nonresident attorney in her official capacity as the state's attorney for the purpose of representing a person not licensed to practice law in this state, that Hill filed an unauthorized practice of law complaint on behalf of a corporation, limited liability company, or other business entity in violation of the federal antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hill has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  The judgment also prohibits her from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from appearing as an attorney at the time of an administrative proceeding.  In addition, the court granted Hill's request for a temporary restraining order and an order suspending her from appearing before the court.  On November 2, 2016, the SEC filed a motion to dismiss and dismissed Hill's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, which was granted by the court on September 9, 2016. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Ms. Hill. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and Carol S. Cotter of the SEC Enforcement Division's Fort Worth Regional Office. The investigation was supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley and Glenn S. Gordon in the Fort Worth office. The examination was conducted in the SEC Office of Compliance and Assessments by Eric J. Werner in the Division of Enforcement's Office of Inspector General. The examiners will be assisted by the case manager."
