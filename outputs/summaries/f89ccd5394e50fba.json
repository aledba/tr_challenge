  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a temporary restraining order against a defendant accused of orchestrating a triple-murder in the Polo Grounds public housing complex.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that defendant John R. \"Jay\" Davis, a convicted felon who was previously incarcerated at Rikers Island, and his wife Nicole A. Davis, who lived in the complex, made false statements to the court in connection with the November 14, 2011 shooting death of Archie Phillips.  According to the complaint, Davis was confronted by a man who had been arrested for a drug-related crime and was later sentenced to prison.  Davis allegedly told the man that he was going to \"send a clear message\" to Phillips and that Phillips was \"out of here.\"  The complaint further alleges that Davis was the only witness who was present at the time of the shooting, and that the man who shot Phillips was the son of one of his robbery victims.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant failed to turn over a witness who corroborated Davis's account of the events.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Davis consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000 and a $500,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Additionally, Davis agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of a penny stock, and to be barred from the securities industry.  As a result of the settlement, Davis will not be able to participate in the selection of a jury for the rest of his life.  To learn more about the Brady rule, see Investor.gov/InvestorSecurities."
