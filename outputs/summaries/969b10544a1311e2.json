  "summary": "On June 19, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in Appellees' motion for summary judgment against them for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, Appellant alleges that Gary Croft, Aaron Samuels, and Christopher Bagi, all of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (ODRC), acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical condition, causing a delay in scheduling surgery and treatment of his eye, which in turn caused his condition to worsen.  The complaint also alleges that Appelant was not properly treated at BCCI, and that he was taken to the Ohio State University Hospital for follow-up care.  Appelleant also allegedly failed to provide any evidence that any of these defendants were directly involved with the alleged denial of medical care for him.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced that it has obtained a judgment ordering summary judgment in Appellee Bagi's favor against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Appellee consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, prejudgment interest of $2,098.81, and a civil penalty of $10,000. The court also issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee Appellante's medical care. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kelly Riehle, Brendan Pyszka, and Paul Weidman of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by David Keeley and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Chicago Regional Office. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Office of Inspector General.
