  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on November 8, 2017, entered a final judgment against Anthony \"Tony\" Lord on two counts of murder.  According to the court's order, in July 2015, Lord went on a multi-hour, violent rampage through Aroostook and Penobscot Counties.  The court found that, in setting the basic sentence for each of the murders, Lord had engaged in a series of potentially fatal and persistently violent acts that left two people dead and three others injured.  As alleged in the order, the court improperly considered the mitigating factors, including Lord's genuine love for his son, his post-traumatic stress following his son's death, his support of his family, and the fact that he took full responsibility for his actions in pleading guilty to the murders.  In sentencing Lord on the remaining convictions, he was sentenced to two concurrent life sentences, with the rest to be determined by the court at a later date.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Lord consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $'38,046.75.  He also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, other than for his own personal benefit, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael R. Hoke and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
