  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins a California attorney from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Lake Havasu, California, alleges that Jean Victor Peloquin, the managing member of a limited liability company, and his son, Terry L. Fleming, Jr. (the majority shareholder's brother and a director of the LLC), improperly represented the LLC and its managing member in a cross-complaint filed in the same federal district court in June 2011.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to adequately represent the interests of the majority shareholder and the other defendants in the litigation.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants had a duty of loyalty to the company and a duty to protect their interests.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requiring him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  To settle the case, the judge granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of $1,253,078, which is equal to the amount of their civil penalties, and a $100,000 civil penalty. The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the Commission on Professional Responsibility and Conduct, and ordering them to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $75,000, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On May 24, 2012, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the San Francisco District Court entered a judgment against the defendants that permanently restrains them from violating these provisions, and orders them to jointly represent the entity and its management against any other person or entity who has obtained confidential information from the defendants. The judgment also orders the SEC to appoint a receiver to represent the defendants in connection with the Commission's investigation of the alleged misconduct. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunction, and the appointment of a receiver. The case is being handled by Eric R. Werner and Glenn S. Gordon of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner, Ms. Gordon, and Mr. Gordon."
