  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment in favor of the trustee and personal representative of a Michigan-based charitable trust.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Michigan, alleges that, on June 12, 2018, the trustee, Samer Mahdy Ali, was appointed associate professor in the Department of Near Eastern Studies at the University of Michigan with the intention of establishing a full professorship in late medieval Arabic literature.  According to the complaint, after learning of the trustees' failure to enforce the terms of the charitable trust and the Gift Agreement, the trustees allegedly distributed funds to the university in the form of $3,500,000 to be distributed to a separate charitable trust to fulfill Professor Bellamy\u2019s wishes.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney General's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Ali, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Ali consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078,098, and a civil penalty of $100,000, and requires him to provide a copy of the judgment to the trustee.  On August 5, 2011, the court granted summary disposition in the civil action action against Ali and ordered the trustee to maintain a record of his receipt of funds from the trust and to provide an accounting of the amount of the funds distributed to the trustees.  At the same time, the judge issued a temporary restraining order halting the distribution of the trust funds, ordering the trustee not to violate the trust or the gift agreement, and appointing an associate professor of a different specialty as trustee for the purpose of enforcing a charitable trust pursuant to MCL 700.7405(3).  The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 7405(2).  In its order granting summary disposition, the SEC also issued an order suspending the trustee from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney or as a judge in a case involving a trustee or trustee of a public university.   The court's order also temporarily suspended the trustee's ability to file a civil action against the trustee in the future. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Andrew D. Martin, Trevor Le Gassick, and Amy Gwiazda of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, with assistance from John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0"
