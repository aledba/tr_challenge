  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Badrudin Kurwa and Mark Kislinger, both ophthalmologists, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Santa Barbara, Kurwa, a California resident, and Kislinger began a venture to provide medical services to patients of a health maintenance organization and formed a corporation for that purpose.  The complaint alleges that the defendants agreed, expressly and on the record, that they would seek an appellate ruling on all but one of the causes of action, that for breach of fiduciary duty and to waive the applicable statute of limitations.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the judgment did not resolve all of the issues raised by the complaint.  Instead, the complaint alleges, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and requires them to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Defendants agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment imposing a permanent injunction and to the issuance of a cease-and-desist order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Kurwa.   The SEC's Complaint charges Kurwa with violating Section 904.1 of the Exchange Act and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Kislinger. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
