  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment in favor of a Washington, D.C., man who is charged with violating the federal anti-fraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Ronald Brett, a resident of Vanderburgh County, Indiana, raised the issue of whether a federal court should issue an order suspending or suspending spousal and child support obligations arising from his dissolved marriage to Caroline Martin.  According to the complaint, the court found that Brett failed to meet his burden of establishing a permissible defense under the federal law when, in fact, he did not have any of the statutory defenses required to prove invalidity of the order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Indiana today announced criminal charges against Brett.  On June 30, 2016, a federal judge issued an order requiring Brett to pay $1,300 to a Canadian court for support and maintenance of a support recipient's wife. The court granted Brett a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $6,000.  Brett agreed to drop his application to the Ontario court for relief from paying back child support and to withdraw the garnishment notice that she had served on Brett's employer.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Brett consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to comply with the court's order. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the United Kingdom Department of Social and Health Services, the Canadian Department of Child Support, and the Washington Department of State Department of Health Services."
