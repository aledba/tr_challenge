  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a $400,000 securities fraud case.  The SEC's complaint alleges that John Gleason, who was one of Jansen\u2019s co-defendants at the time, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Gleason failed to prove that Jansen had perjured himself at the bankruptcy trial by failing to disclose that he had used a bank account in the name of a company that was involuntarily dissolved in 1999 to cover closing costs in a business acquisition. According to the complaint, Gleason also failed to establish that the account in question was never owned by Jansen, despite the fact that the bank account involved in the criminal case had been closed in 2003. The SEC alleges that, contrary to Gleason's testimony, Jansen never fully refunded the money to him after it fell through, and Gleason tried pursuing Jansen in the bankruptcy litigation. The court ultimately denied his motion for summary judgment and ordered Jansen to pay $141,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. Jansen agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Gleason. The case was investigated by the SEC's Asset Management Unit and the Chicago Regional Office, and the case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Jennifer Chun Barry and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Boston Regional Office.
