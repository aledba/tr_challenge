  "summary": "On March 19, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered an emergency consent judgment against Debtor Venoco LLC, a California-based private equity firm, in an emergency action to halt the sale of assets in the South Ellwood Field.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 17, 2017, the Court entered a consent judgment in favor of the Trustee in a parallel action against the State of California and the California State Lands Commission.  The court held that the Court had jurisdiction over the estate and that it had jurisdiction to determine whether to proceed with an adversary proceeding based upon the facts of the estate.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the court did not have jurisdiction to deal with the estate because of the nature of the bankruptcy proceeding.  In its order, which entered a final consent judgment on May 23, 2018, Judge Sontchi ruled that the court had jurisdiction under the federal bankruptcy laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.   The Court's order also prohibits Venoco from participating in or participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the final judgment, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 587 B.R. 6, 12-13 (Bankr. D. Del. 2018).
