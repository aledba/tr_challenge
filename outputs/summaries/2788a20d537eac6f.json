  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Chicago Bridge & Iron Co.'s (\u201cChicago\u201d) claims that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1208 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on August 19, 2016, Turner was hired as a carpenter's helper at a construction site near Hackberry, Louisiana, and immediately reported the injury to his supervisor. The complaint further alleges that Turner failed to tell his supervisor that he had suffered a back injury and needed to forgo medication and physical therapy in order to deal with the pain. Turner also allegedly failed to disclose his prior diagnosis of \"bulging\" or \"protruding\" discs in his lower back.  According to the complaint, Turner also failed to show any signs of having a herniated disc in his back when he went to a chiropractor to pop his back once, maybe twice, and an MRI/x-ray taken approximately a year and a half before the work accident.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Turner.  On October 5, 2016 the U. S. District Judge in New York granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze against Turner and ordered him to pay $17,500 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and ordered Turner to pay a civil penalty of $14,500.  Turner agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.   The court's order also prohibits Turner from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order, and orders Turner to comply with the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains, and imposes civil penalties of $18,500 and $6,500, respectively.  To settle the case against Turner, the court also ordered that the amount of any civil monetary penalty be determined by the SEC at a later date upon motion of the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1221(3)(c)(i).  The complaint also seeks permanent injunctions against future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws and a conduct-based injunction prohibiting Turner from serving as an officer or director of a public company or participating in any officer-and-director disciplinary proceeding. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John R.
