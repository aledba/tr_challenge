  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of a second-degree murder in 2000.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Paul Scrimo, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for orchestrating the April 12, 2000, double-murder of Ruth Williams, was unlawfully barred from appearing as a witness in a criminal case.  According to the complaint, the defendant, John Kane, was the only person present at the time of the murder when the trial court ruled that Kane was a drug dealer who had been barred from selling drugs, and that Kane had a prior relationship with the victim.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Manhattan today announced criminal charges against Kane.  On September 29, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Kane, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, LLC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Kane consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000.  To learn more about third-party culpability, see Litigation Release No. 1782.  For further information about third parties who are liable for third-parties' involvement in criminal prosecutions, see Criminal Justice Reform Bulletin No. 206 (1) and Criminal Justice Bulletin no. 20623 (2) (4) (3).  The complaint also names John Kane as a defendant for the purpose of establishing the credibility of a third party in the criminal case, and seeks a permanent injunction against further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws.  Additionally, the complaint seeks a temporary restraining order against Kane from appearing or practicing before the SEC as well as an officer-and-director bar in the future, and a bar prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any drug.  A hearing is scheduled for May 5, 2018, for which the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Office of Professional and Risk Analysis."
