  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Louisiana man who was convicted of second-degree murder in the death of his daughter.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on February 2, 2007, defendant, Kenneth Anderson, of Glenmora, Louisiana, entered a guilty plea in a civil injunctive action against his mother, Effie LeBleu, who was also charged in the same case.  According to the complaint, the defendant told his mother that he was going to change the baby's diaper and that he would \"pat\" the baby on the back of the head.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the defendant allegedly hit the baby with a belt and used a fly swatter on the baby, causing the baby to cry and to fall to the floor.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the baby was not responsive to the defendant's repeated requests for medical attention, and the mother did not respond.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Anderson.  On January 4, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action and obtained a temporary restraining order against Anderson, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC findings, Anderson consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about second- degree murder, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-11."
