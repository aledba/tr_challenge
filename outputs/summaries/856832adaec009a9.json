  "summary": "On May 24, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a Texas-based home health care provider and its contractor in a Medicare reimbursement case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, in 2008, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued a directive requiring CMS to use statistical sampling in the context of post-payment claims to determine whether a beneficiary was \"homebound\" when, in fact, the beneficiary was not homebound.  According to the complaint, the directive also required CMS to consider whether a patient could leave home without a \"known\" probability of selection.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the directive requires CMS to check the background of any claims submitted by a beneficiary and determine whether the patient was \"committed to the homebound\" by the provider.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, CMS has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.

It also agreed to pay an officer and director bar and a penny stock bar in a separate administrative proceeding.  Finally, the court agreed to a judgment ordering the company to comply with the Commission's order, ordering it to provide a copy of the final judgment to the Commission, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against future violations of these provisions.  Additionally, the Commission agreed to an order appointing a receiver to oversee the collection and processing of all claims under the Medicare program, including those related to the beneficiary's illness or injury, and that the receiver would be required to provide an accounting of any overpayment that occurred during the collection, processing, or processing of the claims.  Among other things, the Court ordered the receiver to send an email to the receiver informing him of the receiver's receipt of the overpayment.    The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office and supervised by"
