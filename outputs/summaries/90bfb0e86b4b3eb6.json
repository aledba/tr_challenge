  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a Missouri man who was convicted of multiple felony counts of rape, forcible sodomy, and armed criminal action for which he was sentenced to a total of sixty years in prison.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbia, Missouri, alleges that on August 4, 1993, a light-skinned black man dressed in black and wearing a mask and fingerless gloves approached the night auditor at the Super 8 Motel in Harrisonville, Missouri and demanded to know how to get into the cash register.  According to the complaint, Dixon agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 547.037 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Dixon also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged crimes.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Dixon.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Dixon has consented to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert in the field of forensic evidence.  On August 5, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Dixon, charging him with securities fraud, aiding and abetting his violations of the federal securities laws, and providing for the appointment of a receiver to determine whether a defendant is entitled to a fair trial.
