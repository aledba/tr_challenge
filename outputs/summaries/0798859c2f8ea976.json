  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alaska today entered a final judgment against the Corkerys, who are seeking to have their variance granted.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Anchorage, Alaska, Patrick and Brooke Corkery owned and operated an Anchorage home since 1998. The complaint alleges that, in 2013, the Municipality of Anchorage issued a certificate of occupancy (LLO) for a two-story, 2,359-square-foot home that was substantially expanded to allow for the addition of a 184-square foot greenhouse to the home.  The complaint further alleges that in 2014, the city issued a conditional permit for the home, which required the property to meet certain criteria, including that the lot coverage be substantially met.  In addition, the complaint alleged that in 2013 the municipality issued an order requiring the building to be substantially expanded so that the home could be used as part of a reasonable use of the property.  As alleged in the complaint, this order violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the equitable doctrine of laches prohibits the issuance of a variance without first obtaining a court order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt of the Boston Regional Office, and is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Ms. Curt. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alaska Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Anchorage Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations Division and the Alaska Office of the Attorney General's Office."
