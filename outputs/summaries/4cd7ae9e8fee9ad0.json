  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment in favor of the Courtneys' motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The Courtneys, who reside in Stehekin, Washington, filed a complaint in 2009 alleging that the Washington State Department of Transportation (WUTC) improperly granted them the right to operate a year-round commercial ferry service on Lake Chelan.  According to the complaint, the WUTC issued a preliminary injunction in May 2014, freezing the assets of the courtneys and ordering them to obtain a copy of the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $37 per adult passenger for a one-way ticket and $74 for a round trip.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged scheme.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court papers, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the court to issue an order permanently freezing the defendants\u2019 assets and prohibiting them from soliciting investments in any of the above-mentioned entities. The court also issued an order temporarily suspending the operation of certain ferry services on the same day that it issued the preliminary injunction.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the U. S. District court for the Eastern District of New York granted the court-ordered injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0The\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act of 1940 and Rule\u00c2\u00a0206(4)-8 thereunder. The order also prohibits the issuance of a \"certificate of convenience and necessity\" without first obtaining an exemption from the Commission. The SEC previously issued a similar order in a similar action in 2009. The Courtney's complaint, filed in federal district court in Seattle, charges the defendants with violating Sections 206 and 206 of the Investment Advisers Act, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Seattle Regional Office, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson."
