  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Charles Hall and Wesley Coonce in a related criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Springfield, Missouri, alleges that Hall and Coonce engaged in a double-counting scheme to convince a jury that they were entitled to determine whether a death penalty should be imposed based on the aggravating and mitigating factors presented to the jury.  According to the complaint, Hall told the jury that he had been asked to testify in over one thousand criminal cases, including some high-profile prosecutions.  He also claimed that in one of those cases, Hall had threatened to kill a federal judge and prosecutors, and that in another case, he had attempted to choke a fellow inmate to death.  As the complaint alleges, the jury deliberated for less than an hour before finding Hall guilty.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the evidence presented to it by the SEC.  Hall has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by agreeing to a permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Hall has consented to the entry of a final judgement that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $1,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, from participating in any type of criminal proceeding, including serving a five-year prison sentence.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney for New York, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Missouri Department of Criminal Justice."
