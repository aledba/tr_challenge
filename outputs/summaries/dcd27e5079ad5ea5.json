  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia today entered final judgments against two insurance companies for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charleston, West Virginia, alleges that, in 2010, BrickStreet Mutual Insurance Company (BrickStreet) and Taggart Site Services Group (Taggart), a professional employer organization (PEO), violated the reporting and reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that in 2011, when BrickStreet was required to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage for covered employees, it failed to do so because the PEO and client-employer were not parties to the agreement. The SEC alleges that the same year, in a separate case, the same company failed to pay workers' compensation insurance to an injured employee.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for West Virginia announced criminal charges against the company.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed today in federal district court in W. Va., BrickStreet and Toggart agreed to settle the matter without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 13, 2016, the court entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the companies from violating the reporting, reporting, and reporting provision of the securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000. The court also ordered the companies to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordered the company to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount owed to the company in the civil penalty. The final judgment also orders the company and its insurance carrier to pay $75,000 in civil penalties, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  A parallel administrative proceeding has been instituted against the companies, and the litigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the West Virginia Office of Inspections and Examinations. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia Department of Insurance, the State Attorney General's Office of Insurance Regulation, the Commonwealth of Virginia and the Virginia Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Insurance Regulatory Surveillance Authority, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Postal Inspection Service,"
