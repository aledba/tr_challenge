  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in a civil injunctive action brought by a federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Mississippi, on September 5, 2005, the Honorable Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Mississippi found that, in violation of Section 1115 of the federal health care law, the federal government overstated the number of days a hospital treated patients eligible for Medicaid under a state-funded program.  The court also found that the UCCP days were not included in the calculation because they were not part of a demonstration project.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court agreed with the court that the HHS violated the federal law by not including the days that patients were not eligible to receive Medicaid.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Health Education and Advocacy today issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling or offering them investments using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov\u00c2\u00a0finds\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0incredible\u00c2\u00a0history of\u00c2\u00a0misstatements\u00c2\u00a0in the\u00c2\u00a0Medicaid\u00c2\u00a0registration\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0patients.gov website\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0recognizes that\u00c2\u00a0these\u00c2\u00a0are\u00c2\u00a0instantaneous\u00c2\u00a0eligible for\u00c2\u00a0programmed assistance under the federal Medicaid program.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, and the Mississippi Department of Insurance in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed an amended complaint in the SEC Enforcement Division's Fraud Task Force on September 6, 2017, alleging that, based on the SEC\u2019s findings, the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the agency.  On October 2, 2017 the SEC issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent review of the effectiveness of its Medicaid program, which included evaluating whether to include certain days of care that were eligible for federal matching payments under the state plan or the federal program"
