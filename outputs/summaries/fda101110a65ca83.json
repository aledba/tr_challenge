  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Utah today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of multiple felony counts of sexual assault.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that defendant Anthony Charles Murphy violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Murphy consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Murphy also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Murphy.  On May 31, 2009, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Murphy, charging him with four counts of felony sexual assault and one count of second-degree burglary.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Murphy agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged conduct.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and Eric R. Werner of the Salt Lake Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Edward J. Imwinkelried.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Utah Office of Inspector General, the FBI's Criminal Investigations, the Department of Justice's Salt Lake Division of Public Health and the Utah Division of Criminal Investigations."
