  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of a Pennsylvania State Employee Retirement System (PSERS) pension case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that Jeffrey S. Zehner violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the court improperly relied on evidence elicited at the hearing to determine whether the parties had agreed to modify the 2015 consent order.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Husband and his ex-wife filed a civil injunctive action in which the court found that the defendants had violated the right to due process under the federal securities laws by failing to comply with the parties' consent orders.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Husband.  On September 15, 2017, the trial court entered a consent order for the modification of Wife's 2015 QDRO, which provided for the equitable distribution of her PSERS pension.  Husband agreed to the modification without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Complaint.  After the court entered the consent order, the parties agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000 and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  A final judgment that permanently enjoins Husband from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of his pension that he will receive.  Without admitting to these violations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 15(a) of the Exchange Act, and ordering the parties to jointly and severally pay civil penalties of $2,500,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services."
