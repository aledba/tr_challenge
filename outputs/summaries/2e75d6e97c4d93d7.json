  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against MetaSource Acquisitions, LLC, MetaSource Employee Services, LLC d/b/a MetaSource, and MetaSource's former supervisor, David Brodecki, finding that MetaSource violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, on February 20, 2017 MetaSource agreed to arbitration without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint that it had violated the arbitration provisions of the Exchange Act.  The complaint further alleges that, contrary to the representations of MetaSource in the arbitration agreement, the arbitration provision is not illusory because it is entirely optional with the employer, and the employer is permitted to make any changes by continuing to employ the employee.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the employer failed to provide any \"new and valuable consideration\" to the employee when it entered into an arbitration agreement with MetaSource.  MetaSource has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders MetaSource to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and orders the company to pay an $80,000 civil penalty to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the SEC.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott Specialty Gases, with assistance from John Rymas of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Specialty and Ms. Gases. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and the Pennsylvania Office of Financial Regulation.
