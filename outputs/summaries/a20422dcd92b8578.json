  "summary": "On March 8, 2008, the Washington Parish District Attorney's Office filed a civil injunctive action against Erick Townsend, Jr. and his co-defendant, Jeremy Wilson, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, prior to trial, both women recanted their statements in notarized affidavits, telling the court that they did not believe that defendant confessed his role in the murders to them.  According to the complaint, however, the defendants' statements to the police were inconsistent with the evidence presented to the court, and the defendants were not permitted to cross-examine each other as a witness.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Wilson and Wilson consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their respective profits.  On March 9, 2017, the Honorable Judge Crain of the United States District Court in New York granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against all defendants, and ordered Wilson to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Wilson agreed to a permanent injunction and to be barred from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  He also agreed to be prohibited from associating with any third-party witness, including a public defender, and to pay a civil penalty equal to his or her pre-judgmental approval of the motion for a preliminary injunction.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 597 (Feb. 26, 2017).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the FBI's Criminal Investigations, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Financial Services and Exchange Commission's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy."
