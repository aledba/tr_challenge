  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against Verizon Communications, Inc., Cellco Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless, and AOL Inc. (collectively, \"Verizon\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court found that the claims of the defendants violated the anti-dumping provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, the defendants failed to adequately disclose that the defendants' claims were directed to the abstract idea of using persistent identifiers to deliver targeted media, such as advertisements.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Bridge and Post consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the charged provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Patent Education and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Basinger and supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.K. Attorney\u2019s Office for New York, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
