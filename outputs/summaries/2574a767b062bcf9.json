  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Juvenile Court's motion for a temporary restraining order against a juvenile who was arrested for violating his probation.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City on February 8, 2018, the juvenile, who was previously incarcerated on probation violations, claimed that the court had jurisdiction over him when it found that he had violated the terms of his probation in 2015.  The complaint alleges that, despite having been sentenced to straight probation, the judge could not impose a sentence beyond that imposed in the original sentence on the juvenile.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that the juvenile did not identify his assailants immediately after the attack, and that, when the judge found the juvenile in violation of the probation violation finding, he did not impose the original suspended sentence.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the court did not have jurisdiction over the juvenile when he was incarcerated, and the judge did not grant the juvenile's request for a continuance.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a $20,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Philadelphia Regional Office by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Market Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York Office of Inspector General. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Criminal Investigations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov.
