  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware today entered a final judgment in favor of Delaware's right to counsel, which requires the court to determine whether a defendant's prior felony DUI conviction qualifies as a \"pre-judgmental judgment\" for a subsequent criminal conviction.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Maryland on January 21, 2018, Theodore J. Xenidis was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol in 2018 and sentenced to a prison term of three years and three months.  The complaint alleges that in addition to his 1991 Maryland DUI conviction, Xenidis also had a prior felony conviction for driving while intoxicated in 2018.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the Maryland conviction did not qualify as a pre-judgement judgment for a later criminal conviction, and Xenidis alleges that he was in fact fined $7,500 but given no jail time.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that Xenidis's 1991 Maryland felony conviction, which was deemed \"uncounseled\" by the Maryland court, was improperly used to enhance the severity of a prior criminal conviction for which he was previously sentenced.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's judgment, the court agreed that the Delaware Constitution provides for a presumption of regularity and a duty to protect the rights of the defendant. The court also agreed that a prior DUI conviction does not violate the federal due process provision of the federal criminal laws.  On January 24, 2019, the Court entered a judgment against Xenidis that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the Delaware constitution, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,500.  Xenidis agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a judgment that imposes a permanent injunction against further violations of the state's due process provisions, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil monetary penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  It also ordered Xenidis to comply with the court order requiring him to show cause and effect that he has waived his right to be represented by counsel in a criminal proceeding.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Maryland District Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Delaware Department of Justice in this matter."
