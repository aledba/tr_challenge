  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Oncor Electric Delivery Company, a Texas-based electrical equipment manufacturer, for making false or disparaging statements during two minutes of testimony before a Texas senate committee.  Oncor's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, alleges that Oncor violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint charges Oncor and Oncor with violations of the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Oncor agreed to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's complaint. Oncor also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, which is equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the company.   The Commission's final judgment, which entered final judgment on the matter, permanently enjoins Oncor from violating these provisions and orders Oncor to comply with the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar. The Commission has agreed to a permanent injunction, to be followed by a hearing in which it will consider the merits of its findings, and to a hearing that will determine whether to proceed with a related administrative proceeding. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Insurance, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Press Release No. 17-cv-17 (March 25, 2013)."
