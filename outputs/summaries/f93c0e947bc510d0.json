  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of domestic assault in the second degree.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, Missouri, alleges that on October 26, 2017, a jury found Damon Marley guilty of second-degree domestic assault.  According to the complaint, the jury deliberated for less than an hour before finding Marley liable for the felony.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Marley was falsely told that he had just got out of prison when, in reality, he was in a continuing social relationship with a man who had been \"in our facility.\"  The complaint further alleges that B.P. and Marley were in a \"continuing social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature\" at the time of the alleged assault, and that Marley had \"just got out\" when he confronted her about her relationship with her father.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the jury found Marley with a history of domestic violence, including a felony conviction for domestic battery in the first degree, a felony for which he was sentenced to six and a half years in the department of corrections, and a civil injunctive action.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the complaint against Marley, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Marley from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Marley to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Marley also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including in the purchase, sale, or promotion of a security deposit.  Finally, the Court agreed to send a copy of the Complaint to the court for further determination by the court upon motion of the SEC.  On March 2, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Jackson County, Missouri alleging that, in a parallel action, the trial court violated Section 5 of the federal securities laws by failing to provide sufficient evidence to determine whether a defendant was a \"domestic victim\" under the current and previous federal laws.  It also found that, contrary to representations made to the jury, the defendant did not have the ability to breathe during the alleged attack.  Among other things, the Commission found that the defendant had \"choked,\" \"almost fainted,\" and \"almost got out.\"  In a related action,"
