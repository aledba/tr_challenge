  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a child custody modification case against him.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, alleges that the trial court improperly relied upon the 2014 Judgment as a basis for modifying custody for a minor child.  According to the complaint, the court found that Mother failed to demonstrate a willingness to co-parent and obtain Father\u2019s input on legal custody decisions when it found that Father had abused Daughter.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Mother delayed obtaining custody of Daughter for five or six months, despite repeated requests by Father to do so, despite the court finding that the new Judgment was insufficient to support a custody modification.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of the 2018 Modification Judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating Section 452.410 of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay periodic child support and expenses for Daughter and to provide additional math tutoring for Daughter. The court also ordered Mother to provide Father with a phone and an additional computer to play games and to attend events at school.   The complaint further alleges that, in the course of the litigation, the defendants failed to provide sufficient evidence to support the finding of a substantial change in circumstance that would warrant a modification in custody.  As a result of the defendants\u2019 delay in obtaining custody, Mother has been barred by the court from making any reasonable determination as to whether a modification of custody is in the best interests of the child or her custodian.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court of Common Pleas granted the SEC the right to request a temporary restraining order against Father from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (\"Advisers\"), and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Separately, the SEC is seeking an order to bar Father from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, including securities in the securities industry, and to bar him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services."
