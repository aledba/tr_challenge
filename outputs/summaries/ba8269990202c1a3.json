  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against Marroquin Ambriz, a Mexican citizen, alleging that he was unlawfully held in the United States without a bond hearing.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Yuba City, California, alleges that, from at least September 2016 through June 2018, Marroququin Ambri was held without bond because he was a risk to the community.  According to the complaint, the court found that, based on the length of his detention, he was not eligible for bond because the bond hearing was not conducted using the correct burden of proof.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court did not consider that the amount of time he had been detained was sufficient to warrant a second bond hearing, and that, as a result of his prolonged detention, the government would not be able to provide him with an additional bond hearing if it did not deem reasonable to do so.  Additionally, the SEC alleges that a federal district court in San Diego, California issued a temporary restraining order halting the issuance of a bond and ordering the government to provide an accounting of the amount and nature of the bond.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Mexican citizen consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a $1,000,000 officer-and-director bar.  Separately, the Department of Homeland Security announced that it had obtained an emergency court order temporarily freezing the assets of several Mexican citizens in connection with a pending immigration case.  On July 24, 2019, the Honorable Amy C. McKinley of the U. S. District Court for the Central District of California granted the court's order temporarily restraining the issuance, issuance, or destruction of any documents related to the case, including the names of the individuals who were charged with the alleged violations of the federal securities laws.  McKinley also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency and to pay a $100,000 civil penalty in the event of a court order requiring him to comply with the court order.  Among other things, McKinley agreed to the appointment of a receiver to facilitate the repatriation of the illegal aliens.   The court also granted the government's request for a writ of habeas corpus, which is subject to court approval. "
