  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered an emergency custody and dependency-neglect order against Melanie Blasingame and her husband, Robert Brumley, for failing to comply with a court order to remove the children from Melanie's custody.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 4, 2015, Melanie and Daniel were placed in the custody of the Arkansas Department of Human Services (DHS) for the purpose of reunification. The complaint alleges that Melanie had been in the home with Daniel since December 2017 when she obtained an order of protection against him from the agency, and that Daniel had spent the night on several occasions, helped Melanie install a wood stove, treat the children's hair for head lice, and helped move the family to their current home.  The complaint further alleges that Daniel was a \"bully\" and \"stalked\" her wherever she went, and failed to adequately supervise the children.  In addition, according to the complaint, Daniel had been arrested three times in the course of the case and spent approximately seventeen months in custody of Melanie, despite having been placed in DHS custody for the second time in January 2018.  As alleged in the complaint filed in federal court in New York, Melanie has been permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, Melanie consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and requires her to submit to drug screens as requested by the court.  Daniel also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years.  Melanie has agreed to settle the charges against her by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction that prohibits her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service, including the right to reapply for a court-ordered officer-and-director bar at any time.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Smith Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Arkansas Attorney General's Office in this matter."
