  "summary": "The Board of Retirement of Fresno County Employees' Retirement Association today announced that it has issued a final judgment against a former deputy sheriff who had two surgeries on his right knee.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Thomas Alberda, a former Fresno County deputy sheriff, had two knee operations in 1981 and a 2003 assignment to a small squad car.  The complaint alleges that, in one of the operations, he hyper-extended his right leg while on duty, causing an internal derangement that required surgery.  As alleged in the complaint, the surgery did not result in a permanent incapacity, and the injury to the right knee did not contribute substantially to his disability.  In a parallel action, the California Department of Health and Human Services today issued an order denying AlBERda's request for a service-connected disability retirement.  On May 4, 2010, the court granted Alberd's request to a hearing officer to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to determine that the 1995 injury and the 2003 assignment were related.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  At the hearing, the hearing officer also agreed that the commission's finding was contrary to the weight of the evidence presented by both sides in the administrative hearing.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Andrew Birkenheier of the San Diego Regional Office, and is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
