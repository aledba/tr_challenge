  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boise, Idaho, alleges that the defendant, Jeffrey McKinnie, filed a motion for restitution on behalf of a crime victim, who was not a party to the criminal case and had no standing to file a restitution motion.  According to the complaint, McKinnie filed the motion after learning that a court had jurisdiction to order restitution for the purpose of finding the defendant liable for the victim\u2019s economic loss, and that the court had the right to determine the amount of restitution owed to the victim.  McKinnie also allegedly failed to include Johnson or his counsel on the motion. The complaint further alleges that McKinnie failed to inform the victim that he had signed a civil settlement that released Johnson from any additional financial responsibility.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against McKinnie.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Mascianica of the Federal Bureau of Investigation entered a restitution order for $101,665.64, which was paid by Johnson's insurance company. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered McKinnie to prepare the restitution order, and appointed a public defender to represent the victim in the restitution proceeding.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2018 was delayed by an hour because of the court's decision to defer to the trial court for a hearing on the matter of restitution.
