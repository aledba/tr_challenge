  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Sears Home Improvement Products, Inc., a Texas-based flooring company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that, from approximately April 2014 through approximately May 2014, Sears and Toth engaged in an independent contractor agreement under which Toth agreed to provide flooring services and/or to install flooring merchandise on Sears' behalf. According to the complaint, Toth allegedly engaged in a personal business transaction with Langham, soliciting the purchase of Bostik, a membrane sealant designed to reduce moisture in the flooring. The complaint further alleges that Toth provided Sears with a copy of a marketing brochure that he had received from a Sears flooring customer. The SEC alleges that Sears failed to show sufficient prima facie evidence to support its breach of contract claim. In addition, the complaint alleges that in its response to Toth\u2019s motion to dismiss, Sears consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Sears from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The court also granted Sears\u2019 motion to restate its prior judgments against Toth.  In its order, the court also ordered Sears to pay civil penalties of $250,000, $50,000 and $100,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a $75,000 civil penalty. The final judgment also orders Toth to pay $1.5 million in restitution, $20,000 of which will be deemed satisfied by a jury trial ordered by the court upon motion by the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Sears agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions. The judgment also prohibits Toth from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or promotion of any product or service that is not authorized by the company or the federal district court for the Southern District of New York. In a parallel action, the Texas Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver. The receiver has agreed to the appointment of a receiver that will determine the amount of any civil penalty and to pay the receiver a $25,000 penalty.\u00c2\u00a0 The receiver also agreed to pay an $8,500 civil penalty"
