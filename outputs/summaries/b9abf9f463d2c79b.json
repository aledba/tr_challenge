  "summary": "On May 6, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Appellee Jeanne Martin, a Youngstown, Ohio resident who filed a complaint in small claims court in 2015 alleging that her neighbor violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Youngstown in 2015, Appelllee filed a motion for summary judgment on August 6, 2015, alleging that Appellant's fence had been removed after it was determined that it encroached on her property, interfered with her ability to repair her sewer line, and that Appelant engaged in acts of harassment against her.  The complaint alleges that, in a parallel action, the trial court granted the motion to strike, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, without requiring the court to determine whether the motion was properly filed or served.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued a temporary restraining order halting the motion for the summary judgment.  On May 9, 2016 Appellee filed an answer and counterclaim, which was filed with the court on the same day as the response to the motion.  Appellante also allegedly filed a second complaint, this time against the defendant, charging him with violating Section 5(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b-3 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c).  The SEC's order, which entered the final judgment on the second day of May 2016, requires that Appellelee respond to the court's order by filing a second and third assignment of error, which is required by the federal securities laws, on the date of the judgment. The court will determine whether to impose a civil penalty based on the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC. The SEC also requires Appellance to comply with the entry of a judgment that imposes a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities laws.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5(B)(2) and Litigation Bulletin No. 17-cv-01-17."
