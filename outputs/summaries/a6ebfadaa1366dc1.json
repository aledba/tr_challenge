  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment in favor of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission against Medicine Park Telephone Company, an Oklahoma-based telecommunications provider.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Medicine Park received a $1.046 million OUSF reimbursement in 2014 for costs incurred to relocate its telephone facilities as required by the city of Oklahoma City for a street-widening project.  The complaint alleges that the Commission improperly excluded certain of these expenses from the request for funding, including expenses that were not related to primary universal services, and that the company did not first seek alternative funding or substantiate the reasonableness and necessity of its request.  In its order, the Commission ruled that Medicine Park was entitled to a lump-sum payment of $309,016.90 for calendar year 2014 and a monthly recurring amount of $25,751.41, payable beginning January 1, 2015.  On May 31, 2016, the Court of Civil Appeals granted the Commission's request for a partial injunction and ordered Medicine Park to pay a civil penalty of $1,046,188.00, which is equal to the amount of the company's requested funding.  Medicine Park has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal and state laws, and orders it to pay civil penalties of $2,500.00 and $3,500, respectively.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC has also agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay an officer and director bar and a penny stock bar and officer-and-director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Scott Frost and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Frost and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oklahoma Department of Insurance, and the Oklahoma Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
