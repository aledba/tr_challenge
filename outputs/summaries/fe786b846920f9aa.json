  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former bowl sponsor, Aloha Sports, Inc., for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Hawaii, alleges that Aloha, through its subsidiary, Pro Sports & Entertainment, Inc. (\"Pro Sports\"), falsely claimed that the NCAA had legitimate business reasons not to certify the 2003 Seattle Bowl, and that it had a legitimate business interest in the bowl game. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the SEC's representations, the complaint failed to show that the complaint was materially inconsistent with the facts presented in the complaint.  In addition, the SEC alleges that as a result of Aloha's alleged conduct, it was unable to proceed on its bid for the Seattle Bowl because it had failed to timely submit a letter of credit to the NCAA and to make outstanding payments to participating teams and vendors.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Aloha also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or promotion of any bowl game, and to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $2,031,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On January 24, 2018, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered Aloha to comply with the court's order.  According to the order, filed on January 12, 2012, the final judgment entered against Aloha on the merits of the case against the SEC against the company, which was previously enjoined by the same court from violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") or Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the company to pay an $8,000 civil penalty and a $1 million civil penalty.  It also ordered the payment of a $500,000 penalty in a parallel action.  Among other things, the settlement was subject to approval by the Court of Appeals for the District of Hawaii, which granted the SEC summary judgment against the defendants on the basis of its finding that the defendants violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act.   The court also issued a preliminary injunction against the Defendants from violating Section 13(e) of Exchange Act Rule 13b-20 and Rule 13e-3, ordering the defendants to disgorge"
