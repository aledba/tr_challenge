  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc. (Shimadzu), under the forum selection clause in the parties\u2019 contract.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants\u2019 assets, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in federal court in Orange County, California on November 21, 2017, Shimadzak violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC alleges that, in violation of Section 418.10 of the federal securities laws, the defendants were entitled to renew after remand from federal court an earlier forum non conveniens motion the state trial court originally denied. The complaint also alleges that the defendants failed to adequately disclose to the trial court that they had lost the value of the property in the property and that they could not afford to rent a second LCMS 8040 or similar equipment to UBL. Finally, the court granted the defendants the right to reapply after five years, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged misconduct.  On November 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against the Defendants, and a penny stock bar against each of the Defendants.
