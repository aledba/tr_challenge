  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of two felony counts of felonious assault.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Aristotle Zarkin was the victim of an altercation between himself and a woman at a birthday party.  According to the complaint, Zarkin confronted defendant after Zarkin told him that she had fallen on a piece of glass and that defendant had hit her with a knife.  Zarkin allegedly replied that he had checked whether glass or other particles were present in the wound to make sure that no particles were left behind to cause further injury and that he did not throw a \"normal\" punch with his knuckles \"straight to whatever body part he was hitting.\"  The complaint also alleges that defendant did not use a roundhouse punch as described in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Zarkin, who was later sentenced to prison terms of 5 to 10 years and two to four years.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $1,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Mary Beth Kelly and supervised by Eric R. Kowalski. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the New York Police Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the New Jersey State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
