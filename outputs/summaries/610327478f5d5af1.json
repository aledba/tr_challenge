  "summary": "On April 27, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a final judgment against defendants Brooklyn Transfer LLC, Nino Tristani, Anthony Tristani and GPB Waste NY LLC in a civil rights action brought by Cleanup North Brooklyn, a grassroots community organization that seeks to restore the health of North Brooklyn.  The court found that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, defendants overcharged for services that should instead have been performed by attorneys, including drafting and serving motion papers.  As alleged in the complaint, defendants charged $66,503.15 in attorneys' fees and $9,426.24 in costs, for a total of $137,567.49 for 351.35 hours of legal work.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their attorney's fees.  In addition, the court granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Jennifer Chantrasekhar. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Office of Inspector General. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Brooklyn, N.Y., alleging that defendants misappropriated and misused millions of dollars of investor funds for personal expenses, including attorney fees, for the purpose of recovering investor funds.
