  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the California Department of Water Resources (CalWR) in a related action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, California, alleges that the CalWR violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that CalWR failed to adequately consider the impact of global warming on the state's water supply, flood management, and other requirements for the project. CalWR has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins CalWR from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million. The settlement is subject to court approval. The court also ordered CalWR to comply with the requirements of Section 401 of the federal Clean Water Act and Rule 50b2-3 thereunder, and to provide for an accounting of CalWR's obligations under Section 401. The SEC also agreed to pay an $8 million civil penalty to CalWR. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against CalWR and CalWR in connection with the same action. The case is being handled by Jennifer C. Barry and Eric R. Werner of the SEC's San Francisco office.
