  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment in favor of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission against Dobson Telephone Company (Dobson).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, alleges that, in 1996, the Commission improperly denied a request for reimbursement from Dobson for costs incurred to relocate its telephone facilities as required by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT) for a street-widening project.  According to the complaint, Dobson sought reimbursement under Subsection (K)(1)(b) of the OUSF, which seeks to provide primary universal telephone service to customers in rural, insular, and high-cost areas of Oklahoma.  The complaint alleges that Dobson failed to prove that the expenditures at issue were necessary for providing primary universal services to all customers.  In addition, the complaint alleged that, based on the Commission's findings, the amount of Dobson's requested reimbursement was not sufficiently supported by evidence as the confidential information reviewed by its Administrator was not included in the record before the Commission.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's action, the SEC consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, orders Dobson to pay a $54,766.71 civil penalty, and orders the Commission to pay $265.83 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $1,038. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-2016.  On May 9, 2017, the Honorable Judge David J. Burt of the U. S. District court for the Eastern District of Okla. issued an order suspending the suspension of the suspension pending final approval by the court. The order also ordered the SEC to conduct an in-depth review of the application and to determine whether the Commission has regularly pursued its authority, and whether the findings and conclusions of the Commission are sustained by the law and substantial evidence. The Commission's investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center, and the litigation will be led by David Burt and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oklahoma Secretary of State's Office and the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone submitting an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov."
