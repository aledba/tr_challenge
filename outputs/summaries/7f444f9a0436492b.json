  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against a Bismarck, Minnesota-based real estate association and its founder, Lonnie Barth, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Columbia, Barth and his company, The Ridge at Hawktree Homeowners' Association, raised the issue of whether or not to impose a civil injunctive action against Barth.  The complaint alleges that Barth violated Section 5, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he violated Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Ceynars consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 15a-1 of the Exchange Act, and orders Barth to pay disgorgement of $140,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $50,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Barth arising from the same conduct.   The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutability.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Minnesota Department of Commerce, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in this matter."
