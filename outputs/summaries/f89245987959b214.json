  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against a defendant and two companies he controlled, ordering them to pay $1.325 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Greenwich, Connecticut, alleges that Murray Chodos, the former president and managing member of Seven Oaks Enterprises, L.P., and Seven Oaks Management Corporation (SOM), violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that the defendants failed to adequately consider the nature of the alleged violations, and that the court improperly instructed the defendant to assign the note to SOM.  According to the complaint, the defendants did not produce the note at trial, there was insufficient evidence that the note was lost, and the plaintiffs did not have the right to enforce the note.  In denying the defendants' motion for judgment, the court also ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,325 million.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains, and orders the parties to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On August 21, 2015, the Honorable Judge Robert A. Hannan of the U. S. District court for the Southern District of New York granted the Defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The Court also granted the defendants the ability to apply for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The court's order also prohibits the defendants from acting as unregistered brokers or agents of any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal bankruptcy court, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 23, 2015)."
