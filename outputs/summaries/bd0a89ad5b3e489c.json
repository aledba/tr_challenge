  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Mexican citizen for his role in a drug-distribution ring.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that on March 4, 2019, a federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a penalty of 20 years to life.  According to the complaint, the court-appointed interpreters misappropriated the testimony of a key government witness, who was a co-defendant in the alleged Code Red drug distribution ring. The complaint alleges that Pineda-Hernandez was the source of the drug, and that he provided the drug to Barragan-Lopez. The SEC alleges that the judge misused her discretion by not requiring the interpreter to interpret the testimony. Instead, the judge simply asked the interpreter if he could \"tell the funny thing called the truth\" and \"do as you deem fit.\"  The judge agreed.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and imposing a five-year mandatory minimum for each defendant.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for New Jersey today filed criminal charges in the case.  On March 5, 2019 the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Barragan Lopez, charging him with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933, and ordering the judge to order him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and pay a $500,000 civil penalty.  A hearing on March 6, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. EST.  Judge Gonzalo P. Currid of the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana entered a judgment against Currid, ordering Currid to pay disgorgement of $2,065, and a $1 million civil penalty, ordering that Currid be enjoined from associating with any person with a criminal conviction for a prior felony, imposing a 5-year penalty, and appointing a federally certified interpreter to provide interpretation services for the witness.  Currid agreed to the judgment and agreed to be permanently barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney"
