  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against Shannon Drake, a Greenville, South Carolina, bank employee accused of orchestrating a bank fraud and tax fraud scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Drake was falsely told by the bank's counsel that she was not a target nor a subject of the investigation, and that the bank was subpoenaed to appear and produce records to a grand jury as part of an investigation.  According to the complaint, Drake's attorney, Jim Medford, told her that he would meet with her and her attorney and \"ask her if she had any questions about her status.\"  The complaint further alleges that Medford told Drake that he had \"no problem\" with Drake's status as a target and that he \"would help to get her an attorney of her own.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for North Carolina announced that it had obtained a subpoena to the bank for documents related to Drake's alleged role in the bank fraud.  Drake agreed to the subpoena without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In its judgment, the court found that Drake violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and the broker-dealer registration provision of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  It also found that, in violation of Section 17(a)(1) of The Securities Act of 1933, Drake violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 12b-20 thereunder of the Exchange Act and Section 15a-3 thereunder; and that, as a result of the foregoing, Drake has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty equal to the amount of her penalty.   The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Drake from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with a criminal case. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Andrew M. Torcasio and Mark L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the U."
