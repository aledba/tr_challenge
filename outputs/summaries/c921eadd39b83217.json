  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Canyon View Limited, a mobilehome park owner, in which it agreed to settle charges that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Canyon View sought to quiet title to four mobilehomes located in Canyon View Estates, California.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of Canyon View purchasing the mobilehome on lot 213, it was not entitled to a right to free and clear title under the MRL, and that Canyon View failed to timely respond to the court\u2019s orders denying the defendants\u2019 requests for attorney fees and costs.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to adequately disclose to Canyon View that they held a beneficial interest in the property when it purchased it.  Canyon View also failed to comply with court orders requiring it to pay $17,851.72 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering Canyon View to pay a $20,000 civil penalty, and imposing a $10,000 bar on Canyon View.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed an enforcement action in July 2016 against Caliber Home Loans, LLC (Caliber) and HSBC Mortgage Services, Inc. (HSBC) for violations of the anti-fraud provision of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1.  To learn more about this matter, see Investor Alert.gov/InvestorSecurities."
