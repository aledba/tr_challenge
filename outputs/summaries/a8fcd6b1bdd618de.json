  "summary": "On March 20, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico entered a final judgment against Santa Fe County District Attorney Joe Martinez and Christopher Mavis in a civil injunctive action brought under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the court's order, Martinez, Mavis and Mavis agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico announced criminal charges against the defendants.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, charges the defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rules 5b-5, 5a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and penny stock bars against each defendant. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J.

Kasper and supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Mexican Attorney General's Office, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
