  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Social Security Administration's (SSA) denial of disability benefits.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Karen R. Price worked as an administrative assistant for the New York City Housing Authority from 1976 to 2007, as a housing assistant and later as a manager/office manager and housing manager.  The complaint alleges that Dr. Sabharwal reviewed the SSA's records and found that Plaintiff had a history of low back problems that worsened over the last three years.  As alleged in the complaint, Plaintiff had experienced back pain for the preceding five years, with the pain getting progressively worse, and she was not receiving any medical treatment for the pain.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that she had experienced severe back pain in the past five years when she was evaluated by a clinical trial physician for degenerative joint disease and osteoarthritis of the spine.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Price consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  She also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Himmlefarb of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Ms. Price and Ms. Gibson, and the case is being supervised by C.J.
