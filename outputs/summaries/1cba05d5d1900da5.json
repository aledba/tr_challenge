  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Avery Tumer and co-conspirator Timotheous Reed for their roles in a carjacking that left Christopher Gist in critical condition.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 2013, Tumer, a convicted felon, and Reed conspired to carjack Gist's car.  According to the complaint, the defendants planned to steal Gist\u2019s car in the two minutes after the attack, but Tumer decided on his own to take the car and when Tumer demanded that Gist leave the car, Gist refused to get into the car. The complaint further alleges that Tumer told the men that he would steal the car if Gist had money on him because he sold marijuana, and they planned to use the car to rob Gist.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the defendants simply did not have the evidence to show that Lanier had a plan to steal his car, and that he did not know or care about the details of the plan.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Tumer.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the court has issued a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Mascianica entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Tumer from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The court also ordered Tumer to pay $1,500 in restitution, which is a penalty equal to the amount of his criminal conviction.  Tumer agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a permanent injunction, which requires him to show cause and effect, including that he has consented to a court order, that he will pay a penalty of a total of $50,000.  He also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to a three-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 564 F.3d"
