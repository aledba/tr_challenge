  "summary": "On June 28, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil action against Glen L. Brawley, an orthodontist, alleging that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama on January 8, 2018, Kevin Forbes and Maria Rosa Forbes of Mobile, Alabama, filed an amended complaint alleging that, on April 21, 2014, Kevin agreed to be treated by Dr. Robert L.Brawley at his Alabama office for a total of $5,150. The amended complaint also alleged that, after Dr. BRAWley threatened to leave Maria Rosa's braces on even after they were ready to come off, Kevin allegedly took off the braces approximately six months early.  The SEC alleges that, in its judgment, the court found that Kevin had failed to adequately demonstrate that he had breached contract and misrepresentation, and that he could not prevail on a breach-of-contract action.  In addition, it found that, based on the facts of the case, Kevin could not prove the existence of a contract and could not have relied on any alleged misrepresentation to their detriment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Kevin consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On June 25, 2019 the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals entered a judgment against Kevin, permanently enjoining him from future violations, ordering him to comply with the court's orders, and imposing a $1.5 million civil penalty against him.   The court also issued an order suspending Kevin from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney in a case involving summary judgments against defendants in summary judgments.  To settle the SEC case, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against further violations of the charged statutes.  Kevin also agreed to a five-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, including securities in the securities of any public company, and to pay disgorgement of $3,995, prejudgment interest of $995, and a one-year officer-and-director bar against Kevin. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.
