  "summary": "On February 14, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia entered a final judgment against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for failing to timely respond to an emergency action by the agency.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charleston, West Virginia, the agency failed to respond to a court order requiring it to develop a \"reasonable and expeditious schedule\" for the development of TMDLs for streams designated biologically impaired.  The complaint alleges that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder, and that it failed to act on the agency's requests.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants had failed to perform their statutory duties by failing to adequately evaluate whether a tract of land contained wetlands.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 13a of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3, and orders them to pay attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $100,000, $50,000 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $150,000.  On August 27, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint against the agency, alleging that it had not acted on its own, failed to adequately assess the environmental impact of its actions, and failed to provide a reasonable and expedited response to the emergency action. The complaint also alleges that West Virginia filed a civil injunctive action against the company, charging it with a violation of the \"whenever appropriate\" statute. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Scott V. Scott and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Randy C. Huffman. The case is being supervised by Marc Blau. The Court appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for West Virginia and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1365(a)(2).  The SEC encourages the public to check the backgrounds of people filing a civil action by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert on Investor.gov to encourage investors to check whether their investments are subject to regulatory scrutiny. Investors can also check the background of anyone filing a complaint by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's investor.gov website to find out how to spot suspicious patterns."
