  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Hawai'i announced today that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing administrative proceeding against a former registered sex offender in the state of Washington.  The SEC's complaint, filed on May 20, 2019, alleges that, in 2011, David J. Doe, a resident of King County, Washington, pled guilty to two counts of \"communicating with a minor for immoral purposes,\" an act enumerated in paragraph 3(B) of the state's criminal registration scheme. According to the complaint, Doe was sentenced to twenty-four months of probation and due to the fact that he was less than fourteen years old at the time of the alleged conduct, he was not required to register as a sex offender. The complaint further alleges that Doe's out-of-state conviction in violation of the federal, state, and tribal registration requirements was a \"solicitation\" of a minor, a \"communication with minor\" violation, and an \"attempted sexual abuse\" violation under state law. In addition, the complaint alleges that the ICA improperly concluded that Doe had violated the federal registration requirements when it deemed him a \"sex offender\" based on his foreign conviction of a \"communicate\" with minor for an immoral purpose. The court's order, which was entered pursuant to the April 6, 2016 final judgment, permanently enjoins Doe from violating the registration provisions of Section 9.68A.090, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for the Central District of Hawaii today announced criminal charges against Doe. The SEC also announced that it filed an emergency action against Doe, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) and 14(a) of federal law, and ordering a preliminary injunction against further violations of the anti-fraud provisions. In a related administrative proceeding, the Department of the Attorney General issued a related order on May 24, 2019. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Department of Hawaii, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Hawai\u02bbi Department of Public Safety in this matter."
