  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Justin David Williams, Jr., a Utah resident who was convicted of felony criminal charges in connection with a January 10, 2018 domestic violence case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Williams made a false and misleading statement during a telephone call with his father.  According to the complaint, Williams initially objected to the admission of the entire phone call when the father confronted him about his son's alleged involvement in a domestic violence incident. The complaint further alleges that, at the outset of the call, Williams appeared at his father\u2019s motor home unexpectedly, broke down the door, and assaulted his father and brother. Williams then allegedly kicked the father out of the motor home, and the father was later treated at the hospital. The SEC alleges that the father never made this statement during the phone call.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for Utah today announced criminal charges against Williams, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar against Williams. The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and a conduct-based injunction against Williams from further violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Williams consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Salt Lake County v. Williams, 2013 UT App. 547, 547 P.3d (Utah 1995).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The case has been supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Assistant Director of the Utah Division of Criminal Justice. The litigation will be led by Timothy J. Welshhans and supervised by Amy S. Cotter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the Utah Office of Criminal Investigations."
