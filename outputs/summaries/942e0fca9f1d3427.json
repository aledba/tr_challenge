  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in a related action brought by the Lawyers' Committee for 9/11 Inquiry.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the FBI failed to adequately evaluate and report on evidence related to the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center buildings.  According to the complaint, the FBI's failure to report on the evidence did not prevent it from being used as an investigative tool.  For example, the complaint alleges that, in its 2004 report, the Commission concluded that Osama bin Laden and other Islamic extremists were responsible for the attacks.  In its final judgment, the court found that the Commission violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering the FBI to conduct an independent investigation, and imposing a $500,000 civil penalty against the defendants.  Additionally, the Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar from participating in any future federal criminal prosecutions.  On March 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued an order suspending the FBI from providing any assistance to the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, and ordering the agency to provide assistance in the investigation.   The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David A. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Cohen and Ms. McGlynn. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania."
