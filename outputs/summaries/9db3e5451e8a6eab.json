  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas today entered a final judgment in favor of Michael E. Williams, a disabled army veteran who, in a civil action filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) improperly denied him monthly benefits for a medical condition found to be related to his military service.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on February 19, 2017, Williams, who served in the Army from August 12, 1963, through July 29, 1966, was denied monthly benefits because the VA rated this injury as ten percent disabling.  The complaint alleges that, based on the VA's findings, Williams was entitled to an eighty percent disability rating, instead of the ten percent rating he has received, or $150,000.  As alleged in the complaint, Williams is not entitled to a waiver of sovereign immunity because he is not a member of the United States government and cannot be sued without the court's approval.  In a parallel action, on March 31, 2018, the U.N. District Judge for the District of Columbia entered a temporary restraining order against Wilkie, ordering him to submit an amended complaint, which was filed on March 24, 2017.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Williams consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500, and a $100,000 civil penalty.  Wilkie has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that imposes a permanent injunction, prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Williams has also agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws.  On March 30, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Williams, charging him with violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5 thereunder.  It also charged Wilkie with violating Section 13(b)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 5 and Rule 13b2-1, and with aiding and abetting Wilkie's violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael Scolaro, Jerome Stevens, and Glenn S. Gordon of the Fort Worth Regional Office."
