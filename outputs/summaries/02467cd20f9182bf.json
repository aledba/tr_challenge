  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office in favor of Jewish Community Centers Development Corporation (JCC) on its property tax refund action based on the welfare exemption set forth in Revenue and Taxation Code section 214.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, JCC was required to file a claim for and obtain an OCC before an owner and operator of a property could qualify for a welfare exemption.  The complaint alleges that JCC failed to check a certain box on claim forms filed with the county assessor.  JCC's claims were tardy and its claim forms were incomplete.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the County consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins JCC from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 214, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $71,054.13, with interest thereon at a rate of 2.14% per annum. The judgment also orders JCC to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court in the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a judgment against JCC on its behalf, permanently enjoining it from violating Section 214 and requiring it to comply with Section 9(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering it to provide for an independent examination of the property and its use. The court also ordered JCC and its operator to file claims for a tax refund under Section 254.5, which is subject to the same administrative rule as Section 214 of the Exchange Act. JCC has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
