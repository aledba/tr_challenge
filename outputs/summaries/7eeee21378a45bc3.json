  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the Michigan Liquor Control Commission (MLCC) against Greenbush Brewing Company, Michigan Cider Association, Farmhaus Cider Company, and Vander Mill, LLC.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Michigan on June 19, 2019, Greenbush and its co-owners, Anna Rafalski, Kurt Cox, and Jon Reeder, violated the federal securities laws by failing to enforce bonded transfers of wine, cider, or other fruit-based alcoholic drinks.  The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the federal law preempts the state law.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the federal laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against each of the defendants.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5362(b).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's Investor.gov website to quickly identify people selling investments using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0instant search tool.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that Greenbush, Cox, Foster, and Reeder violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction and the return of all of Greenbush's wine and cider licenses, as well as a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal and state securities laws, and an officer-and-director bar.  A hearing is scheduled for October 5, 2019.   The litigation will be led by Mr. Deloney and Ms. Reeder and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan State Attorney General's Office, and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services."
