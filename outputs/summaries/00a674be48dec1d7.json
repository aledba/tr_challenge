  "summary": "On January 22, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington entered a final judgment against B.O.J., a Washington, D.C., juvenile delinquent, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court found that, in the absence of sufficient evidence to impose a manifest injustice disposition, the court should impose a standard range disposition of 27 to 36 weeks of confinement in a Juvenile Rehabilitation Administration (JRA) facility.  According to the court's order, filed on December 13, 2016, B.o.J. pleaded guilty to two counts of third-degree theft for shoplifting from a Safeway. The court ruled that the standard range would impose a serious, and clear danger to society, and that the court could impose a \"manifest injustice disposition\" based on the severity of her recidivism and the need for treatment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against her. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Seattle, alleges that, from 2014 to 2016, the defendant violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by failing to comply with a court order and failing to appear for mandatory court hearings. The complaint also alleges that the defendant breached her plea agreement by violating the mandatory minimum sentencing provision of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The final judgments also order the defendants to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each.  On January 24, 2019, the Court of Appeals issued a preliminary injunction against the defendants from violating the charged provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(c), and 13(b)(2)(A), and ordered the defendants and their family members to pay a $75,000 civil penalty in the amount of $2,500 each. The order also imposed a $50,000 penalty for each of the defendants convicted of a felony and a $10,000 criminal penalty. The defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that imposes a permanent, and severe, injunctive, civil penalty, and a five-year officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Ms. Walker and Ms. Dunn"
