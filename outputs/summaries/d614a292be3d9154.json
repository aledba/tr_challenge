  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against Performance Team Freight Systems, Inc., a motor carrier company, and its owner, Julie Su, in an action brought by the Department of Labor Standards Enforcement.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Performance Team and Su violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Performance Team, Su, and Su agreed to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, require them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and require the parties to pay civil penalties.  Performance Team also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  As set forth in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to permanent injunctions and to the issuance of an order appointing an independent arbitrator to determine the amount of compensation owed to each of the defendants, and to pay the civil penalty in a parallel administrative proceeding.  Additionally, Defendants consented to entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c).  The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0In addition, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
