  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment against Dakota Access Pipeline Company, LLC and its owner, Mark E. Raffensperger, in an emergency action to halt the company's plans to build a $4 billion oil pipeline through Iowa.  The court found that the Dakota Access pipeline is not a public use because it does not meet the statutory requirements of the federal government.  According to the court's order, filed on June 8, 2016, the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) approved the construction of a pipeline that would carry almost exclusively natural gas from North Dakota to Illinois.  In its order, the IUB held that the pipeline was not a \"public use\" because it was not necessary to build the pipeline.  As the court further stated, the pipeline is a \"common carrier\" and does not serve the needs of the Iowa public.  For example, the court ruled that Dakota Access was not entitled to a right of eminent domain because it did not have the capacity to construct the pipeline, and that it had to be rerouted in a manner that would meet the required public use and necessity requirements.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Dakota Access has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.5 million.  On June 9, the same day the court issued its final judgment, it issued an order requiring Dakota Access to comply with the requirements of Section 5 of the iU and ordering the company to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount that the company has already paid to settle the case.  It also imposed a $25,000 civil penalty against Raffenperger.    The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Timothy J. Donahue. \u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Iowa Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
