  "summary": "On January 10, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the father of three minor daughters who had been placed in the custody of their father. The court found that the father violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay $75,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The court also ordered the father to pay a $25,000 civil penalty, which is equal to the amount of restitution that he has already paid to the agency.  According to the court's order, the father was not in compliance with the stipulation and, instead, continued to strike the children with two belts at a time because he did not understand the nature of the proceedings.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an order freezing the assets of the father, the mother, and school personnel.  On January 9, 2018, the court issued an order suspending the father from appearing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to provide depositions and testimony in the SEC's case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, as well as from participating in the issuance of any officer-and-director bar in any proceeding involving a child in need of care. The order also prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public school, from providing legal counsel, and from providing any assistance to the SEC in the event of an emergency. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges the father with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-1 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and penny stock bars against him. The complaint also charges the mother with aiding and abetting the father's violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1. The case is being handled by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. McKinley of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry.
