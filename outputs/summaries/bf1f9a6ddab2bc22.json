  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered final judgments against a Kansas company and its former CEO in a workers' compensation case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that the company and former CEO of Stormont Vail, Inc., Gary Woessner, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the company failed to disclose that Gary had marijuana metabolites in his urine when he was being treated on an emergency basis for an emergency drug test.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Gary's urine sample was taken by a lab supervisor who was performing a drug test on Gary, and that the lab supervisor, Thomas McGraw, followed Gary's instructions to remove the metabolites from the sample.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's opinion, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and require them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against them. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5a, July 17, 2018. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation was conducted by David Garetson of the SEC's Kansas Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by John Rymas. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
