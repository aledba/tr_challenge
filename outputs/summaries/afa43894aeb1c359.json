  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans today entered a final judgment in a civil injunctive action against the Sewerage and Water Board (SWB).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that the trial court erred in finding that the SWB, as the owner and custodian of the SELA project, was liable for the loss of use and quiet enjoyment of its properties.  According to the complaint, the jury found that the defendants failed to adequately consider the nature and extent of the damage to Ms. White's property.  The complaint further alleges that, contrary to the jury's findings, the defendants were not liable for any particular damage to the property. The complaint also alleges that a trial court improperly awarded the defendants reasonable attorney fees based upon the fact that the litigation was ongoing.  In its judgment, the court found the defendants liable under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay $400,000 in disgorgement, $20,051.44 in prejudgment interest, and a $145,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $500,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.  This case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, and the Office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana."
