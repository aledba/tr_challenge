  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment in favor of a Pascagoula, Mississippi, crane manufacturer, Manitowoc Cranes, under Mississippi's products liability laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi on June 25, 2014, Manitowsack, Georgia-based VT Halter Marine shipyard, operated a Model 16000 Series crawler crane. As alleged in the complaint, the crane operator failed to warn others about the dangers posed by falling counterweights and failed to adequately inform them of the risks.  The complaint alleges that, in the wake of the accident, John Williams, a mechanical engineer with a background in warnings and small-crane design, misused the crane's counterweight tray to cause the crane to tip over.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Williams.  On October 17, 2016, the Mississippi Court of Appeals granted a temporary restraining order and ordered a preliminary injunction against the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $3.4 million.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David B. Williams and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mississippi Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Office of Inspector General."
