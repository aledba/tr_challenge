  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Kenner, Louisiana man accused of orchestrating a second-degree murder and obstruction of justice.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on April 22, 2016, defendant, who was living with his live-in girlfriend, Michelle Price, went to the Kenner Police Department and reported that she and defendant had recently purchased bungee cords from a U-Haul store. According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that defendant told her that they would not find the victim because she was big and bad, and that she was \"well hidden\" by now. The complaint further alleges that defendants told her they would find her if she came out of the house and asked her to \"check the tire marks on the car,\" which she did not see. The SEC alleges that the complaint was filed in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Louisiana today entered a judgment against defendant. The court entered a temporary restraining order against defendant, ordering him to surrender his passport, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against further violations of the anti-fraud provisions. The order also prohibits defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of securities, including securities in the securities industry, or offering to purchase or sell any security in the name of a public company. In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted an investigation that was conducted by the Office of the Chief of the Criminal Division and supervised by Assistant Director of the Division of Enforcement. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson, Ms. Bordelon, and Patricia C. McKinley.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter."
