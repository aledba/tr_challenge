  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Sara R. Salcido, a California resident charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that, from at least 2012 through at least 2015, Sara R., an immigration consultant, provided non-judgmental assistance to a probation officer in obtaining a work permit and a visa for her client. The complaint further alleges that she assisted the probation officer with the application of a general search condition, which requires the probationer to provide a written contract, in English and in the client\u2019s native language, and to post a bond. According to the complaint, she never received any documentation. The court also ruled that, in violation of the federal law, a probationer cannot be made subject to an automatic search condition when he or she is not authorized to do so. The SEC also found that, as a result of the alleged violations of the anti-fraud provisions in Section 13(b)(2) and 13(a)(3) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder, that Sara R violated the preemption provisions of the Exchange Act and Rules 13b-19, 13b3-2, and 14a-13 thereunder and that she was liable for disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $9,265. The judgment also ordered Sara R to pay a $1,500 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the federal securities laws, orders her to comply with the entry-of-an-antitrust order, and orders her return to the United States. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Patricia F. O'Neil, who was also charged with aiding and abetting Sara R.'s violations of Section 12(e) of The Exchange Act, and ordered her to pay $2,500 in restitution.  Separately, the court issued an order suspending her from appearing or practicing before the Commission on the Status of Women, which is required by federal law. The order also prohibits her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any electronic device without the prior authorization of the Commission. The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by"
