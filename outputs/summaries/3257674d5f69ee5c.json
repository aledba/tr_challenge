  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Nevada today entered a final judgment in favor of the parties' motion to compel discovery of litigation funding related to high-end colocation data centers in the Las Vegas area.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Las Vegas, Nevada, alleges that Defendant unlawfully stifled competition in a bid to maintain its monopoly in high end colocation centers located within the metropolitan area through a variety of means, including reliance on exclusive-dealings agreements, threats of refusals to deal, and a campaign of disparagement of Defendant's competitors.  According to the complaint, Defendant also failed to disclose that certain non-party witnesses may be unknowingly connected to the person or entity funding Plaintiff's litigation.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to adequately disclose to potential jurors that they had a genuine dispute regarding any fees that it may collect, as an entitlement to those fees has not yet been triggered by litigation or settlement decisions.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the parties from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the parties to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amounts to be determined by the court upon motion by the parties.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-CV-8696 (D.N.D. Ill. Dec. 29, 2011).  The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction against Defendant from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, as well as an order requiring the discovery of documents related to certain of the defendants' claims or defenses.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleging that Defendant violated the anti-bias provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and (e)\u00a0of the Securities and Exchange Commission's (\"Exchange Act\") and Rules 5a-5, 5b-8, and (f)\u00a011 thereunder. The SEC is seeking an injunction against future violations"
