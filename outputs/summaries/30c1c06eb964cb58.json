  "summary": "On August 13, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama entered final judgments against Richard P. Shultz and Aetna Life Insurance Company in a civil action brought by the American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that Shultz violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Shultz agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Shultz also agreed to pay $1,744.72 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of attorney's fees he will recover.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Shultz arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC's action.  On August 16, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Aetne Life and the Welfare Plan, charging Shultz with violations of the federal securities laws, and seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, as well as an officer-and-director bar.  To settle the case, the court agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Shultz from future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and orders him to pay a $250,000 civil penalty and a $500,000 officer and director bar. The court also ordered Shultz to pay an $80,000 penalty and ordered him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, which he will pay as part of the settlement.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for August 24, 2020.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1771 (1949).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Department of Insurance, and the Alabama Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
