  "summary": "On September 27, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Rhode Island entered a final judgment in favor of the parties' motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing their assets, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Providence, Rhode Island, alleges that, on December 31, 2012, Mark Powers injured his right knee while shoveling snow during the course of his employment with the Warwick Public Schools. According to the complaint, Powers was unable to work from January 1, 2013 until April 3, 2013, when he was injured at work. The complaint further alleges that he received work-sharing benefits from the state for hours not worked, and that his \"average weekly wage\" was not included as part of the calculation of his average weekly wage before the WCC. As a result of his inability to work, the complaint alleges that Powers was not entitled to the same compensation as a full-time employee, and therefore should not be included in determining average weekly wages. The court also ruled that the amount of compensation paid to the injured worker in the case was not sufficient to determine the actual weekly wage.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Powers. The case was investigated by the SEC's Office of Inspector General, which issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Rhode Island Department of Insurance, and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
