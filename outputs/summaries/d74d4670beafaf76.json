  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against the Waymires in a civil injunctive action brought by the Texas Department of Public Health and Human Services against them.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that Charles Lee Cunningham III and his wife, Christi Lee Waymire, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that Cunningham and Lozano violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b2-3 thereunder, and that they violated the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Exchange Act Section 5(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder and Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 15a-1 thereunder of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint also alleges that the defendants violated Section 17(e)(1)(B)(3)(A)(2) and 17a-3(B) of Securities Act Section 15a, and Section 16(d) of Rule 15b2(b).  The court also denied Cunningham's motion for summary judgment, ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Cunningham.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action, charging Cunningham with violating Section 15e-1 of Exchange Advisers and Rule 16d-1, and charging LoZano with aiding and abetting Cunningham's violations of Section 13(e-3) and 13e-4 thereunder in connection with the alleged misconduct of Christi and Gary Waymire.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Cunningham consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to comply with the court's order, and imposes a civil penalty of $50,000, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the securities industry.  Cunningham also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5:"
