  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a Lake County judge who recused himself from a civil case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on February 10, 2017, Judge Joseph V. Salvi of Lake County, Illinois, was recused from the case based on his recusal.  The complaint alleges that Judge Salvi, who previously served as an Associate Judge for the County of Lake and the State of Illinois, made a recusal decision based on the nature of the conflict and recusal, and that he did not have the power to enter any substantive orders in the case. The complaint further alleges that, in a matter of weeks after learning of the recusal from the court, Judge Salv announced that he was not going to recuse himself and instead transfer the case to a different judge.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Salvi.  On February 22, 2017 the court issued an order suspending Salvi from appearing before the court for a hearing scheduled for March 3, 2017.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Salvi consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also ordered Salvi to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Jeffrey S. Braiman of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Braiman. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
