  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final consent judgments against a defendant who refused to submit to a blood test.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Jared Ladan McCarthy violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The SEC also alleges that the defendants failed to consent to a warrantless blood test, which is required by the federal securities laws. According to the complaint, Jared refused to take the blood test after he was arrested for driving under the influence in 2014. The complaint further alleges that, upon learning that the officer stopped Jared because he swerved to avoid detection, the officer did not obtain a search warrant to compel the refusal to submit. Jared's previous trial had ended in a mistrial, and the jury found him liable for a second-degree manslaughter, DUI, and driving without a license.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Jared.  On August 29, 2016, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Jared, and ordered the defendants to return to the courtroom. The court also issued an order suspending Jared from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the court order. Jared consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties of up to four years, and ordering Jared to comply with the agreed-upon settlement. The defendants also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a result of their refusal to participate in any conduct that constitutes a reasonable search and seizure. Jared agreed to a settlement where he would be permanently enjoined from appearing, practicing, or practicing as a representative of any SEC jurisdiction. The settlements are subject to Court approval."
