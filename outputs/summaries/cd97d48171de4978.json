  "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting insider trading in the securities of Conn's, Inc.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that, beginning in February 2014, Conn's and its directors made false and misleading statements about the financial condition of the company.  According to the complaint, the directors knew or were reckless in not knowing that the company's financial results were overstated and that the board did not act with sufficient confidence to approve or reject the directors' requests for a cease-and-desist order.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Directors knew or should have known that there was a substantial likelihood of material, nonpublic information being disseminated to the investing public that caused the company to make materially misleading statements in its public disclosures.  Conn's also allegedly knew or was reckless in failing to inform the Board of Directors that the directors had engaged in misconduct.  For example, the SEC alleges that Conn's directors made at least 1.3 million shares of their company's stock for over $66 million during the course of their trading.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $66,886,993.49 plus prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil penalty of $1,037, which is equal to the amount of disgorging that the defendants received as a result of the alleged trading in Conn's stock.  Additionally, the court granted a temporary restraining order against the Defendants from further violations of the federal securities laws and ordered them to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest and pay civil penalties of $100,000 each.  On May 29, 2019, the Honorable Judge Doreen L. Gibson of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted a preliminary injunction against future violations of Rule 12(b)(6) and ordered the Defendants to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  A hearing is scheduled for July 19, 2019 to consider the merits of the proposed settlement. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2"
