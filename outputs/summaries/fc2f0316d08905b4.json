  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of stealing over $1 million from a municipal water and sewer company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Kembreanna Starks, a 23-year-old African-American cashier at a convenience store, and her husband, Devoseia Goldston, were among the first defendants to be convicted of a Batson challenge. According to the complaint, Starks and Goldston were the only other defendants to have been convicted of Batson challenges. The complaint further alleges that Starks was the only African American to have ever been convicted for Batson, and that Goldston and Starks had been the only others to have participated in the scheme. The SEC alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also entered a temporary restraining order halting Starks from participating in the alleged scheme. Starks consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay disgorgement of $39,076.60, prejudgment interest of $2,234.40, and a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case was investigated by the Office of the Inspector General of Louisiana, which is investigating the matter. The litigation will be led by Mr. Bowers and Ms. Perry and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the SEC's New Orleans Regional Office. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
