  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the District Attorney's Office for Chula Vista, California.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, California, The Otay Ranch, L.P. (Otay Ranch) and Sky Communities, Inc. (Sky Communities) are the former owners of the shooting range.  The complaint alleges that the County failed to adequately prepare an administrative record for a remediation project at the former Otay Skeet and Trap Shooting Range.  As alleged in the complaint, the County did not have sufficient staff to prepare the record, and the expense of preparing the record was not reimbursed by the County.  In its judgment, the court found that the county did not comply with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) when it approved and adopted the MND and RAP without preparing an environmental impact report.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $66,638.14, prejudgment interest of $30,435.14 and a civil penalty of $7,093.14. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 9, 2013, the Court granted the parties' request for a temporary restraining order and ordered an accounting of the materials prepared for preparation of the record. The next day, the Commission issued an order freezing the assets of the defendants and ordering the payment of civil penalties of $59,545, which would be offset by attorney and paralegal time spent preparing the administrative record.  A hearing scheduled for July 12, 2013 was scheduled for the Commission on Environmental Quality and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission's order to freeze the assets and return the proceeds to the defendants is pending final approval by the court.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the San Diego Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United States Postal Inspection Service and the California Department of Insurance."
