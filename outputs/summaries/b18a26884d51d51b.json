  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Andre Hatcher, Jr., a former resident of the Oriana House Residential Reentry Center, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on April 13, 2017, Hatcher was sentenced to seventy-two months in prison without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The complaint further alleges that Hatcher had a history of violent conduct, including multiple stabbings and gunshot wounds, a physically abusive father, diagnoses for bipolar disorder and depression, attempted suicide, and an extensive substance abuse history. According to the complaint, in sentencing Hatcher for his role in the April 10 shooting, the district court relied on Hatcher\u2019s alleged involvement in the uncharged shooting, not the fact that he had been shot three days earlier. The SEC also alleges that the court improperly relied on a pre-sentence report to determine whether Hatcher should be sentenced to a sentence that was procedurally unreasonable. Hatcher has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and requires him to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any security deposit. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Hatcher.  On May 30, 2018, a federal district court in Brooklyn, N.Y., issued an order suspending Hatcher from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, ordering him to surrender his passport, and imposing a five-year officer-and-director bar against him. The court also ordered Hatcher to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $50,000 and $100,000.  Hatcher also agreed to be permanently barred from serving as an officer and director of a public company.  A hearing scheduled for October 5, 2019, was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. Eastern. The hearing was delayed until after the SEC's announcement of the sentencing. The case was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Barry and supervised by Amy C. McKinley of the New York Regional Office."
