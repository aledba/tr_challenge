According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Albuquerque, N.M., on March 1, 2003, SMP and Pack agreed to a judgment that permanently restrains the value of the property and reserves the right to apply for an inverse condemnation.  The court also granted SMP's motion for summary judgment on the other side of the issue, ordering SMP to pay $143,850 in pre-judgment interest and a civil penalty of $150,000.  SMP agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Albuquerque today announced criminal charges against Pack.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the New Mexico Office by Michael J. Klopping and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.
