  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Pennsylvania man accused of orchestrating a series of misstatements in his medical records.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Timothy L. Lillard, a Pennsylvania resident, was falsely told that he was disabled when, in fact, he was not disabled.  According to the complaint, Lillard had developed severe symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and social anxiety disorder.  Lillard's medical records show that, as a child, he had severe impairments in his ability to function as a person and as a member of a family.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Lillard frequently engaged in self-injurious behaviors, including cutting himself, drinking, and acting out of a car.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, this was not supported by substantial evidence, and Lillard continued to engage in these and other limiting behaviors even after he was diagnosed with ADHD.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Complaint or in the Commission's Order of Action, the SEC has agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000, which is equal to the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $1,000 civil penalty.  On May 24, 2016, the Commission issued an order suspending Lillard from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an adult and ordering him to submit a written opinion in which he agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from participating in any future offering of the Social Security Act, and orders him to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the Commission at a later date upon motion of the Commission.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1382c(a)(3)(A).  The Commission's investigation was conducted by David D. Goretzke and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
