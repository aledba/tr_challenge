  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arkansas today entered a final judgment in favor of Clark County, Arkansas, against AT&T Corp.  The SEC's complaint, filed on March 17, 2017, alleges that, from at least 2009 through at least 2013, Clark County and the putative class members were subject to improper and unlawful fees collected from AT &T and Clark County.  According to the complaint, in 2010, when Clark County signed up for service, it was required to provide an arbitration agreement with an exemption from the mandatory arbitration provisions of the federal securities laws.  In its complaint, the complaint alleges that in 2013, when the services were de-tariffed and subject to the BSA, AT & T issued a notice to Clark County stating that it would not impose any arbitration provision on the parties.   The complaint also alleges that AT& T failed to provide any satisfactory explanation for the fees that Clark County had collected, and that it never agreed to arbitrate any claims with the Commission.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Arkansas Secretary of State's Office, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, and the Arkansas Attorney General's Office in this matter.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (March 17, 2013)."
