  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a company accused of defrauding car repair customers.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Access Corp. (\"Access\"), a New Hampshire-based car repair company, leased a vehicle lift and alignment rack for a term of 60 months at $1046.30 a month.  According to the complaint, plaintiff alleges that the equipment did not work as it should, in that it takes several attempts before the equipment aligns properly, and sometimes that does not even get the job done.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant sent counterfeit bearings to plaintiff's vehicle, which were then incorporated into vehicles sold to consumers.  As the complaint further alleges, the equipment is leased and censed \"as part of a contract\" and the manufacturer and/or licensor is liable for the alleged fraud.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Access has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5443, 2009, at *6. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
