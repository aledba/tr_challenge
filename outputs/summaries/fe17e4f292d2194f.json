  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered final judgments against Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (DOJFS) and Small World Early Childhood Center for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that, in 2015, Small World was improperly in possession of Ohio Electronic Child Care (ECC) swipe cards and that staff was using the cards to check children into the center when they were not actually in attendance.  According to the complaint, in 2016, ODJFS issued an order suspending or terminating a contract for publicly funded child care.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Small World for its role in the alleged scheme.  On May 21, 2016, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and ordered Small World to pay a civil penalty of $442,963.67.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the department of job and family services agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the department from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders the department to conduct an administrative review of the matter.  Small World also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil monetary penalty, and a penny stock bar.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5104.12 (B)(1).
