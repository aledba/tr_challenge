  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona today entered a final judgment against Jarrad Barnes, Jr., a convicted felon, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, alleges that, in May 2016, Barnes was convicted of a series of felony charges, including manslaughter, based on a prior conviction by a jury that had not yet concluded that the defendant had committed a serious felony.  According to the complaint, the jury was instructed on dangerousness during the guilt phase of the trial, even though the jury had not been instructed on the dangerousness allegation at the time.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the jury deliberated for less than an hour before it was called upon to determine whether to discharge the defendant.  As a result of the jury's deliberation, the defendant was not subject to mandatory dismissal.  Instead, the court instructed the jury to ask the jury for a second jury, which was not required by the court.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Barnes consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The judgment also prohibits Barnes from participating in any jury-registration scheme, and prohibits him from participating as a member of a jury.  For further information, see Arizona v. McCreary, 206 Ariz. 534, 567 P.2d, and Utah v. McShane, 565 P.3d, 206 A.D.&nbsp; The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Arizona Department of Justice in this matter, the Arizona Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Arizona Bureau of Criminal Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
