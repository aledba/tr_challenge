  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Alliantgroup, L.P., a California-based specialty tax consulting firm, and its California counterpart, AlliantGroup, LLC.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Harris County, Texas, alleges that, in October 2007, California state district court Judge John R. Wimsatt issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to comply with the court's order.  According to the complaint, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that enforcing the forum selection clause would not diminish Verdugo's unwaivable statutory rights under the federal securities laws.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court did not determine whether to impose a civil penalty against the defendants.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants failed to show that enforcing a forum selection and choice-of-law clause would be unreasonable or unfair.  Instead, the SEC alleges that defendants violated Sections 219 and 1194 of the Exchange Act, and the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and attorney fees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commissioned Inquiry, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000, $50,000 and $75,000 respectively, in the amounts of $20,000 each, and requires them to provide an accounting of their unpaid wages and hours of work.  Finally, the Court of Appeals for the Southern District of Texas granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, which is pending final approval by the court.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge W.L. Gibson of the United States Court of Justice granted the Defendants' request for an emergency court order and issued an order temporarily restraining the Defendants from violating the federal, state, and local securities laws, and ordering the Defendants to pay a civil monetary penalty of $150,000.   The court also granted the parties' requests for an injunction and an attorney general's order prohibiting them from imposing civil penalties against each other. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2"
