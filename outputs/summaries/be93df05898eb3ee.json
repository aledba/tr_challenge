  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming today entered a final judgment against Doyle Eugene Gabbert, a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison in August 2016.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Appellant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, in a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the convicted felon.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that, on August 10, 2016, while on parole from a lengthy prison sentence for eight felony counts of larceny and other securities fraud, Appellante engaged in a series of reckless driving and attempted to steal a car.  Appelant allegedly told his parole agent that the police had found him at the motel, and he had to haul ass.  He also allegedly told the parole officer that, if a police officer was on the scene during the first or second confrontation, he would not have pulled the gun or fired.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 civil penalty.  On August 13, 2018, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, which is subject to court approval. The court also granted the request for a preliminary injunction, which requires the court to determine whether a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant liable for the alleged violations.  A hearing on August 19, 2018 was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Eastern.  An examination that followed the same day was conducted in the absence of a competent trial judge. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mississippi Department of Health, and the Wyoming Department of Corrections in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages the public to check the backgrounds of people who commit a crime by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Litigation Release\u00c2\u00a0to identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the FBI has issued an\u00c2\u00a0investigation\u00c2\u00a0on whether a defendant with a history of mental illness or deficiency has a reasonable capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct and conform his conduct to the requirements of the law."
