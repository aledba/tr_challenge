  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Daniel Pye, who was sentenced to 480 months in prison for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Pye violated Section 5 of the federal securities laws by failing to disclose before trial certain conversations between one of the government\u2019s agents and certain witnesses that the agent and the witness perjured themselves at trial when they denied the existence of promises for such benefits.  Pye also alleges that the district court improperly imposed a two-level enhancement for undue influence over a minor who was not yet 12 years old when he committed the offense.  According to the complaint, Pye was not a vulnerable victim and had a motive to alter their testimony in exchange for immigration benefits, but rather had a \"pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct\" with a minor under twelve years of age.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 5 and orders him to pay a $15,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Pye.  On May 29, 2015, the court issued an order suspending Pye from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to provide an accounting of his criminal history.  To determine whether Pye is a reasonable person, the SEC requested that the court consider the facts of the case before it, including whether the defendant knew or should have known that the evidence was material to the defendant's substantial rights, whether or not he had a reasonable probability that a new trial would produce a different result.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 24, 2019).  The U.N. Office of Justice and the Office of the United Nations Secretary of Justice have issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of using false testimony in connection with a scheme to manipulate the stock market.
