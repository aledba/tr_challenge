  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against Blocktree Properties, LLC, Corsair Investments WA, Cytline, LLC and Miners United, Ltd., all of Grant County, Washington, that permanently enjoins Blocktree from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the federal securities laws and orders Blocktree to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Seattle, charges Blocktree with violations of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and seeks a preliminary injunction, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Blocktree has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Blocktree agreed to a permanent injunction, to be instituted on April 1, 2019, and to be subject to a court-ordered conduct-based injunction. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 8, 2018, the District of Columbia issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order, freezing Blocktree's assets, and issuing an order appointing an independent receiver to determine whether to issue a civil injunctive relief.  According to the order, the receiver will determine the amount of interest and penalties to be imposed upon Blocktree based on his or her determination of whether to comply with the court's order.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 24-1, (Feb. 26, 2019).  The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
