  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Michael Wojcik, the husband and wife of a Chicago insurance agent, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on Dec. 6, 2016, Wojcicki and his wife, Sandra, were married in 1978. They had three children during the course of the marriage.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the divorce, the defendants agreed to pay permanent maintenance to petitioner in the amount of $13,500 per month, for a period of 60 months. The complaint also alleges that the defendants' then-minor child, who was then a student, was forever barred from seeking an extension of maintenance.  In its judgment, the court found that petitioner was entitled to maintenance in an amount that was reasonable and reasonable. The court also ordered the defendants to pay $239,400 in retroactive maintenance plus prejudgment interest on that amount.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $1,418, which is equal to disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, and orders the parties to pay civil penalties of $9 an hour, $1 per day, and $192,000 in pre-judgment interest. The settlement also prohibits the defendants from raising the issue of maintenance, and the court from imposing any monetary penalty.  On the other hand, the settlement agreement provides that the parties have the right to a court-appointed receiver to determine whether maintenance is warranted under the circumstances of the case. The defendants have agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the federal anti-manipulation laws. The final judgment also orders the Defendants to pay, on a joint and several basis, a civil monetary penalty equal to the amount owed to them by the court in the civil proceeding. The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (2014).
