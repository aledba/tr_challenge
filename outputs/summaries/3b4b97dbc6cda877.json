  "summary": "On October 24, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against AbilityOne, Inc., a Kentucky-based nonprofit organization that administers the AbilityOne program.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the assets of AbilityOne.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, AbilityOne violated the Administrative Procedure Act of 1940 and the Department of Defense and AbilityOne Contracting Oversight, Accountability, and Integrity (JWOD) provisions of the federal securities laws.  In addition, the complaint alleges that AbilityOne was improperly terminated and issued with a cease-and-desist letter on January 31, 2020.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a final order permanently enjoining AbilityOne from violating the JWOD and requiring it to submit a \"serious question\" sliding scale test to the Commission.  AbilityOne has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of its annual operating expenses, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The Commission's order freezes AbilityOne's assets and orders the company to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer and director bar. \u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced that it filed criminal charges against the company for its alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Dudek.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
