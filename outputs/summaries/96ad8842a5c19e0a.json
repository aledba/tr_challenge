  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon today entered a final judgment against the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) for failing to provide reasonable efforts to reunify father and son with their incarcerated parent.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that, in March 2016, the juvenile court entered a temporary restraining order against the DHS from making any reasonable efforts at reunification with a parent or father. The court found that, as a matter of law, DHS failed to make reasonable efforts toward reunifying father with his incarcerated parent, even though the court concluded otherwise and that DHS could not do anything to ameliorate the risk of harm posed to Z by father's incarceration.  According to the complaint, the court also found that DHS did not provide sufficient services or supports to assist father in making reasonable efforts, even if he was able to do so by enlisting the assistance of another caregiver to provide a safe home for Z.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.
