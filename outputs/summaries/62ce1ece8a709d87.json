  "summary": "On May 21, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia entered a final judgment against Kevin Patrick Mallory, Jr., a former CIA and DIA operative and contractor, on a motion for a new trial.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that Mallory violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he violated the scienter provision of the Exchange Act.  According to the complaint, Mallory consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  Mallory agreed to the judgment without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, and agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Virginia today announced criminal charges against Mallory.  On May 22, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any security or other security clearance.   The court also ordered Mallory to pay a $10,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Kibbe and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia Office of Inspector General, and the Virginia Department of State's Office of Criminal Investigations."
