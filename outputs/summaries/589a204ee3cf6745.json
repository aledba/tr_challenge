  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against Haider Abdulrazzak, a convicted felon who was later released from prison pursuant to a parole revocation hearing on April 21, 2017.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnehaha, Minnesota, alleges that, before being discharged from prison in 2011, Abdulrahman made a false and untimely application of what is commonly known as the prison mailbox rule, which requires a notice of appeal to be filed within thirty days of the date the court granted the Board's motion to dismiss.  According to the complaint, after the Board issued its order to revoke his parole and issued findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an amended order on April 13, 2017, the court improperly dismissed his appeal.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed a parallel criminal action against Abdulraffak.  Abdulraaffak, who is currently awaiting sentencing, has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by agreeing to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $1,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Abdulraeffak has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 15-6-6 of the Exchange Act, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  He has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $100,000 civil penalty.  On May 25, 2018, the Minnesota Court of Appeals issued an order granting Abdulraazzak a temporary restraining order, freezing his assets, and ordering him to surrender his passport.  A hearing on June 4, 2018 was conducted in the office of the state clerk of courts, and the court appointed counsel based upon his contemporaneous application for court-appointed counsel.   The court also granted Abdulrarizak a preliminary injunction, freezing the assets of the company, and requiring him to submit a prehearing brief to the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Kasper and supervised by Scott A. McKinley of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Minnesota Attorney General's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
