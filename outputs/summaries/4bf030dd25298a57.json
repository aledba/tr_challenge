  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Texas-based charter school operator Burnham Wood Charter School District for breaching the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that, in 2008, Burnham and his company, Amex Properties, LLC, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 271 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Burns and Amex agreed to the entry of a cease-and-desist order and to pay $265,542.47 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the securities laws, to pay civil penalties, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Burnham.  On March 29, 2013, the Honorable Judge William G. Donnelly of the United States District Court in Dallas granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the operation of the school.  Donnelly agreed to a permanent injunction, to be followed by a hearing on May 31, 2013 and a hearing scheduled for May 24, 2013.  Judge Donnelly also granted the parties' request for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to approval by the court.    The court also denied the defendants\u2019 requests for an emergency asset freeze and an accounting of the funds owed to the receiver. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Secretary of State\u2019s Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Office of Inspector General in this matter."
