  "summary": "On July 26, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of sexual misconduct under Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  The court found that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to register as a sex offender with the Department of Criminal Justice Services.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, the defendant, who was convicted of felony drug possession in New Jersey on December 12, 2014, admitted to using marijuana while incarcerated, and admitted to having a history of drug use.  As alleged in the complaint, however, that defendant's use of marijuana was not a significant factor in determining whether to allocate points under risk factor 11.  In addition, as alleged, defendant's prior drug use was not relevant to the risk of reoffending, and he was not in a substance abuse program at the time of the alleged crime.  For example, the complaint alleges that defendant denied having any physical or mental health issues and denied suffering from any mental health symptoms.  Instead, the court finds that a strict construction of risk factor 12 should be allocated, and upwardly departing based on defendant's current drug use would lead to an unwitting and anomalous result, not currently contemplated by the Guidelines and Commentary.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Tenaglia consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Teniglia also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public health institution.  On July 26 the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to determine the appropriate allocation of risk factors for the defendant.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the New York Office of Public Health and the Office of Inspector General's Risk Analysis and Detection Center. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Criminal Justice Department."
