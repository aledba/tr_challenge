  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California yesterday entered a final judgment against Gary Batze, Carlo Cesar and Justin Hayes, who were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, California, alleges that Batze and Cesar, who was an assistant manager at the Blackhawk/Danville stores, engaged in managerial work that included building displays and stocking shelves.  According to the complaint, Batze spent a significant amount of his time in the office, including approximately 40 percent of his work time on nonmanagerial tasks, including checking the inventory and inventory of the stores.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Cesar spent more than half his time on nonexempt tasks and did not spend as much time on managerial work as he should have.  As a result, the court found that the complaint was not supported by substantial evidence.  For example, the SEC alleges that, while Batze was performing his duties as an AM, Cesar was not performing those duties as well as those of a second AM.  Cesar also allegedly spent less than half the time working on displays, which is unusual for a manager of a large department store.   The court also found that, contrary to the SEC\u2019s findings, the defendants spent most of their time working as a manager, not as a supervisor, in the department store, where they were responsible for maintaining the department stores\u2019 books and records.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them.  Additionally, the Court granted the Defendants\u2019 requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against them from further violations of the above provisions, and ordered them to return to work immediately after the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for preliminary and permanent injunctions against further violations.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Richard J. Mascianica entered a judgment against Cesar that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and requires him to submit to a background check before he can participate in any disciplinary proceeding."
