  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California yesterday entered a temporary restraining order against a California-based company and its president from violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, California, alleges that, from at least 2002 through 2011, the Port Agent, Russell Nyborg, of Bar Pilots, Inc., of Coronado, Calif., and his predecessor, Russell Horton, of San Diego County, CA, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Horton agreed to the court's order, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Horton.  On March 26, 2012, the court granted the SEC an emergency asset freeze and ordered Horton to surrender his passport and other documents related to his duties as a Port Agent.  Horton consented to the order, which also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related documents, including the names and dates of any pilots assigned to a vessel, and from entering or leaving the vessel. The court also granted the company's request for an asset freeze, which is pending final approval by the court. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter.  For further information, see Press Release No. 17-20-11, March 24, 2012. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Office of Inspections and Examinations today announced that it has obtained a court order requiring it to order Horton to produce a copy of the pilot log for use by the Board of Port Agents.

The court granted Horton's motion for a temporary injunction, and ordered him to surrender all of his passport, which he has not yet done, and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. "
