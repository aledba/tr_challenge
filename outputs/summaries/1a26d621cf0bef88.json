  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against Steven Lavonne Morris, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced as a career offender under the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that Morris failed to show sufficient evidence to show that he was deficient in performance when he was sentenced in 2013.  According to the complaint, in 2013, Morris pleaded guilty to one felony kidnapping by deceit, and was sentenced to 304 months to life in prison.  In 2013, the court found that Virginia's abduction offense did not qualify as a crime of violence under the career offender Guideline, and instead required Morris to show, at the time of his sentencing, that his abduction conviction was not a serious risk of physical injury to another person.  Morris also failed to demonstrate that his trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance because he failed to argue that Virginia\u2019s abduction offense was a serious threat to the safety of another person, and that his counsel performed deficiently in failing to raise a sufficient basis for an effective assistance of counsel claim.  On March 16, 2018, the United States District Court in Alexandria entered a judgment against Morris that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his supervised release.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Morris consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and (e) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and imposing a $10,000 civil penalty against Morris.
