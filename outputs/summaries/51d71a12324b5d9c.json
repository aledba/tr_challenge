  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the County of Merced and the Commission for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, on October 14, 2009, the Merced County Planning Commission posted an agenda containing a brief general description of the project and a brief summary of the reasons why the Commission had not approved the project.  The agenda also included an agenda that omitted a mention of the Commission's potential approval of the MND.  As alleged in the complaint, the Commission failed to mention that it would be considering the adoption of the mitigated negative declaration (MND) at the meeting.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Commission did not consider whether or not to adopt a mitigated positive declaration (\"MND\") when it had previously denied the Commission&rsquo;s motion for a writ of mandate.&nbsp;  The complaint further alleges that, as a separate cause of action, the County failed to adequately disclose in its agenda that it had prevailed in its lawsuit under the Brown Act and that it was entitled to an award of costs and attorney fees under that provision.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On November 12, 2010, the trial court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the Defendants from violating these charged provisions, and requires the Commission to consider the merits of the case before it can proceed with a judgment imposing a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the court granted the Defendants' motion for writ of mandamus against the Commission, ordering it to provide an accounting of the costs and attorneys fees received in connection with the settlement, and ordering the County to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  Finally, the Court granted the defendants' request for an administrative injunction against future violations of the Brown and ordered the Commission and the Commissioner to comply with an order appointing a receiver for the receiver.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Los Angeles Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by David A. Kasper and Ms. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Secretary of State's Office, the California Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the California Office of Financial Regulation."
