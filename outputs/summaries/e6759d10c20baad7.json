  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against Casey Daniel Bauer, a Minnesota man who was convicted of second- and third-degree assault in 2014.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnesota, alleges that, in 2015, Bauer was sentenced to prison for second-degree criminal sexual conduct.  According to the complaint, the court improperly instructed Bauer to enter a downward dispositional departure based on the fact that he had a folding knife clipped to his right side pocket, which he opened and used to hit J.F. in the head at least three times, and that he was particularly amenable to probation because he was willing to spend a significant period of time in treatment to address significant chemical-dependency and mental-health issues.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Bauer failed to comply with the court\u2019s instructions to determine whether he should be sentenced to probation.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, Bauer violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(A) and 5(b)(5)(B).  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Bauer consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, with the right to apply for a bar against him from participating in any type of criminal proceeding.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Rebecca M. Welshhans granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Bauer.  A hearing scheduled for June 21, 2020, is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern."
