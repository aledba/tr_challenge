  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Sharon Marie Spencer and Dwayne Spencer in a matrimonial action in Richmond County, N.Y.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that, on July 18, 2012, Spencer and Spencer learned that, unbeknownst to her, the defendant sold a warehouse in Brooklyn without her consent and without her knowledge and without the consent of the court during the pendency of the action.  According to the complaint, after the judgment of divorce had been entered, the defendants' sale of the warehouse raised the spectre of being held in contempt.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the automatic orders are permanent and exist only for the purposes of enforcing the terms of the judgments.  In addition, the SEC alleges that the defendants were not entitled to a civil penalty for a violation of the automatic order, as there are other available remedies for enforcing such orders.  For example, the complaint alleged that, while the trial was pending, the plaintiff learned that the defendant had sold the warehouse for $1.6 million while the court was pending.  After paying the mortgage and other encumbrances on the warehouse, he received proceeds from the sale in the amount of $300,000, which he spent paying debts that he owed to the parties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC complaint, Spencer consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay $150,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of six months or until the court finds her liable for contempt of court.  On November 18, 2016, the New York State Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order against Spencer and ordered her to comply with the court's order.  Spencer agreed to the order and agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, including Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933, and ordered him to pay a $250,000 civil penalty.  He also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar, with the right to reapply after five years.  Finally, the court issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's assets, ordering the receiver to disgorge his or her ill-gotten gains with interest and to pay"
