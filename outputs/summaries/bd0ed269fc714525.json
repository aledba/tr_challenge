  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, on April 18, 2014, the defendant, Marquis Melia, told a friend that, if he was not in prison, he would be able to \"put [Emily] to work\" as a \"pimp,\" and \"guaranteed to please.\"  The complaint further alleges that Melia told the friend that defendant \"ran a prostitution sting right out of his apartment\" and that defendant had a \"long history of [having] sex with a woman.\"  Melia allegedly agreed to settle the case by agreeing to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty of up to forty thousand dollars.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Rhode Island announced criminal charges against Melia for her role in a scheme to facilitate the sale of unregistered securities in the stock of PetSmart, Inc., a now-defunct Rhode Island-based online pet pharmacy.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Melia consented to a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the charged provisions, ordering her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.  Melias agreed to the settlement without admitting or prohibiting her from participating in the offering of a penny stock, and agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations.  She also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to a 10-year conduct-based injunction barring her from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On May 24, 2014 the Honorable Kathleen M. Basinger of the District Court in Providence issued a temporary restraining order, ordering Melia to surrender her passport, and ordering her return to Rhode Island.  After a hearing on May 26, 2019, Basingler agreed to pay $25 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interests, and to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  A hearing scheduled for June 6, 2020, was scheduled for May 27, 2020. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David A. Cohen and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Cohen, Mr. Barry, and Mr."
