  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found liable for prejudgment interest in a criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dayton, Ohio, alleges that, on November 25, 2015, an Ohio man and his friend were charged in connection with a November 14, 2015 shooting in Youngstown, Ohio.  According to the complaint, Jason N. Heard and Jawonn Hymes agreed to settle the charges by agreeing to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Appellant also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On November 16, 2016, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the return of the defendant to the jury.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations, which is subject to court approval.   The court's order also prohibits the defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, including securities in exchange for a share of the proceeds of the sale of a security company's stock, and prohibits the prosecution from using the broker-dealer's brokerage account to purchase or sell a security deposit in the name of a company or to pay a penalty in the amount of $100,000 or more.  It also orders the defendant not to participate in the offering of a penny stock or in the sale or purchase of any security-related securities, and bars him from associating with any broker or dealer in the securities of any broker, dealer, municipal, or nationally recognized company. The SEC also seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a penalty equal to or in violation of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry in the Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Basinger and Ms. Barry."
