  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Entergy, Inc., a public utility holding company, and its subsidiary, Entergy Gulf States, Inc. (\"ETI\"), in an emergency action to halt an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to retroallocate 2007 Bandwidth Payments to various Operating Companies.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, on May 8, 2014, the Commission issued an order requiring Entergy to file a compliance filing with the Commission with respect to a 2015 FERC order that required it to allocate $120.1 million in 2007 and $30.4 million in 2008.  The Commission's order, which entered into force on June 1, 2007, required that ETI and EGSL comply with the 2015 order.  Entergy did not comply with this order, and instead split the $10.9 million Bandwidth Payment among the Operating Companies entitled to receive it.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Texas today announced criminal charges against ETI, PUCT, and TIEC, alleging that they violated Section 206 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, ETI consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, which is equal to the amount of the original $120 million payment received in 2007.  Additionally, the order requires that Entergy submit a periodic report showing that it has received a total of $41.3 million in revenue from 2007 to 2008, and that it is entitled to a share of that amount in the future.  It also requires that all of the payments be allocated according to actual production costs.  For example, in 2005, when Entergy received its first $100,000 Bandwidth payment, it was required to pay $80.948 million of that $120,1 million share in 2007, which it did not do.  This year, however, the FERC Order required ETI to submit a quarterly report showing the total amount of revenue it had received from 2007 through 2008, when it had already received $119 million.  As set forth in the order, the 2014 order required that the company pay a $50,000 penalty, and the 2015 Order required the company to pay an additional $8.6 million for the 2007 payment.   The 2015 order also required that EGI comply with all of these requirements.  EGI complied with the"
