  "summary": "On July 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Edward Darnell Rogers, Jr., a convicted rapist who was sentenced to 40 years in prison.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that Rogers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Rogers was convicted of three counts of rape in 2003 and sentenced to a total of forty years imprisonment.  Rogers also was found not guilty of four other counts of theft of property in the same year.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Rogers, who was also convicted of four counts of attempted rape.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Rogers consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Rogers agreed to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  He also agreed to be enjoined from associating with any person with a prior felony conviction for a crime of dishonesty, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock in a public offering of any penny stock.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC today announced that it has obtained an order appointing a receiver for Rogers' alleged victims, who will be named as a result of the court's order.
