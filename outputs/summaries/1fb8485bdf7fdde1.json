  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of shoplifting in 2014.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Brian Christopher Jennings entered the hobby store with the intent to steal a drone, which he claimed was worth more than $950 when he entered the store.  According to the complaint, Jennings, who lives in Mesa, Arizona, purchased the drone from a hobby store owner and used the stolen drone to trade in the drone for a car or truck.  After purchasing the drone, Jennings allegedly attempted to steal the drone and left the store with it.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Jennings was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 459 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Jennings was not required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the property taken or intended to be taken exceeded $950, and that he was not prevented from contesting his conviction on the other charges.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Jennings agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities for a period of five years, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar on Jennings.  On January 1, 2020, the court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court at a later date.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 459 (2014).  The Complaint also seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a penalty equal to or greater than the penalty imposed by the federal district court for each of the charged offenses.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Jennings."
