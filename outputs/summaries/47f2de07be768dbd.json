  "summary": "On May 10, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Moundbuilders Country Club Company, LLC, an Ohio-based company that owns and operates an 18-hole golf course and country club in Newark, Ohio.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, on May 7, 2018, the Ohio Department of Commerce (\"DOC\") obtained an appraisal of the property from an experienced, state-certified appraiser. The ODC's finding that the property was well maintained by the Hopewell culture, which had a sophisticated understanding of mathematics, geometry, and astronomy, allowed the property to be used as a private property. The court found that the ODC violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that, in its judgment, appellee violated Section 1743 of the Ohio Revised Code (\"Securities Act\") by failing to provide an adequate accounting of the value of the leasehold interest in the property.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Appellee. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Ohio Office of Inspector General (OIG) in this matter."
