  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against three foreign nationals who were denied a tax deduction for travel and living expenses incurred while working in the United States during their summer vacations.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Richard Liljeberg and Anna Zolotareva worked as housekeepers at the Roche Harbor Resort in San Juan Island, Washington, during the summer of 2012.  The complaint alleges that the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security failed to determine whether a taxpayer was entitled to a return to his or her home country when, in fact, the taxpayer was not entitled to the return of a residence.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Economic and Risk Analysis (OIEA) today announced that it has issued an order requiring all foreign students holding student visas to deduct their travel expenses when they are not required to do so.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the IRS, OIEA, and the IRS have agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and requiring them to pay a civil penalty of $1,157, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pappas and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Office of International Affairs, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), and the Swiss Citizenship and Immigration Surveillance Authority (GISSA).  The litigation will be led by Timothy J. Welshhans."
