  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was procedurally barred by the court from raising his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, Telly Swain was appointed to represent defendant in a case in which he was charged with the first-degree murder of Bennett. Swain pled guilty to felony riot and assault inflicting serious bodily injury on June 2, 2003, and was subsequently sentenced to prison for a total of 17 years. The SEC alleges that Swain, who was also charged with Bennett\u2019s murder, was unable to raise the issue because of his prior representation of Swain at the time of the hearing. The complaint further alleges that after Swain pleaded guilty to the charges, the trial court improperly concluded that he had a dual-representation conflict and that he would not have conducted the remand hearing any differently if he had not previously represented Swain. In addition, the complaint alleges that, to the extent he raised the issue at the hearing, he would have had to raise it on the merits of the case.  The SEC also alleges that defendant failed to satisfy his burden of establishing any conflict of interest when representing him at the trial.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for North Carolina announced criminal charges against Swain arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  On May 16, 2001, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Swain to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Swain consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $100,000, and a $50,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Swain agreed to the judgment and agreed to be permanently barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The court granted the request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) and (a) of\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act of 1940 and Rule\u00c2\u00a05(b)(2) thereunder.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. McCluskey and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by"
