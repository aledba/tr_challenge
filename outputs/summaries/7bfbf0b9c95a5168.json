  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Fester Sayonkon and Saddam Samaan of aggravated identity theft and conspiracy to commit bank fraud.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Paul, Minnesota, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that they aided and abetted each other in perpetrating the check-fraud scheme.  According to the complaint, the defendants generated up to six counterfeit checks per month, often opening their own bank accounts and attempting to withdraw as much cash as possible before the fraud was discovered. The complaint also alleges that they engaged in a coordinated scheme to steal millions of dollars from unsuspecting investors.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Minnesota today announced criminal charges against all three defendants, including Sesay, who has pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud, and pleaded guilty in a parallel criminal case to one of the same charges.  Sesaya has agreed to cooperate with the SEC and to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $1.4 million civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (March 21, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Minnesota Office of Financial Regulation in this matter."
