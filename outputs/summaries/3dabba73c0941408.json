  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Walt Disney World Co. (\"DISCA\") and its former CEO, Gregory Hale, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orange County, California, Baughman alleges that Disney's refusal to allow her to use a Segway at Disneyland in 2005 raised the issue of whether she has a physical impairment which causes her to rely on a power scooter or wheelchair for her mobility.  The complaint also alleges that in 2010, the owner of the company that makes Segways died when he apparently lost control of his Segway.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Disney.  As alleged in the complaint, the company's policy prohibits Segways from being used in public places, including Disneyland, and prohibits the use of two-wheeled vehicles in the parks.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Disney has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions and orders it to pay $4,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and orders the company to pay a civil penalty of $5,000.  BaughMAN also agreed to be barred from participating in the sale, purchase, offer, or promotion of any Segway, and to be permanently enjoined from associating with any person who has a disability with a company that does not permit or provide for a person with a disability.  Additionally, the court granted Disney's motion for summary judgment on the other issues raised by the SEC, including whether it has standing to bring an action for damages under the Unruh Civil Rights Act of 1940 (\"ADA\").  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Los Angeles Regional Office, and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Consumer Affairs. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Motor Vehicles, and the California Office of Consumer Education and Advocacy."
