  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered final judgments in a civil action brought by Joseph Walsh, a former chief administrative law judge of the Unemployment Insurance Appeals Bureau in Iowa, against the then-IWD director Teresa Wahlert and against the State Department of Labor.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Des Moines, Iowa, Walsh was appointed to the position of Deputy Director of the IWD on July 15, 2011. The complaint alleges that shortly after his appointment, Walsh received a letter informing him that he was no longer a merit employee and that his position would no longer be covered by the merit system. In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Walsh.  The complaint further alleges that, in an attempt to prevent the IW director and the State from unlawfully converting his position from a merit to a nonmerit position, Walsh filed a noncontract grievance and then an appeal to the Iowa Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) regarding his July 15 layoff. The SEC alleges that the complaint was filed in violation of Section 70A.28 of the federal securities laws, and that Walsh failed to exhaust all of the administrative remedies available to merit employees under Iowa Code section 70A., including the pre-judgment option.  In its judgment, the court found that Walsh was entitled to a summary judgment based on reasonable cause of action, without prejudgment interest, and without the need for a court-ordered injunction. The court also ruled that Walsh could not seek a preliminary injunction against future violations of the securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Walsh consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Iowa Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services."
