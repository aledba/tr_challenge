  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of Mid-Continent Casualty Company and Global Waste Services, LLC in a multi-million dollar civil action brought by the Texas Department of Insurance.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, Texas, on November 15, 2013, a Mack truck hit (1) a Dodge Ram, (2) a Ford F150, (3) a Honda Accord, (4) a toll plaza, and (5) a Chevrolet Silverado.  The complaint alleges that the Mack truck's driver, Joseph Williams, was driving the truck when it hit the Accord and the Accord came to rest perpendicular to the car.  As alleged in the complaint, Diggs's negligence caused the car to roll forward more than one hundred feet into the crash attenuator barrels separating two toll lanes.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Diggs.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Fort Worth Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Office of Insurance Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Texas Secretary of State's Office."
