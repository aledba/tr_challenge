  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment in favor of the condominium association, Duncan Place Owners Association, against Danze, Inc., a manufacturer of faucets that were installed in the bathrooms of a new condominium building in Seattle, Washington.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on June 26, 2012, Danze and its co-owners installed Danze water hoses in their condominiums. As alleged in the complaint, some of the defective water hose failed causing \"extensive property damage\" to the building and replacement costs.  The complaint further alleges that Danze refused to repair or replace the faucet, and the complaint alleges that Duncan Place violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the defendants agreed to the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a related administrative proceeding, the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Duncan Place. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against the company, charging it with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(d) of Exchange Act Rules 5(b)(5) and 10d-1 thereunder, and ordering the company to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The complaint also names as a relief defendant a proposed nationwide class of original consumer end-users of Danze's products with a duty to avoid product designs and construction that are unreasonably dangerous.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and other emergency relief agencies."
