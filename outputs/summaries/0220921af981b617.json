  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a Sandusky County, Ohio man who was indicted on multiple drug-related charges.  According to the court's order, on October 14, 2015, an officer stopped and questioned an individual who had attempted to sell heroin in an unregistered offering of the drug.  The officer confronted the individual and asked him to identify himself as a \"cop\" and \"officer,\" and he agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to comply with the officer's orders to stop and search the individual's car.  In a parallel action, the court also issued an order suspending the officer from appearing or practicing before the court as an impartial arbiter in the case.  On March 24, 2017, the Court entered a judgment against the defendant, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, imposing a $10,000 civil penalty, and requiring him to pay disgorgement of $1,078, which he did not pay, and to pay a civil penalty of $20,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, the defendant consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, other than for the purpose of obtaining a copy of the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Sandusky, Ohio, on March 14, 2017.   The court also granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against him from appearing, practicing, or practicing any securities in the United States, including for a period of two years, pursuant to Rule 17a-1 thereunder. The court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered the officer to surrender his passport, and ordered him to return to his home state of Ohio where he will reside for the rest of his life. The judge granted the request for the asset freeze without prejudice to the officer and director of public safety. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Mascianica of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson."
