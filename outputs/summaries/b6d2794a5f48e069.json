  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by a municipal board of education.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that, on April 25, 2013, a Trumbull-area school for children with special needs, Ashley Norris, a minor child acting through her mother and next best friend, Bonita Wiggins, was not entitled to the right to participate in the operation and management of a state-funded educational service center. Rather, the complaint alleges that the school's staff was aware that, for her safety, the minor plaintiff needed to wear a gait belt at all times. The complaint further alleged that, as a result of the defendant's negligence, the student suffered physical and emotional injuries, and that Wiggins was required to expend personal funds for her child's medical care. Finally, the court found that the defendants were not required to comply with the state's obligations as an agent of the state when performing their duties as a state agency.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Connecticut today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on September 13, 2016, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Connecticut Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants' assets, and ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 10-66a (January 30, 2017).  The court's order also prohibits the defendants from violating the federal securities laws and from participating in any action for money damages."
