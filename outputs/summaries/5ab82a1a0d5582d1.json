  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Lisa Whiteside, doing business as Lisa E. Luchtefeld, for breach of contract and conversion because defendant refused to pay plaintiff royalties arising from an oil and gas lease.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Macon County, Illinois, Whiteside and her company, Ramsey Herndon LLC, entered into a lease agreement with an operator to extract oil, gas, and mineral leases from the property. The agreement provided that the operator would retain a one-eighth interest in the oil-and-gas leases, and that the landowner would be entitled to a right to the overriding royalty interest.  The court found that defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of Securities Act of 1933. The court also ruled that defendant failed to adequately disclose to the third parties that he or she had violated the anti-fraud provision of Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their respective profits. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the court issued a temporary restraining order, which prohibits defendants from making or selling any offering of oil or gas to third parties, and ordered the payment of civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Norman R. Lipkin. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Illinois Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Michigan, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Chicago Police Department and the Illinois Office of Inspector General."
