  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against Leprino Foods Company, Inc., a Colorado-based dairy manufacturer, for breaching the duty to disclose provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver on May 4, 2013 and unsealed on May 5, 2014, Leprinos agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  In its order, the court also granted the SEC the right to seek a preliminary injunction against future violations of the securities laws, including Section 551(2)(e) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 5b2-3 thereunder.
