  "summary": "On May 4, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland entered a final judgment in favor of Nanni, a Delaware resident who suffers from post-polio syndrome and generally uses a wheelchair, that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  The court also ordered Nanni to return to the Marketplace as an \"ADA tester,\" which means that he will not be able to return as a defendant without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Nanni.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Baltimore, Nanni has encountered and will continue to encounter barriers to access at the Marketplace, including noncompliant parking spaces, curb ramps, sidewalk ramps, and ramps throughout the shopping center.  Nanni's complaint alleges that, in 2013 and 2015, he visited the Marketplace at least three or four times, during which time he encountered non-compliant spaces that prevented him from accessing the goods and services provided by the Marketplace.  During those visits, he encountered a series of non-existent parking spaces that caused him difficulty exiting and entering his vehicle because of the extra care needed to avoid a fall.  As a result, the court improperly dismissed the complaint for lack of standing to sue.  On May 5, 2017, the SEC issued an order suspending Nanni from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an ADA tester, and ordering him to comply with the court's order suspending him from appearing and practicing before it as an independent, impartial, and impartial tester.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Pypka and Ms. Gibson."
