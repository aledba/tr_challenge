  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 15 years in prison without admitting or denying his or her guilt.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that the Florida Attorney General's Office improperly imposed a downward departure from the minimum permissible sentence for a defendant who had pled not guilty to a prior felony.  According to the complaint, the court's order imposed downward departures based on remorse or failure to take responsibility for the conduct of the defendant.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Davis failed to show remorse or accept responsibility for his actions, and the court found that the defendant's lack of remorse and failure to accept responsibility constituted an impermissible factor in imposing a sentence.  As alleged, Davis was also in no different situation than other convicted felons who had to choose between maintaining their innocence at sentencing or seeking a more favorable sentence. The complaint also alleges that, in Davis's case, the defendant did not show remorse at sentencing and that his counsel performed inadequately.  Davis' sentencing was scheduled for a hearing on May 24, 2018, and a hearing scheduled for May 26, 2018.  On May 24 and 25, 2019, the Florida Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order against Davis, freezing his assets, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The court granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction, ordered a conduct-based injunction, and ordered Davis to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a trial judge. The SEC also instituted an asset freeze against Davis and ordered him to return to the United States and pay a $50,000 civil penalty.  To learn more about the asset freeze, see Litigation Release No. 559 (Dec. 2015).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Miami Regional Office.  For additional information on sentencing and other emergency relief, see Criminal Justice Reform Task Force No. 206 (2014).  In a related matter, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, the U. S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Florida Department of Health and Human Services (DOHSA)."
