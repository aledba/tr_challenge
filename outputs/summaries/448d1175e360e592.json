  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Mid Atlantic Capital Corp., a brokerage firm registered with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Mid Atlantic agreed to a judgment that permanently restrains the arbitration provisions of the federal securities laws and requires the court to determine whether a defendant has made a material error in determining the value of an arbitration award. Mid Atlantic also agreed to pay $118,560 in prejudgment interest, $26,812.82 in civil penalties, and a $1,000,000 civil penalty. The final judgment also requires Mid Atlantic to pay disgorgement, attorney\u2019s fees, and other costs in the amount of $192,768.  The SEC alleges that Mid Atlantic failed to comply with the final judgment, and that it failed to do so.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC also announced that it filed an emergency action to stop Mid Atlantic from violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 11(a). The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Misco and Ms. Bien. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and Antonin Scalia and Bryan Garner of the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Compliance in this matter."
