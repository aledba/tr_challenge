  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against Wells Fargo & Co., a New Mexico-based bank, for failing to timely file a foreclosure action against a Las Cruces, New Mexico real estate company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Albuquerque, N.M., alleges that, on October 30, 2007, Homeowners executed a note and mortgage to secure a $203,669.41 loan. According to the complaint, Bank's foreclosure action was barred by the statute of limitations for a written contract of six years pursuant to Section 37-1-3(A) applied, and because more than six years had elapsed between their default on October 4, 2008, and Bank's filing of the second foreclosure action on February 22, 2016, the limitation period was barred.

In its judgment, the court held that, in the event of a default, Bank is entitled to a six-year limitation period.

The judgment also orders Bank to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $192,768, which is equal to the amount owed by Homeowners in the first foreclosure action. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On November 17, 2011, during the pendency of Homeowners' first bankruptcy, Bank voluntarily dismissed the first action on March 20, 2012, which resulted in a discharge order entered on January 23, 2013. The court also granted Bank's request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 9 of the Exchange Act and Rule 9a-1 thereunder. The Court also granted the request for an asset freeze against Homeowners pursuant to Rule 9b2-1, and granted the bank's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Rule 9d-1 and a default judgment.  Finally, the Court granted Bank a partial asset freeze and ordered the bank to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which was to be determined by the court upon motion of the court.  As a result of the Court's order, the bank has agreed to a permanent injunction and to pay"
