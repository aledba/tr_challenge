  "summary": "On November 1, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant in a civil injunctive action brought by his girlfriend, Nicole Carter, against the other driver in the same case.  According to the court's order, on July 17, 2010, a Salem, Illinois man who was on his way home from a visit to his girlfriend had to stop at a stop sign to check the condition of her vehicles.  The court found that, contrary to what the court had concluded, plaintiff's injuries were not caused by a direct or proximate cause and effect of the accident.  In addition, the court ruled that, absent expert testimony, plaintiff was not entitled to a fair trial on the basis of the evidence presented at trial.  As alleged in the court order, the jury was not able to determine whether plaintiff was liable for the injuries or not, and the court granted the jury's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Carter consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On November 11, 2016, a federal district court in Chicago entered a judgment against Carter against her, ordering her to be barred from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney, and imposing a $1,000 civil penalty against her.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by John W. Strong and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Strong, Ms. Barry, and Mr. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Insurance, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central and Southern Districts of Illinois and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office."
