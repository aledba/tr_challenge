  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Surpass Senior Living, Inc., a nursing home managed by the company, that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, Arizona, alleges that, in April 2017, Deborah Georgianni arranged for her mother, Concetta Rizzio, to live at Mariposa Point, an assisted living facility managed by Surpass.  According to the complaint, Georgianni entered an arbitration agreement with Surpass in which she would be responsible for all arbitration costs and fees, even if she prevailed at arbitration.  She signed a retainer agreement with her attorney that provided for counsel to advance arbitration costs, under which her counsel assumed responsibility for advancing all costs.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Georgianni signed an agreement that included a cost-shifting provision that required her to pay arbitration fees in the amount of $10, 15 minutes, before she signed the contract.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Georgiani consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $20,000.  Georgiani also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The case is being handled by Rebecca Dice and Winn Sammons of the Arizona Office of Advocacy and Advocacy, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Arizona Department of Insurance, and the Arizona Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
