  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against CKR Property Management, LLC (\"CKR\"), a Texas-based real estate firm, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, Texas, alleges that, in June 2015, CKR and Longoria signed an arbitration agreement that provided for arbitration of post-expiration disputes only if those disputes arose under the agreed-upon arbitration agreement. Longoria allegedly signed the arbitration agreement before beginning her second period of employment.
