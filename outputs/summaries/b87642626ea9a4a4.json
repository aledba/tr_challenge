  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Lilli Heinrich, a widow of a former El Paso Police Department officer who was fatally shot in the line of duty while attempting to question a suspect.  The court also entered a directed judgment against Heinrich.  According to the court's order, Heinrich raised a fact issue as to whether the pension she had been receiving for seventeen years had been unilaterally reduced by The Board of Trustees of the El Paso Firemen & Policemen's Pension Fund in violation of a state law prohibiting retroactive reductions to pension benefits.  Heinrich alleges that the Board and Chief of Police did not credit her assertion and reduced her monthly payment to recover overpayments made to her husband while her son was no longer a qualified child under the pension plan.  In a parallel action, the Texas Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued an order requiring the pension fund to pay Heinrich a civil penalty equal to the amount of her husband\u2019s pension.  On October 16, 2018, the court granted the Board Members\u2019 motion for an emergency restraining order and ordered Heinrich to return her allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest to be paid to the fund.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, the board and chief of police consented to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the books and records provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) thereunder of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 17a-1 thereunder. The order also prohibits the Board from imposing any monetary penalty against the party who is liable for the alleged violations of the federal securities laws, including the right to reapply for pension funds at a reasonable and fair-minded time.  Additionally, the order requires the pension board to provide a copy of the final judgment to a court-appointed receiver, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 10A(b)(1) and Rule 13b2-3. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's complaint charges Heinrich with violating Section 10b of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement, and civil penalties against her.   The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Office of Compliance and Assessments with the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, with assistance from John Rymas, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit. The litigation will be led by Ms. Heinrich and Ms."
