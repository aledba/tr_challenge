  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the former Secretary of Labor and the former Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in a civil injunctive action brought by former federal employee Ahmad B. Nurriddin.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City on June 24, 2013, Nurridin alleges that, from 1991 to 1996, he was improperly suspended from working as an employee of the Washington District Office for the purpose of recovering from personal injury sustained while in the service of his employer.  The complaint further alleges that in one instance, after learning that his employer had suspended his benefits for a third time, he failed to timely respond to his requests for a medical examination.  In another instance, the complaint alleges that OWCP improperly terminated his benefits after he had failed to attend two scheduled medical examinations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000, $20,000 and $1,500, respectively.  Additionally, the court entered a temporary restraining order on June 26, 2013 that temporarily enjoins the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  On July 10, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the United States District Court in Manhattan entered an order granting the SEC an emergency asset freeze and freezing the defendants' assets, including the right to reapply for their pension funds. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Kasper and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.N. Secret Service, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Federal Office of Inspector General.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8151 (D.D.C. 2009).
