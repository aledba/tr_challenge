  "summary": "On April 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio entered a final judgment against a defendant in a related criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, Arizona, alleges that on April 6, 2015, C.V. overdosed on fentanyl and died on April 11, 2015.  According to the complaint, the defendant did not leave a will naming a custodian for Grandchild or Brother, and instead opted to relocate to Arizona.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Arizona announced criminal charges against the defendant for his role in the opioid epidemic.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (March 19, 2018).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Justice. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Arizona Department of Children and Family Services, and the Ohio Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
