  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana yesterday entered a final judgment against a South Bend man who was convicted of murder for the brutal beating death of Jodie Henderson in South Bend in January 2016.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on January 15, 2016, a jury found Davis-Martin guilty of second-degree murder in the Bryant Lacey murder.  According to the complaint, the jury deliberated for nearly an hour before finding Davis-martin guilty.  Davis-Martin allegedly told the jury that he had been in jail for murder and that he \"killed a fa**ot that night.\"  The complaint further alleges that Davis-MARTIN allegedly told his mother that he was going to the police station to talk to the officers because he \"had a young baby that he cared for prior to his incarceration\" and that the police wanted him to come to the station because he was \"gonna git [her] son.\"  In a parallel action, on March 22, 2017, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of Mississippi unsealed criminal charges against Davis- Martin.  On March 24, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, and ordered the jury to determine whether to proceed with the case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Davis- martin consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  In its order, the Court also ordered the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,038, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000 for each of his previous criminal convictions.   The court also granted the defendant's motion for an officer-and-director bar, which is required by the federal securities laws, to provide a copy of the court's order, including an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver and ordering the receiver to provide the receiver with an account of any telephone calls or calls that may be made to the receiver through the receiver.  Additionally, the order requires that the receiver provide a record of any phone calls that are made to a receiver, including one that was intercepted by the receiver in the receiver's possession.
