  "summary": "On March 5, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the Industrial Accident Board (IAB) denying claimant-appellant Steven Powell's (\u201cPowell\u201d) petition for workers' compensation benefits. The IAB found that Powell failed to establish that he sustained a work injury on December 11, 2016 while employed by OTAC, Inc. d/b/a Hardee's. Powell also allegedly failed to disclose that he injured his rotator cuff in a fall at Hardees. According to the IAB's final judgment, on June 5, 2018, Powell filed an emergency action against the Board, finding that it erred in denying Powell's petition because it found insufficient evidence to support its finding that Powell had suffered a work-related injury. Powell allegedly sought emergency medical treatment immediately following the alleged fall, but was unable to finish his shift because he was in too much pain. The final judgment against Powell, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Powell to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Delaware Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
