  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia today entered final judgments against West Virginia State Tax Commissioner Dale W. Steager in a case that was investigated by the SEC.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charleston, South Carolina, alleges that, in 2017, the Tax Department improperly imposed a cap on the amount of operating expenses that could be deducted from wells for ad valorem tax purposes.  According to the complaint, the tax department's calculation of the average annual industry operating expenses was based on a survey conducted in 2014, which it deemed insufficient to determine the true and actual value of wells.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the survey improperly excluded gathering, compressing, processing, and transporting expenses, thereby causing the average operating expense calculation to be under-inclusive.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Steager consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount that he will pay in the future.   The final judgment also prohibits the imposition of a \"not to exceed\" amount or \"cap\" on operating expenses, which is a matter of \"legislative grace.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Steager. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, with assistance from the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division's Analysis and Detection Center, under the supervision of John Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia Department of Revenue, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the State Corporation Commission, the Commonwealth of Virginia, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Virginia Secretary of State's Office."
