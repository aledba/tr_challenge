  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against Juan Carlos Rodriguez for his role in the September 2010 death of Maria Rodriguez.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Rodriguez was the son of a convicted felon who was also a felon.  The complaint alleges that Rodriguez was a victim of a long-running civil war that began in El Salvador.  As alleged in the complaint, Rodriguez suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suffered from severe depression and anxiety.  In addition, Rodriguez had been diagnosed with a mild intellectual disability when he was a child.  Rodriguez allegedly had difficulty recognizing signs of PTSD, such as having difficulty recognizing the signs of impairment in her ability to read or write, as well as a history of mental illness.  On the same day, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Rodriguez, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Rodriguez consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Atlanta Regional Office and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Office of Inspector General today announced that it has instituted an Office of Professional and Risk Analysis (OIEA) to detect potential conflicts of interest and to determine whether a defendant has a reasonable chance of recovering from a serious injury. The OIEA's Office has also issued an Investor Alert about potential scams targeting investors."
