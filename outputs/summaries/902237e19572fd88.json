  "summary": "On March 19, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Thomas Brown, a former Marine and convicted felon, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the federal and Illinois rape shield laws.  According to the court's order, Brown was prohibited from eliciting testimony or argument regarding the prior sexual activity of an alleged victim with whom he had had consensual sexual relations.  The court also ruled that defendant could not be permitted to introduce evidence of prior sexual activities with defendant based on his assertion of an affirmative defense of consent.  In its order, the court found that defendant failed to give timely notice of his intention to introduce this evidence and that the date, time, and place offered by defendant was \"sketchy at best.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Brown.  On March 20, 2015, a jury found Brown guilty of home invasion and criminal sexual assault, and sentenced him to six years of imprisonment and five years of supervised release.  Brown agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Chicago, and agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing for Brown is scheduled for May 21, 2017.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5/115-7 (January 2, 2017).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
