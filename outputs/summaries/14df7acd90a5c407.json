  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia today entered a final judgment in favor of the CDS Family Trust, LLC (\u201cCDS\u201d), a private company owned by Robert Sokolove, who agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s charges against him.  The SEC previously issued an order requiring defendants to show cause why they should not be entitled to just compensation in a condemnation proceeding.  In its order, the court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of just compensation due to the defendants.  According to the SEC, the defendants failed to disclose to the court that they had no expertise in valuing wetlands and that they were entitled to a fair market value based upon the value of the mitigation credits they had received.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, in addition to admitting the defendants\u2019 testimony, CDS also failed to show why it should not have been admitted in light of the testimony of one of the expert witnesses who had testified that he had planned to develop the area into a high-end golf course community and marina, not a wetlands mitigation bank.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the defendants, the Court of Appeals of the Eastern District of W.Va. today issued a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered that the defendants be barred from participating in any sales of real estate in the future.  On the same day, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Atlanta, Georgia, charging the defendants with violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and Section 15(a)(2)(A) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder of the Exchange Act and Rules 15b-20, 13a-1, and 16a-11 thereunder.  To learn more about wetlands mitigation, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1-2017 (March 20, 2012).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney\u2019S Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against each defendant for their roles in the alleged misconduct.   The case is being handled by John Rymas, Eric Werner, and Amy Gwiazda of the SEC Enforcement Division. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
