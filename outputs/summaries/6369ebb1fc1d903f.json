  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against Multimedia Holdings Corporation, doing business as KARE-TV and KARE 11, for defrauding a public figure by falsely claiming that a state vendor was being charged with theft by swindling.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnesota, on July 24, 2017, Nelson Auto Center, Inc. (\"Nelson Auto\"), a small business located hundreds of miles from the metropolitan area where defamatory statements are published, falsely claimed that Nelson Auto was overcharging Minnesota police departments for purchased vehicles.  The complaint further alleges that, in December 2016, the company began investigating whether Nelson Auto had been undercharged by the state vendor in an article published in the newspaper's business-financial section.  Nelson Auto's owner Brent Nelson and Laurel Nelson complained to KARE that the company had not been charged with a crime, and the company promptly corrected the story on its website.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in July 2017, when Nelson Auto complained that its story was false because it had never been criminally charged, KARE11 responded by correcting the story to instead state that it was a former employee of Nelson Auto who was being targeted by the newspaper.  On August 2, 2018, the court granted the complaint's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the company's assets, and ordered the company to pay a civil penalty of $1.2 million.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Corp.'s (Advisers) Rule 206(3) and (4) that require defendants to show cause and effect, including a reasonable expectation that the complaint will be filed with the court upon discovery by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019).
