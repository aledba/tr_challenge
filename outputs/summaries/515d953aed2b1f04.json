  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against Denver Public Schools District No. 1 in a civil injunctive action brought by teachers who were placed on unpaid leave in violation of both due process of law and the contracts clause of the Colorado Constitution.  The teachers' complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that the Colorado General Assembly violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the teachers\u2019 complaint, TECDA, which was passed in 1990, did not create a contractual relationship or vest nonprobationary teachers with a property interest in salary and benefits.  Rather, the teachers allege that the state legislature invoked the mutual-consent provisions of the federal law to remove hundreds of teachers from their teaching positions.  In a parallel action, the Colorado Department of Education today announced that it has obtained a court-ordered injunction against the teachers from violating the federal securities laws, and that the district has agreed to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  Without admitting or denying the teachers' allegations, the district agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   The district has also agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the same provisions.  It also ordered the district to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil monetary penalty of $100,000 and a $50,000 civil penalty, and to pay an officer and director bar and a penny stock bar.  Finally, the District agreed to settle the litigation by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations.  This settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Justus v. Colorado Teachers Association, 2014 CO 75, \u00b6&nbsp;  The District of Denver Teachers Association filed a complaint in federal district court in Colorado on May 24, 2016, alleging that the District of Columbia violated the federal contract and due process provisions of Sections 10(a) and 13(b)(5)(A) and (c) thereunder, and the district ordered it to comply with a court order requiring it to provide for a hearing and a hearing in the future.  To learn more about the district's obligations under the federal contracts, see \u00a7'22\u201363\u2013101 and \u2013102, C.R.S., \u00a7'11, 25,"
