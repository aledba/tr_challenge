  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a former Morgan Stanley financial advisor who has agreed to settle a civil injunctive action brought by his employer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Rajesh Gupta signed an employment agreement with Morgan Stanley in 2013 that required him to arbitrate employment-related disputes.  According to the complaint, the agreement required Gupta to first receive an email from Morgan Stanley informing him that it had entered into an arbitration agreement with the company.  As alleged, however, Gupta did not receive the email and did not respond to the email.  Instead, the complaint alleges, Gupta received the email through his work email account and received it only after he had agreed to the arbitration agreement and failed to opt out of the agreement.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Gupta.    The court's order against Gupta, who is charged with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Gupta consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, other than for his own personal use.  Gupta also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  Finally, the court agreed to an order requiring Gupta to comply with the terms of his employment agreement, which requires him to provide proof of his compliance with the agreed-upon terms of the contract.  Additionally, the order requires Gupta to provide a copy of the final judgment, which is subject to court approval.
