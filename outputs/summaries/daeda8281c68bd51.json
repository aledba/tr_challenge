  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Texas today announced criminal charges against a Dallas-area psychiatrist for her role in a series of alleged sexual assaults.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that Dr. Muhammad Haqqani, one of the psychiatrists who treated appellant at the Dallas Behavioral Health Hospital (DBHH) for her alleged involvement in multiple sexual assaults, told her that she was suffering severe and abnormal mental, emotional, and physical distress, was deteriorating in her ability to function independently, was being stalked by white men and white women, and had been detained for reporting she had been raped.  According to the complaint, appellant repeatedly interrupted a nurse to tell her that an electrostimulator had been implanted in her brain and she was being \"poisoned\" water at the nursing staff.  She also allegedly refused to bathe because she did not want to preserve DNA evidence of the repeated sexual assaults she had suffered.   The complaint further alleges that one of her doctors had diagnosed her with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, and attempted to induce her to take medication for her condition, but she refused to take the medication because she believed it would cause her to cause serious harm to herself or others.  In addition, the complaint alleges that appellant has been repeatedly sexually assaulted, had her nose shortened and her hair cut, and was being poisoned by a nurse while she was in the hospital.  As a result of her paranoid and delusional behavior, she has not taken any medication since she was admitted to the hospital in September 2018, and has not bathed for two months, received medical treatment with amphetamine for her ADHD, and is suffering severe, abnormal, mental, or physical distress.  On November 15, 2018, the trial court granted the request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the appointment of a second psychiatrist to administer psychoactive medication during the term of her commitment.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the second psychiatrist has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 574.034(a)(2)(C) of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against him. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Dallas Regional Office and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
