  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) and California-based Center for Medical Progress (CMP) in a civil injunctive action brought by the District Court.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California on April 24, 2015, Planned Parenthood and CMP violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that Defendants violated the non-disclosure provisions of the agreement by secretly recording attendees of the conference without their knowledge or consent, and by disseminating the recordings on the internet. The SEC alleges that defendants violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws by failing to state a reasonable expectation of privacy in their conversations at the PPFA and NAF conferences. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's San Diego Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter."
