  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against a former supervisor of the Wastewater Management Division for misconduct in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that, in 2010, James Tomlin and Robert Potter, former supervisors of the Division of Public Works, Bureau of Sanitation, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Tomlin told Pearl that he had been harassed by a supervisor at the agency, and that the supervisor had \"kept Griffin close so he could engage in oral sex\" with another man on a jet ski.  Tomlin allegedly told Pearl to \"do nothing\" and \"stay in his cubicle.\"  The complaint also alleges that Pearl was the victim of a \"catastrophic emotional and physical breakdown\" caused by his alleged harassment.  In its judgment, the court found that the amount of damages for Tomlin's alleged misconduct was excessive and that he was entitled to a penny more or [a] penny less in damages than what will match the harm he suffered.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the City of Los Angeles agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins Tomlin, Potter and Potter from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On May 15, 2017, the SEC filed an administrative complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) in December 2010, alleging that the trial court improperly imposed a $10 million civil penalty on Tomlin.
