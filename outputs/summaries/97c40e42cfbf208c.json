  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Mexican citizen who was sentenced to 168 months in prison for his role in a drug conspiracy.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that on May 2, 2015, a federal district judge in Albuquerque, N.Y., issued a temporary restraining order against Elisael Burgos-Vasquez, who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder. The court also issued an order temporarily suspending the defendant from participating in any sentencing proceedings and ordering him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  According to the complaint, the court did not determine whether the defendant was entitled to safety-valve relief under the federal sentencing guidelines, but instead imposed a 10-to-one penalty based on his non-compliance with the mandatory minimum sentencing requirements.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to be barred from serving any prison term, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar against him.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the Mexican citizen in connection with the same case.  On May 4, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the New York District Court entered a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions, ordering a permanent injunction against future violations, and imposing a $50,000 penalty.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Office of Inspector General, the U.N. Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Mexican Attorney General's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 17, 2018)."
