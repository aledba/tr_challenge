  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania company accused of defrauding investors in a natural gas pipeline condemnation case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that UGI Sunbury, LLC and its owner, David W. Beachel, Jr., violated Rule 702 of the federal securities laws by failing to adequately assess the reliability and accuracy of Shearer\u2019s expert testimony.  According to the complaint, Beachel and Beachel agreed to settle the case by agreeing to pay $254,228.39 for the value of their properties and $126,932.48 for the pre-taking value of the post-taking property.  Shearer also agreed that the price of the property should be determined by the court at a later time.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court in Philadelphia today entered final judgments against UGI and Shearer, finding that Shearer violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, UGI consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin it from violating Rule 702, and ordered it to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million.  UGI also agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which is a penalty equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, and to be subject to court approval of the final judgments.  Finally, the court granted the Landowners\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Shearer to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, a civil monetary penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 2, 2019, the UGI District Court entered a judgment against Shearer and ordered him to disgorge $1,532.39 in prejudgment interests and pay a $20,000 penalty.  It also ordered Beachel to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $75,000, respectively.   The settlement is subject to Court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
