  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against a Kentucky man who was found guilty of a string of felony charges.  According to the SEC's complaint, on November 17, 2011, Private Stephen Percival of Radcliffe, Kentucky, entered the apartment of a drug dealer he knew as Six and purchased a quantity of powder cocaine.  The complaint alleges that PerCival and Six agreed to a no-knock warrant to search the defendant\u2019s apartment.  As alleged in the complaint, the court found that Prescott failed to show sufficient evidence to show that he was entitled to a fair trial under the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, on April 28, 2016, a federal district court in Kentucky issued a judgment against Prescott, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,038, which is equal to the amount of his civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Prescott consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) and (b)(5) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The judgment also prohibits Prescott from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, other than for the purpose of obtaining a court order requiring him to show cause and effect, and prohibits him from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in a securities offering.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott M. Welshhans and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Department of Public Affairs, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kentucky Attorney General's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Feb. 28, 2014).
