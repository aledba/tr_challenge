  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Steven McDowell, Jr., a self-employed carpenter who was injured in a June 5, 2013 automobile accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that McDowell was the only person in the car who suffered serious injuries in the accident. According to the complaint, McDowell's injuries were exacerbated by the impact of the vehicle's impact on the other car, and he was unable to relate his injuries to any specific treatment. The complaint further alleges that the jury found that Mr. McDowell had a history of neck and back pain and that he had sought treatment for those injuries prior to the accident, but did not receive any significant treatment for them.  McDowell also allegedly claimed that he was very familiar with the area where the accident occurred, but that he did not see any evidence that he sustained injuries as a result of the collision.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, based upon the jury's findings, McDowell was not required to show cause and effect of his injuries, had no pre-existing degenerative disc disease, and had no interest in giving up his job or in having back surgery.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders McDowell to pay disgorgement of $8,000.00 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038.00, a civil penalty of $25,000, and a bar against McDowell from appearing before the SEC as an attorney or practicing before a jury.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Broussard and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans and the New Orleans Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
