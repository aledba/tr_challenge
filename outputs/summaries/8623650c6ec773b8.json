  "summary": "On May 1, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont entered a final judgment against a Vermont resident who filed a petition to modify the guardianship of a developmentally disabled adult with developmental disabilities.  The court ruled that a person with a \"direct interest in the well-being and welfare of the person alleged to be incapacitated\" had standing to petition for a change of guardianship.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Burlington, Vermont, the case arose from a similar case in which a member of a family who had been removed in 2015 after being substantiated for financial exploitation of a developmental disabled person had standing as an \"interested person\" in the subject of a guardianship proceeding.  In this case, the court found that the person who filed the petition had standing, and that the family member who had filed the complaint did not have standing to file a complaint.  As alleged in the complaint, the family friend who filed it was C.H.'s godmother and had been friends with her mother since birth.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and a $50,000 civil penalty.  On May 2, 2017 the court granted the request for a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered her to surrender her assets and return them to her family.  A hearing on May 4, 2017 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Vermont Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Vermont Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
