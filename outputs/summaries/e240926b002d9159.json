  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the parents' motion for a temporary restraining order and the return of their son, Marquis H., to his parents.  The court's order, which was entered on September 5, 2012, permanently enjoins the parents from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Marquis to be returned to his mother, L.M. and T.S., who were also in their custody.  In its order, the court held that the parents violated Section 300 of the federal securities laws, and that Marquis and his mother violated Section 355.1, which provides for the exercise of jurisdiction in situations where the parent or guardian is at risk of serious physical harm.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the parents consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 300, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also ordered Marquis's mother to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, the defendants' actions were reprehensible and inconsistent with their role as stand-in parents for those children.  As a result of the court's finding, the two parents have been removed from the home and their children have been placed in the care of the agency. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kristin B. Davis and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the San Diego Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer Davis. The case is being supervised by Lara S. Bendell. The hearing will be conducted by Christopher R. Kerstetter. The examination that led to the decision was conducted in the office of a San Diego County district attorney. The matter was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The exam that led the way to the judgment was conducted under the supervision of Jennifer Davis, a pediatrician with Rady Children's Hospital. The final judgment orders the release of the children in the custody of the district attorney, with the court to determine the amount of monetary penalties to be imposed upon the children. The Court will determine the severity of the child's injuries and determine whether to issue an order imposing a permanent restraining order or requiring the child to be restrained and/or restrained from participating in any form of physical or mental abuse. The order also requires the parents to provide a written explanation to the court concerning the nature of their alleged physical abuse."
