  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Social Security Administration (SSA) employee who was found incompetent to perform past relevant work.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Patricia Coley, a registered representative of the SSA, failed to adequately assess the severity of her impairment, including her sleep apnea and use of oxygen.  Coley also failed to show that she had a normal gait, had only minimal back treatment and mild MRJ findings, and had full hand grip strength and upper extremity range of motion.  According to the complaint, Coley told her doctor that she needed 24-hour care because her doctors recommended against more aggressive treatment, given her history of pulmonary emboli.  She also told her husband worked 16 hours a week and was not with her every day.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint Coley consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Coley for her role in the alleged misconduct.  A hearing for Coley is scheduled for May 17, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-11.  This case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Department of Justice's Office of Disability and Advocacy. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
