  "summary": "On May 30, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the defendants in a billing services agreement fraud case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Jersey, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to show that they were bound by the obligations under the agreement and were liable for over $6 million in damages arising from a breach of the agreement.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants expressly assumed and agreed to assume the obligations of the contracts when they entered into a strict foreclosure agreement with MediGain, LLC, which, in pertinent part, required them to pay a de facto merger and continuity of operations.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2.5 million.   The court also granted the defendants' motion for an injunction, which is subject to court approval, and ordered the defendants disgorgement of their alleged losses.  Finally, the court granted the parties' request for an asset freeze and a cease-and-desist order, which requires the parties to show cause why they are not entitled to an injunction as a matter of law. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Hirsch and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Jennifer A. Birkenheier. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Texas Department of Banking and Securities and Exchange Commission."
