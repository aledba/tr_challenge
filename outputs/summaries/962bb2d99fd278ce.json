  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the United States Department of Energy (DOE) for failing to adequately assess the potential impact of heavy-duty mining leases on Colorado River endangered fish.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, alleges that, in 2007 and 2008, DOE issued an order requiring it to prepare a programmatic environmental impact statement (EIS) for future mining leases. The EIS, which is intended to assess potential site-specific impacts of mining leases, was drafted with the understanding that DOE would use the information provided in the EIS to determine whether or not to proceed with the programmatic EIS. The court found that DOE failed to adequately consider the impact of the proposed leases on the threatened and endangered Colorado River fish. The Court also ruled that DOE violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered DOE to comply with the requirements of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder.  In its order, the court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the project.  On March 21, 2014, the Court issued a final order ordering DOE to submit an EIS that includes a detailed analysis of the potential impacts of the mining leases and to consider whether to suspend or revoke those leases pending approval by the federal agency.  According to the court's order, DOE's EIS was drafted in the context of a well-ordered NEPA review, and that it had not received any relevant information about the proposed mining leases at the time of the order. The order also requires DOE to conduct an environmental analysis before it issues an order suspending the program.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, DOE has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws, orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the company to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Environmental Working Group v. Colorado Department of Natural Resources, 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(3)  The Commission on Environmental Quality has issued an Order requiring DOE to provide an accounting of the risks and benefits of any mining leases that may be affected by the proposed lease changes. The Commission has also issued a Request for a Temporary Restraining Order, which requires the Commission to provide a detailed accounting of any potential adverse environmental impacts."
