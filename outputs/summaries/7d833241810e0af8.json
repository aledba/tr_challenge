  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Gregory M. Bell and his firm, Lancelot Offshore Investment Management, LLC, for defrauding investors in a Ponzi scheme.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on January 26, 2016, the defendants raised more than $3.5 billion from investors by falsely claiming that they were entitled to a share of a fund's losses when, in fact, they were not.  The SEC alleges that, contrary to the defendants' representations to investors, the fund's auditors failed to detect that the fund had suffered losses in 2008, when the fund was insolvent, when it was supposed to be recovering its losses.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the accountants failed to inform investors that their losses were a direct result of their misstatements and omissions, when in fact they were the result of a fraud perpetrated by the fund.  As alleged in the complaint, the funds' losses were separate and distinct from those suffered by other investors.  For example, one of the accountsants allegedly told investors that they could invest their money in a fund that had no assets and that the funds would be \"assetless\" if the fund did not have assets.

The court also granted the defendants the right to reapply for a hearing in the future on the same day as the final judgment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Bell and the other accountants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million, and ordering the receivership of their books and records. \u00c2\u00a0The judgment also prohibits Bell and Messrs.
