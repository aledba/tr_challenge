  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin today entered a final judgment in favor of a Chapter 13 trustee who has agreed to pay $2,750 to settle a civil action brought by the Lettie Letties.  According to the court's order, filed on November 19, 2018, the bankruptcy court granted the debtors' request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the trustee to distribute attorneys' fees prior to the conversion of their case to Chapter 7.  The court also granted the trustee's request for an asset freeze and a temporary asset freeze.  In its order, the court also ordered the bankruptcy trustee to pay attorney fees in a preconfirmation converted case.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this order is inconsistent with the bankruptcy judge's order.  For example, as set forth in the court order, in Harris v. Viegelahn, the trustee had to return all funds held by the debtor to the debtor at the time the case is converted to a Chapter 7 case, regardless of whether the debtor had achieved plan confirmation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the trustees agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay the fees in accordance with the agreed-upon manner of the court.  Additionally, the judgment prohibits the trustee from imposing pre-judgment fees on the debtor, even if the debtor's counsel had requested them to do so before any plan confirmation was made.   The SEC's order also orders the trustee not to exceed the amount of attorney fees it has already paid to certain debtors, and to pay a civil penalty of $1,500, which is equal to the amount owed to the trustee in the defaulted action.  On January 7, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint against the trustee for violating Section 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, charging him with violating Section 15(a)(2) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder.  It also charged the trustee with violating Sections 330(a), 503(b), and 1326, and with violating Rule 60(b).  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Werner. \u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
