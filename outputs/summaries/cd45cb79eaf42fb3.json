  "summary": "On July 24, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the father of two children who were allegedly abused and neglected by their father.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in New York, the father and his attorney, Zachariah V. (Zachariah), repeatedly told the daughter that he had never digitally penetrated the daughter's vagina or anus, that he only bathed with her while both of them were naked, and that during the baths the father would sometimes sit her on his lap, causing his penis to touch her \u201cbutt.\u201d  The court also found that, contrary to the father's statements, the daughter had not experienced any physical or sexual abuse, and the father had not engaged in any such conduct.  In addition, the court found that the father did not engage in any form of sexual abuse when he was cleaning the child's rectum or anus.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the mother had been asked during a telephone call whether she had ever seen the father digitally penetrate the daughter, and when she replied that she had not, she did not see the father do so until after she had had a bowel movement or diaper change to see if she required additional cleaning and, when necessary, cleaned her buttocks with soap and water.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Z.V. agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Dezarae T. (Lee V.), Michael J. (Michael J.), and Deena T. of the New York Regional Office, and was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Ms. T. and Ms. Graham. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Connecticut Department of Children and Families, the State Attorney General's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Connecticut, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Criminal Division's Office of Child and Family Education, the Division of Health and Human Services, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
