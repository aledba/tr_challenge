  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against the City of Amarillo and Terry L. Childers, in his official capacity as interim city manager, in an emergency action.  The SEC's complaint, filed on February 23, 2016, alleges that the Amarillo Fire Department and Childers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 180.006 of the federal securities laws by failing to properly classify FMO positions within the civil service.  According to the complaint, the city's failure to classify these positions was a breach of the agency's ministerial duties.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Childers failed to adequately disclose to the trial court that he was responsible for classification of FMO personnel within the fire department and failed to timely name a necessary party to the case.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Childers consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  Childers has also agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency.  On February 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy M. McCole granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order against Childers and ordered Childers to comply with the court's order.  McCole also granted the request for an asset freeze and a bar prohibiting Childers from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the municipal securities laws.
