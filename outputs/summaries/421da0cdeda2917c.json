  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against two California real estate licensees for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dixon, California, alleges that Gregory and Jennifer House illegally entered into a six-year agricultural lease with Paul Moller for 35 farmable acres of the property. According to the complaint, the leases included a right of first refusal for any offer to sell the property during the term of the lease. The complaint alleges that the leases also included an option for a \"cash out sale\" in which the Houses could acquire the property at a later date. The SEC alleges that Moller and the Fosses violated Section 1021.9 of the Exchange Act by trespassing on the property and destroying or destroying the farm's organic certification status and animal forage. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Houses consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay $16,178 in disgorgement and $116,920 in prejudgment interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Gregory House, Jennifer House, and Edward Foss.  Gregory House has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and ordered to pay a $1.25 million civil penalty. Edward Foss agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $160,000. The settlements are subject to Court approval. The litigation will be led by Jennifer House and Gregory House.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
