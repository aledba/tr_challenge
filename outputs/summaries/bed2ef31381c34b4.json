  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by Oletta Mott, a Kansas resident, alleging she was injured by shooting fireworks in a trailer park during an Independence Day celebration on July 4, 2015.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Kansas City, Scott alleges that Donald Ewing, a banker, hosted the event and set off the fireworks.  The complaint alleges that Scott, through discovery, learned that Ewing did not light the fireworks and that he did not control the property where Scott sustained her injuries.  Scott's amended petition was filed one day before the two-year statute of limitations expired, and the limitations period remained tolled until the court granted the motion to intervene.  In a parallel action, the Kansas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Scott arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On August 23, 2017, the district court granted summary judgment against Scott, finding her liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Scott to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott's attorney, Fred Phelps, and Scott's wife, Lillian Price, and is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Scott and Lillian Mott. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Kansas District of Columbia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Kansas Secretary of State's Office."
