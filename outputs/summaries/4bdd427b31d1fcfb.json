  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Hampshire today announced criminal charges against FairPoint Logistics, Inc., a New Hampshire-based telecommunications company that provides voice and broadband internet services to residential, business, and wholesale customers throughout New Hampshire.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portsmouth, N.H., alleges that, in August 2014, FairPoint terminated its contract with two unions, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). According to the complaint, the strike resulted in atypical increases in FairPoint's \"Troubled Load\" and \"Order Load\" during the period they were on strike. The complaint also alleges that the strike result in a \"stoppage of work\" that required FairPoint to assign management employees and contract workers to perform tasks that had to be performed by union members in order to provide service to existing customers. The SEC alleges that FairPoint did not comply with the Commission's recommendation to reopen the case, and the Commission agreed to a final judgment that permanently enjoins FairPoint from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the Commission to conduct a de novo rehearing before a new appeal tribunal. The Commission's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, reserves the issue of whether a substantial curtailment of work should be allowed to proceed.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Department of Health and Human Services today announced that it has instituted an investigation that is being conducted by the Office of Inspector General's Retail Strategy Task Force. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Department of Justice today announced an asset freeze and related criminal proceedings against Fairpoint.  According to a press release announcing the asset freeze, the SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper."
