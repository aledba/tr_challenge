  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin today entered a final judgment in favor of finding that the seventy-two-hour time limit is mandatory for a person to submit a conditional release.  The court entered the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint against the Department of Health Services (WSHS) for failing to comply with a mandatory time limit.  In its judgment, the court found that, contrary to the stated intent of the federal government, WSHS required the Department to submit its statement of probable cause and petition to revoke a person\u2019s conditional release within sixty-two hours of filing with the court. The court also ordered that the Department submit a statement to the court and the regional office of the state public defender by Monday, October 23, 2017. The Court also issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Department from delaying the filing of its statement and petition for a revocation.  On November 14, 2017, the Court held a hearing on a motion to revoke Olson's conditional release, which was not held within 72 hours of the Department submitting its statement. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Olson.  According to the complaint, Olson was arrested on October 18, 2017 and was immediately taken into custody by the Department. The complaint alleges that he was simply being detained, unilaterally, by the state, when the time limit for submitting a revocation petition was 48 hours and 72 hours late. The State also alleges that Olson had recently smoked methamphetamine, which is not akin to the \"nominal procedural delays\" addressed in R.R.E. v. Fitzgerald, 2002 WI 43, \u00b612, 643 N.W.2d 771. The U. S. Attorney for the Northern District of Michigan today announced parallel criminal prosecutions against Olson, and that the court will determine whether to impose a penalty or prohibition on the violation of the time-limit. The SEC also issued an order suspending the issuance of a cease-and-desist order against Olson and ordering him to surrender his passport and be enjoined from associating with any person with whom he or she has a history of criminal conduct. The order also prohibits Olson from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including through his work as an accountant or as an investment adviser. The federal district court for the Central District of New York today entered final judgments against Olson that permanently enjoin him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in"
