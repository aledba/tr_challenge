  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New York City firefighter accused of defrauding his second wife out of millions of dollars.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Carol Kraus and Richard Kraus were married in 1973 and had four adult children.  The complaint alleges that the defendant secured a loan against his pension from the FDNY, which reduced the value of the defendant's share of the pension.  As alleged in the complaint, the loan repayment and the provision of survivor's pension benefits were not expressly prohibited by the stipulation, and the defendant was entitled to a share of her pension based on the amount of the loan repaid at the time of the divorce.  In addition, the complaint alleged that, after the divorce was finalized, the defendant took out a personal loan against the pension, which resulted in a reduction in his share of pension benefits.  To repay the loan, the plaintiff had to pay a portion of the amount owed to her by her second wife.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amounts of $8,503.24 and $66,157.02, respectively.  On March 26, 2013, the court entered a judgment against the defendant in a civil action brought by the SEC against him, ordering him to pay $1.2 million in restitution and a civil penalty of $100,000, and ordering the payment of a $50,000 civil penalty.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for April 19, 2013.  Following the court's order, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Brooklyn, New York, charging the defendant with violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal pension law, Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, and Rule 15a-3 thereunder.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the New York Regional Office.
