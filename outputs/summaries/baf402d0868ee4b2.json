  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against Aho Construction I, Inc., a Seattle-based construction company, and its general counsel, Steven Madsen, for failing to exhaust their remedies.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Moxee, Washington, Aho violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 16.70A.302(3)(b)(i) and Rules 16a-3, 13a-11, and 13b-13 thereunder, that Aho failed to exhaust its remedies in a timely manner.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action, charging Aho with violations of the federal securities laws, and seeking a court-ordered injunction against future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The SEC's Complaint alleges that the defendants failed to adequately exhaust all of their remedies, including, without limitation, the exemption provided by the federal district court for the southernmost district of Washington.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal, state, and local securities laws and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future. The judgments also order Aho to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties. The settlements are subject to court approval. The court also ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million, $2 million, and $100,000, respectively. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
