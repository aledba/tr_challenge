(\"Tietex\"), a Texas-based manufacturer of flame retardant products, for failing to adequately disclose material non-infringing issues in its patent application.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on February 23, 2018, filed in federal district court in New York, TietEx alleges that it failed to adequately inform the court of its obligations under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder, and failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claims.
