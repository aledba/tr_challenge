  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of George Bongiorno, a Connecticut businessman and investor, on its claims of successor liability and breach of contract.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Stamford, Connecticut, alleges that, in 1971, a Stamford, Conn.-based accounting firm was hired by George's family to provide accounting services for a liquor store owned and operated by his brother. According to the complaint, the firm performed accounting services pursuant to a longstanding agreement it had with George and was liable for the company's preexisting debts, such as those owed to the plaintiff. The complaint alleges that the firm failed to provide sufficient evidence to convince the court that it could not be held personally liable as a result of the firm nature of the business.  In its judgment, the court found that, as a matter of fact, the company was not liable under a specific provision of the federal liquor control laws, and that the company had no obligation to pay the $36,075.00 in unpaid invoices. The court also found that the plaintiff had no authority to determine whether she was liable as an executrix under the same provision, and, therefore, did not have the authority to issue a judgment in her favor.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  In a parallel action, the Connecticut Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the firm for its role in this matter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of insider trading in the securities of certain microcap issuers.
