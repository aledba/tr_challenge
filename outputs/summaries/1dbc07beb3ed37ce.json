  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Social Security Administration nominee Sharon Bradshaw, finding that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Bradshaw violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"ALJ\") by failing to raise the issue of issue exhaustion before the ALJ.  According to the complaint, Bradshaw was entitled to a hearing before an ALJ to determine whether to impose an issue-exhaustion requirement on her.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the SEC did not require Bradshaw to raise issues before the SEC, and that she did not raise those issues with the SEC as required by the federal law.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the SEC has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the SEC to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and ordering the agency to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in the amount of $20,000.  Bradshaw has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins her from raising the issue, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil monetary penalty, and a bar against her from appearing before a federal court as an officer or director of a public agency.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Jennifer Mascott and supervised by Marc Blau of the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, and the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York."
