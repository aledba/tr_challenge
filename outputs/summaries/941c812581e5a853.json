  "summary": "On January 24, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the former wife of a Florida man who allegedly attempted to sell and refinance the home. The court found that the former husband had no obligation to list the former marital home at any particular price because the evidence showed the husband never discussed a sale price. In fact, the court found, as alleged in the court's opinion, that the husband made diligent efforts to sell the home and failed to make the $118,500 equitable distribution payment to the wife until he sold or refinanced the home in order to satisfy the wife's equitable distribution obligation.  The court also found that, in reality, the husband did not list the home for a seven year period because the home was \"underwater,\" and he had no motivation to sell it merely to satisfy his obligation to pay the wife equitable distribution.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the husband.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, the defendants agreed to settle the charges against them by agreeing to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their equitable distributions to each other.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $118.500 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $100,000, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 26, 2018).
