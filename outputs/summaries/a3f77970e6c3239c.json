  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found unfit as a parent for failing to maintain reasonable progress towards reunification with his children.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, while incarcerated, the defendant failed to maintain a reasonable degree of concern and responsibility for his children's welfare.  According to the complaint, in August 2013, the court entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the father of three identical twin boys, Je. A. and E. A., who were also in the custody of the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS).  The complaint further alleges that the defendant was inconsistent with services, including attending substance abuse support group meetings, random urine drops, individual therapy, parenting coaching, and parent education, and that he failed to make reasonable progress toward reunification as a single parent.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that respondent failed to complete a mental health assessment and substance abuse assessment, which were recommended by the court, and failed to follow recommended services.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock at any time. The final judgments also require the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his civil penalty, and require the court to determine whether to issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the placement of the children. The court also ordered the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver.  On May 22, 2014, a federal district court judge in Chicago issued an order requiring the return of the twins to their mother, who was incarcerated at the time of the court's order. The order also requires that the receiver be accompanied by a public guardian.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Criminal Justice and the case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Child and Family Education. The SEC examination was conducted by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry."
