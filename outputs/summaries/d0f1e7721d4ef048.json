  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in favor of the Commission on Election Integrity, finding that, as a commissioner, he has a clear and indisputable right to participate in the Commission's work.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the Commission from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on November 16, 2017, the Commission requested that the Commission provide the Commission with documents related to its work on the subject.  As alleged in the complaint, however, that Commission staff did not receive documents from the Commission, and the Commission did not request that the documents be made available to the public.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order requiring the Commission to comply with Rule 10a-5, ordering it to submit a final report by the end of the month that would determine whether the Commission was entitled to a preliminary injunction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in the amount of $1,000,000. The Commission also agreed to pay a $2,500 civil penalty.  On November 19, 2018, the court granted the Commission and its co-defendant, Andrew Kossack, the SEC Board of Directors, an emergency asset freeze, and an asset freeze. The SEC's investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Justice's Office of Public Affairs. The litigation will be led by Timothy Snyder. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the Secretary of State's Office."
