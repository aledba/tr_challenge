  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Connecticut yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the city of New Haven in a workers' compensation case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that, on January 19, 2012, Patrick R. Ruwe, a physician, improperly terminated his employment in response to a city employee's desire to file a claim with the Commission alleging that the city had wrongfully terminated him in retaliation for bringing a Workers' Compensation claim.  According to the complaint, Ruwe's termination was not barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, which permits an employee to pursue a statutory cause of action without first exhausting the remedies provided for in the collective bargaining agreement.  In fact, the complaint alleges that the Commission improperly determined that, under \u00a731\u201351bb, the plaintiff's work was limited to four to five hours per day, in order to accommodate the city's desire for him to perform his second job.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the Commission agreed that \u00a731-51bb permits the plaintiff to file his claim in a court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of determining whether there is just cause to terminate the employee and whether the arbitrators manifestly disregarded the law. The Commission also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the city from violating the above-mentioned provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the city to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  Additionally, the court agreed that, in a parallel action, the city would have to determine whether to proceed with a civil action against the individual who had filed a claim pursuant to \u00a730\u2013290a.  It also ordered the company to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively.  On May 24, 2016, the Honorable Judge John R. Rymas of the United States District Court in Connecticut issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order against Ruwe and ordering him to comply with the court's order.  A hearing scheduled for June 21, 2018, was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
