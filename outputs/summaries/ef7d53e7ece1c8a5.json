  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee today entered a final judgment against a Tennessee-based company and its former general manager for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, alleges that AAR Aircraft Services, Inc. and Roger Porter, a Shelby County, Tennessee resident, agreed to settle the SEC's charges by agreeing to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders Porter to pay $250,000 in prejudgment interest and a $10,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  According to the complaint, Porter agreed to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the court's order, and agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the above-mentioned provisions. Porter also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $50,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement plus interest and penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Porter.  On May 25, 2018, the court granted Porter's motion for summary judgment and granted him a partial grant of summary judgment. The court also granted Porter the right to a permanent injunction, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security in a contract, and a penny stock bar against him.  Porter has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions, and ordering that he pay a $25,000 penalty.  Without admitting the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, AAR and Porter have agreed to permanent injunctions, to pay civil penalties, and to pay penny stock bars against each of them. In addition, Porter has agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to a 10-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The final judgment also prohibits Porter from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
