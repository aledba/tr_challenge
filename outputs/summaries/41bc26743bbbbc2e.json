  "summary": "On March 18, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of a second-degree murder in a Warehouse District nightclub.  The court found that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in New Orleans, Louisiana, on May 27, 2016, the defendant, in the company of his girlfriend, told the victim to \"take it somewhere else,\" and then shot the victim multiple times in the back.  As alleged in the complaint, the victim's injuries required seven surgical procedures to repair the damage, and he was unable to walk for more than a year.  On September 13, 2018, the court granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to be enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against the defendant.   The SEC's complaint charges the defendant with violations of Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2)(A)(3) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000, $20,000 and $1,500, respectively, for each of the charged crimes. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Patrick Guidry and Steve Nolan, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Guidry, Ms. Turner, and Mr. Nolan.
