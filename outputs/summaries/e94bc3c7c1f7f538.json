  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Vahan Kelerchian, a convicted felon who was convicted of wire fraud in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, from at least 2008 through 2010, the defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud the federal government by selling unregistered machineguns and laser sights to law enforcement agencies.  According to the complaint, in the second round of the alleged scheme, the Defendants falsely claimed that the Sheriff\u2019s Department was purchasing machineguns from an international gun importer.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the Defendants made false statements to the FBI and the FBI in connection with the sales of the machineguns.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, these defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a)(1)(A) and 5(b)(2)(B).  The complaint also alleges that in the third round, the defendant and his co-conspirator schemed to deceive the FBI into believing that the FBI had obtained the machinegun parts for the Sheriff's Department.  In reality, the FBI did not obtain the guns.  Rather, the SEC alleges, the conspirators defrauded the FBI out of approximately $10,000.    In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Kelchian.  This case, which is continuing, is being handled by Eric R. Kasper, Mark L. Gibson, and Glenn S. Gordon of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, the Illinois Department of Commerce, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Chicago Police Department, the Ohio Department of Banking and Insurance, the Kentucky Department of Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York Department of Justice, the Pennsylvania Department of Financial Services, the Florida Department of Insurance, and other state agencies in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.  Separately, the U. S. Attorney's Division for the Eastern District of Missouri today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an order freezing the assets of the defendants and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,500.
