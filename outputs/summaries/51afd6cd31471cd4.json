  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, on June 21, 2012, Stanley Humphries and Dante Bailey were playing pool at the Sand Dollar in St. Helena when they were confronted by a group of men who demanded a mutual combat charge.  The complaint alleges that Bailey and Appellant engaged in a verbal altercation, which led to Bailey's death.  As alleged in the complaint, Bailey was shot in the back and paralyzed from the waist down.  Bailey's girlfriend, Richard Green, who was present at the time of the shooting, and Robert Goodwine, a DJ at the club, both of whom were members of the same group, allegedly engaged in the verbal altercation.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of South Carolina today announced criminal charges against Bailey and Goodwine.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas and Paul Adam, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Bowers and Mr. Adam. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney`s Office for South Carolina, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Criminal Investigations, the FBI, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Federal Office of Inspector General (OIGRA).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (March 22, 2018).   In its continuing investigation, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  To learn more about mutual combat and self-defense, see Criminal Procedure Bulletin No. 206-1 (March 21, 2018) and Criminal Justice Alert No. 207-2 (June 21, 2013).  In related matters, the court has issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent examination of whether a defendant is capable of making a reasonable defense of himself or a person he controls, and to determine whether to issue a civil injunctive action.  Among other things, the case has been reviewed by the Office of Professional and Risk Analysis and the Division of Enforcement's Office of Criminal Investigations.  This matter is being handled by Joseph P. Sansone, Erickson, Michael R. McKinley, and John R."
