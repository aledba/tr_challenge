  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Bahir Ramiz Howard, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for the 2010 shooting death of Jerode Martez Paige.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Howard violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the complaint, Howard failed to show sufficient evidence to show that he was liable for the violations of the federal securities laws.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that he failed to object to a jury instruction that required him to be present during the deliberating phase of a criminal case.  For example, Howard allegedly told the jury that he would \"start fresh today,\" \"get him caught up to speed,\" and \"resume your deliberations.\"  Howard also allegedly told one of the jury members that he hid his pistol in a nearby truck.  As alleged, however, the jury found that Howard had sufficient information concerning the in-chambers meeting that he acted in self-defense by firing into the crowd and toward gunshots that he heard as he ran away from the scene.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Howard arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  Howard has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(1) and (3), and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Howard has consented to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and to the appointment of a receiver to assist him in this matter.  He has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Atlanta Police Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Atlanta Field Office of Criminal Investigations."
