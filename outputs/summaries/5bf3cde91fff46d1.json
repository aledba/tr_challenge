  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil action brought by the SEC against them.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, defendants agreed to arbitration under the terms of the AF arbitration agreement without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants agreed not to participate in the arbitration program because, as a result of a water loss in November 2012, the arbitration agreement in effect at the time of the loss did not apply to claims that arose and accrued while the original agreement was in effect.  As alleged, defendants also failed to disclose that, in some instances, defendants withdrew from the agreement before the date of the alleged water damage.  For example, in one case, defendants claimed that, before January 1, 2015, a company had entered into an arbitration agreement that excluded product liability claims from being subject to compulsory arbitration, even though the company had not entered into a contract that required it to arbitrate claims arising from a product liability claim that had already accrued.  Instead, defendants allegedly took the position that, once plaintiff and defendant had signed on to the agreement, they had the unfettered right to unilaterally change the arbitration process with respect to the claims that had been accrued, not when the employee filed his or her judicial complaint.   The court also denied the defendants\u2019 motion to compel arbitration.  On February 14, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, charging them with violations of the federal securities laws, and with violating Section 10\u00c2\u00a0of the Exchange Act, Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 13b2-3 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder and with aiding and abetting Defendants\u2019 violations of Section 15(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 12b-20.  Without admitting to the SEC\u2019s findings, defendants consented to the entry of an order requiring them to submit to arbitration a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Defendants also agreed to pay"
