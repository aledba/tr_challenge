  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against Gary J. Burwell, Jr. and his wife, Cynthia Jane Burwell.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, Burwell and Burwell violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Burwell agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, and that the settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Burwell in connection with the same conduct.  Burwell also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $50,000.  Without admitting to the allegations in the SEC complaint, the Burwell family consented to the entry of a final judgement that permanently enjoins Burwell from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and orders Burwell to pay disgorge of $150,000 and prejudgment interests of $1,524,531, respectively, in the amount of $2.5 million and $95,102, respectively. The court also granted the family's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the payment of any additional amount of premium, and ordered the estate to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  On November 7, 2011, the court issued an order suspending Burwell's registration as a party of record for purposes of appellate standing.  Following the court's order, the family filed a civil action, seeking a judgment that permanently restrains the estate from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and appointing a receiver to determine the appropriate amount of money to be distributed to the family as a result of the Court's order.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Minnesota Office of Insurance Regulation."
