  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against a former member of the 9 Trey Gangstas for his role in a 2014 drug deal that led to the death of Ray Murphy.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that Kevin B.J. Boyd and Blake Harris violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17-8-57 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Boyd, Harris, and Crutchfield agreed to sell methamphetamine in violation of the federal securities laws, and that they planned to use the proceeds to further the gang\u2019s interests.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Boyd told Harris that he was going to give the purchasers less drugs than the agreed-upon amount and that he planned to short-change the deal.  As alleged, however, Boyd and Harris did not have any discussions about the drug deal and instead simply planned to rob Murphy and his friend, Jurshia Jones, of Atlanta, who was at the time pregnant with Boyd's child.  Additionally, the SEC alleges that Harris told Boyd that he had \"committed murder\" when he was making a drug deal with Murphy and asked him to \"give it up\" before he and Boyd shot him in the buttocks.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Boyd has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $25,000 civil penalty.  Boyd has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
