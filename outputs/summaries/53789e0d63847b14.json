  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two former members of the Felony Lane Group for their roles in a scheme that defrauded retail investors out of millions of dollars.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that Xavier Romer and Jelcorby Kent engaged in a fraudulent scheme in which they stole purses and used the stolen identifications and financial instruments to fraudulently open credit-card accounts and buy merchandise. According to the complaint, Romer was involved in the scheme primarily in the Atlanta area but traveled to Michigan, Virginia, and Illinois to carry out the scheme. The complaint alleges that Romer, Kent, and other accomplices engaged in the fraud by stealing purses from retail investors and then using the stolen credentials and checks to commit the fraud. Romer also allegedly used fake identifications from the stolen purses to conceal his identity. The SEC also alleges that Kent and Romer participated in the fraudulent scheme by acting as a manager or supervisor in multiple states, including Michigan, Maryland, Virginia and Illinois.  Romer has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws and to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-reporting agency. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Romer. The case is being handled by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit, and the case has been supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Barry and Ms. Barry. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Florida Department of Banking and Securities and the Florida Division of Criminal Investigations."
