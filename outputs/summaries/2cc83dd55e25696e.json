  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of two drug-trafficking convictions and sentenced to 210 months in prison followed by five years of supervised release.  The court also ordered the defendant to show cause why he should not be barred from practicing law.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Orlando, Florida, Rolle was arrested as a result of an officer-arrested felon who had been involved in a car chase for a convicted felon. The complaint alleges that Dickerson, who was a member of the Tactical Anti-Crime Unit (TAC Unit), followed a Hyundai Sonata that he saw commit several traffic infractions in a residential area. Dickerson allegedly used a GPS tracking device to track the car, which was later revoked by the court. The SEC alleges that, after the third trial ended in a mistrial, Dickerson continued to follow the car and saw a black bag fly out of the passenger-side window and land in a grassy area on the side of the road. The court then issued a temporary restraining order halting the car's progress and ordered Dickerson to pay a $100,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against Dickerson.  On November 16, 2018, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for an emergency asset freeze and issued an order suspending the TAC unit from further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the suspension of Dickerson from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay $75,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and requires him to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The order also prohibits Dickerson and TAC Unit officers from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with a criminal proceeding.  Dickerson has consented, without admitting to the allegations, to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael R. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office.
