  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against Salem-based Pacific Realty Associates, L.P., a company that filed a site plan change application in 2006 to change the zoning of an 18.4-acre parcel of property in Salem from residential to retail commercial to commercial. According to the court's order, the company filed the site plan amendment application on the same day that the city denied it. The court found that, in denying the company\u2019s site plan application, the city improperly construed the 2007 rezone decision to find that a Costco store was not permitted on the property because it did not meet specific tree preservation requirements. In addition, the court ruled that the company had failed to adequately represent to the city that it had not met those requirements in its prior rezone application, and that the proposed Costco would not be included in the proposed site plan. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Oregon today announced criminal charges against the company.  The court also ordered the company to pay a civil penalty of $3.75 million.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the federal district court for the Southern District of New York issued an order suspending the company from appearing before the court as a defendant in a case brought by the agency. The SEC's order temporarily halted the case against Pacific, which was filed in federal court in Salem. The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy S. Cotter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Salem Office of Planning and Inspections, and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice."
