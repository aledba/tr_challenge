  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment against JBS USA, Inc., a Nebraska-based beef tenderloin puller, for failing to pay for treatment for a work-related injury.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Lincoln, Nebraska, on June 25, 2015, Escobar sustained an injury to his lower back as a result of an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment with JBS. The complaint alleges that the compensation court found that Escobar was entitled to temporary total disability benefits from February 17 through March 15, 2016, through maximum medical improvement. The court also found that, based upon the nature and extent of Escobar\u2019s injury, he should have been entitled to permanent total disability from February 23 through 25, 2016.  The SEC alleges that, contrary to the findings of the court, JBS paid Escobar $16,840.18 in emergency room and hospitalization charges. The SEC further alleges that JBS failed to pay Escobar any of the emergency room charges related to the injury. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Escobar.  In a related administrative proceeding, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York yesterday announced that it filed an emergency action charging Escobar with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering JBS to pay a civil penalty of $32,000, and ordering Escobar to pay an attorney fee of $2,745.70. The settlement is subject to court approval.  JBS agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $1.2 million civil penalty.  Escobar also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlements are subject to approval by the court.  A hearing is scheduled for October 21, 2017, for which a hearing will be held on the matter.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Dr. John McClellan, an orthopedic surgeon"
