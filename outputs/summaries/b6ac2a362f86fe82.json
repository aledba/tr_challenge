  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a widow who was barred from claiming her statutory share of her husband's estate.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City on June 24, 2017, a widower and his wife filed a civil injunctive action against each of them, alleging that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 321 of the Exchange Act, which provides for the right of a surviving spouse to acquire, hold, and redeem a certain portion of a spouse's estate, including the right to a share of the estate of the decedent.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, and order them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In addition, the court granted summary judgment against the defendants, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a civil penalty of $100,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael O'Rourke and Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Vermont Office of Financial Regulation."
