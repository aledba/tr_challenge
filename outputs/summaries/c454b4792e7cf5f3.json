  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against two individuals for their roles in a scheme to manipulate the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued an order requiring refineries and importers to meet certain requirements under the Renewable Fuels and Diversified Markets (RFS) program. According to the complaint, the order required refineries to meet the RFS requirements, which included a requirement that all RINs be sold at or above market prices. In addition, the complaint alleges that EPA failed to consider the fact that the RIN requirement was inconsistent with the federal law, and that the exemption from the exemption was unnecessary. The complaint further alleges that in 2016, EPA issued a final judgment that permanently enjoins the agency from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment also prohibits the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter or an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, and orders the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the receiver's assets, and ordering an asset freeze and other emergency relief. The SEC also announced that the receiver will be temporarily enjoined from further violations of the federal anti-fraud provisions.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the receiver has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of these provisions, ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $100,000. The receiver has also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Feb. 26, 2017).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General, the Office of Market Intelligence, and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The Office of Compliance Counsel has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt of the Chicago Regional Office. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson."
