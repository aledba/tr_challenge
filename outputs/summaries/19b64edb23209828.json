  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered final judgments against the New Jersey Department of Education's (DOE) Division of Pension and Benefits (Division) in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, alleges that the Division violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder. The complaint further alleges that, contrary to the stated intent of the Department of the Treasury, the Division failed to adequately consider the issues raised by the complaint, including whether a person with a disability should be entitled to disability retirement benefits. In addition, the complaint alleges that in violation of Section 5(a), the Division improperly delayed the filing of an independent medical examination for a member who had been terminated for a disability.  In a parallel action, the New York Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against one of the defendants.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on July 13, 2017 in federal district court in Manhattan, N.J. Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, Chief of the Division's Pension and Retirement System, and Chief of Inspections and Examinations Robert Welshhans, Jr. issued an order suspending the issuance of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the Division from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders the Division to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The Division's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.N. Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter.
