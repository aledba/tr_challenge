  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against Michigan-based Ammex, Inc. (\"Ammex\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Michigan, alleges that Michigan's Summer-Fuel Laws violate the federal securities laws because they are preempted by federal law.  According to the complaint, Michigan's summer-fuel laws, which are subject to federal law, impose a duty-free, 7.0-pig-per-gallon standard for gasoline sold in the United States.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the federal law prohibits states from imposing duties on foreign goods, including automobiles, and that the state law requires states to sell goods at prices that are \"reasonable.\"  The complaint also alleges that, in Michigan's case, the summer fuel laws were preempted because they conflict with the federal laws for duty free and gas-related products.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, Michigan has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000.  Michigan also has agreed to pay a $20,000 civil penalty.  Ammunex has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any federal product.  On May 17, 2018, the court granted a request for a preliminary injunction against Michigan's July 21, 2017, filing of a civil injunctive action, which is subject to court approval, to be instituted by the court upon motion of the court on June 1, 2017.  It also granted a temporary restraining order against Michigan and a temporary injunction against the filing of an enforcement action by the Department of Justice.   The court's order also prohibits Michigan from issuing or selling any security-related emergency relief other than for the purpose of enforcing federal laws. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and the Michigan Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
