  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that Dennis McGaugh III violated the collateral order provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, McGaugh was charged with first-degree murder in March 2017 and was sentenced to 17 years in prison.  McGaugh's complaint alleges that he was a gang member and was on GPS monitoring for another crime at the time of the murder.  As alleged, the court's denial of his motion to seal the affidavit was a \"final judgment.\"  The complaint also alleges that McGaugh failed to meet the three-pronged test that requires a court to determine whether a criminal defendant has a right to an interlocutory appeal.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, requires them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requires McGaugh to pay a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against McGaugh.  To learn more about collateral order violations, see Litigation Release Bulletin No. 17-cv-01-17.  For more information on the subject of collateral order enforcement, see Press Release Release No. 1291 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Kansas Division of Criminal Investigation. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kansas Attorney General's Office, and the Kansas Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court for the Central District of California, alleging that a defendant with a criminal record who has been convicted of a felony should be able to appeal to the court of his choice.    In its complaint, the Commission of Inspector General (OIG) charged McGaugh with violations of Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  OIG"
