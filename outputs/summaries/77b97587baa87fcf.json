  "summary": "On July 24, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a final judgment against Rosalba Songer, a California resident who was found disabled by a federal judge in September 2018.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Songer violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Songer was insured until September 30, 2009, when she had the following severe impairments: dysfunction of major joints, diabetes mellitus, and affective disorder; inability to read or write in English; and inability to perform any work other than what was performed in the past.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced that it filed criminal charges against Songer for her role in the Commission's decision to deny her Social Security benefits.  Songer has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars her from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Commission has also agreed to a permanent injunction prohibiting her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply for Social Security after five years of service.  On May 22, 2020, the SEC issued an order suspending Songer from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an independent, requiring her to show cause and manner of her disability before proceeding with a hearing.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1133 (Aug. 24, 2009).  The Commission's complaint charges Songer with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0The Securities Act.  It also seeks an injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. \u00c2\u00a0In a parallel administrative proceeding, the Court also issued a temporary restraining order, ordering Songer to comply with the SEC &rsqua;s request for an injunction.   The complaint also names as a relief defendant the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General (OIG) Fraud Section, and seeks an order appointing a receiver to oversee all aspects of the Department's fraud investigation."
