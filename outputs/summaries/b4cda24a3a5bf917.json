The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, alleges that BMW North America and BMW San Diego violated the antifraud provisions of the Song\u2013Beverly Consumer Warranty Act (Civ. Code, \u00a71790) and other consumer protection statutes by selling a used BMW 535i with prior collision damage and a protracted history of mechanical failure.  According to the complaint, the defendants agreed to pay $185,000 in attorney fees and costs, including $75,000 of the total recovery of $137,286 she initially sought, and to pay a civil penalty of $1,800.  BMW also agreed to disgorge $19,830.20, with $24,454.54 still owing on her loan, in an amount to be determined by a noticed motion.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, BMW and BMW have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their respective fees.
