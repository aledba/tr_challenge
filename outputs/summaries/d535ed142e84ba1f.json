  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Eddie Hilliard, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 40 years in prison and 20 years of supervised release for second-degree rape.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Hilliard violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Hilliard consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendant had a history of misconduct and had repeatedly failed to benefit from leniency in sentencing.  Hilliard also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, as well as to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and five years, and ordered him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer and director bar.  On November 8, 2018, the trial court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Hilliard and ordered a hearing on the merits of the case against him.  A hearing on November 9, 2018 was conducted by Tiffany O'Neal, a forensic interviewer for the Children's Advocacy Center of Northeast Louisiana, and Captain Anthony Evans of the Bastrop Police Department. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Inspector General, and the New York Police Department in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 25, 2016).  The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert witness.   The case is being supervised by Jennifer Graves, a licensed clinical trial attorney, and Anthony Evans, a public safety officer. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
