  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a California-based company and its assignee, Americorp Leasing, LLC, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Americorp violated the federal securities laws by failing to enforce pre-dispute jury trial waivers in California.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to meet the burden to show that enforcing the pre-prepared jury trial waiver would substantially diminish Handoush\u2019s substantive rights under California law.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206 of 1940, the federal district court for the Central District of California issued an order requiring Americorp to comply with the forum selection provision.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants\u2019 assets, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Americorp.  On January 10, 2017, a federal court granted a motion to dismiss a complaint filed by Wimsatt, AOL, and Verdugo, Inc., alleging violations of the federal pre-judgment provisions of the securities laws. The court also granted the complaint a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  To learn more about pre-trial jury trial waiving, see Litigation Release No. 17200 (Feb. 28, 2017).  The complaint also alleges that the defendants violated the anti-waiver provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(1) in the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b)(5) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, penny stock bars, and officer-and-director bars against the defendants.  Additionally, the SEC alleges violations of Section 15(a)-1 of the Exchange Act and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder of the Commission on Securities and Exchange Act Litigation Rules.  It seeks a permanent injunction against violations of these provisions, a jury trial exemption, and a penny stock bar against the Defendants, and an officer and director bar against each of the Defendants.  For further information, see Judgment No. 206-1"
