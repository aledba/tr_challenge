  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of Rodriguez, who has agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Phoenix, Arizona, alleges that Rodriguez was in a gang when he and a fellow gang member followed a man to Monterey Park, where Rodriguez shot and wounded the man. According to the complaint, Rodriguez told the informant that Rodriguez and his \"crime partner\" did a shooting \"attempted murder\" and did a gun enhancement. The complaint alleges Rodriguez replied, \u201cFuckin, uh, they know everything fool.\u201d The complaint further alleges Rodriguez failed to disclose to the trial court that he had been convicted of the premeditation enhancement and that the jury had deliberated for an hour and forty minutes before finding Rodriguez guilty. The SEC also alleges Rodriguez forfeited his right to a fair trial by failing to raise the issue of whether Rodriguez was entitled to a penalty equal to the penalty he would have received had he pleaded guilty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Rodriguez. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered Rodriguez to surrender his passport, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. Rodriguez agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Arizona Department of Corrections, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Department of Criminal Justice."
