  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Style Corporation, a company that filed a lien against Denise Brackett Woodley of Bellevue Park, N.Y., a condominium complex.  The court found that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 26, 2017, Woodley's condominium unit was occupied by a tenant who gave Servpro permission to enter and set up its equipment. The complaint alleges that Woodley did not speak with Servpro or her tenant prior to the work completed between September 17 and September 20, and did not respond to requests for an attorney fee or reasonable attorneys' fees to be paid by the tenant. The court declined to release the lien because it was frivolous and clearly excessive.  In a related case, filed in the United States District Court in New York, the court issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order requiring Servpro to pay a civil penalty of $183,945.09, a penalty equal to the amount of the property owner's lien, and a bar against Woodley from appearing before the court as an attorney or practicing before the SEC as a judge.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York Office of Inspector General in this matter."
