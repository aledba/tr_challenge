  "summary": "On January 22, 2015, the Ohio Department of Developmental Disabilities filed an emergency action to revoke the certifications of two Ohio-based developmental disabilities providers.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Ohio, alleges that John Flemon and his company, Hand & Hand MRDD Residential Services, Inc., violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the federal securities laws by failing to adequately assess the impact of the revocation order on their clients.  According to the complaint, the court of common pleas found that, based on the evidence presented at the hearing, Appellee had good cause to revoke Appelllee's provider certifications.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2010, the hearing examiner found instances where Hand and Hand had failed to complete background checks for employees who were working with developmentally-disabled clients. The complaint further alleges that in 2010, when a provider in violation of the same regulations, the department suspended the provider's certification.  As alleged in the complaint filed in federal court in Ohio, Appellee's failure to comply with the court's finding was unsupportable and inconsistent with the agency's findings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's emergency action, the agency consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  On February 6, 2017, a federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, issued an order ordering Appellance to revoke its provider certification. The court also ordered Appellate to comply by providing a copy of the final judgment, which was issued on January 8, 2016, in which the court found that the agency violated Section 5123.166 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Appellant was liable as to the amount of any monetary penalty to be determined by the court upon motion of the court by the SEC. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Appellante.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5123-166 (B)(4), (6) and (9) of the Exchange Act.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office and was supervised by Amy C. Barry of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and the case will be supervised by"
