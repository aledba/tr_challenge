  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida yesterday entered final judgments against a former husband and wife who filed a civil injunctive action in a parallel criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that Gregory Rawson and Lisa Rawson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Rawson's wife, who was a commissioned officer in the United States Navy, filed a petition for dissolution of marriage and other relief on November 9, 2015, alleging that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to award a lump sum alimony to the former wife. The complaint further alleges that the former husband took full advantage of an overpayment that resulted from their 2014 joint return by applying it to his own 2015 tax return.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that, on the date of filing of the amended complaint, the defendant took a full distribution from his 401(k) plan and drained the wife's retirement account along with his own.  He also allegedly told her that if she ever tried to come after him for a second year on the latter property, he would kill her and make it look like a suicide because she would be so crazy everyone would believe him.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of misappropriating investor funds.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, the SEC encourages investors to check whether their investments are being used for legitimate purposes, such as to determine whether they have sufficient assets to support a legitimate business."
