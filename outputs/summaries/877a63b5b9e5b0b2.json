  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Montana today entered a final judgment in favor of PointCentral, LLC, a Montana-based company engaged in the business of property management and vacation rental services in Montana.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Montana on July 14, 2014, PointCentral and its owner, John and Katharine Stowe, raised the issue of whether the arbitration agreement was valid or unenforceable. The complaint alleges that PointCentral entered into an arbitration agreement with PointCentral in 2013 that provided for the right to acquire, sell, and support PointCentral products and services in managed residential properties from a third-party vendor. The SEC alleges that the agreement provided for a \"keyless entry component\" that enabled PointCentral to detect motion-based \"intrusion\" and immediately produce two infrared photographs depicting electrical sparks flying in the home.  The complaint further alleges that, instead of joining PointCentral as a defendant-tortfeasor, the agreement required it to separately apportioned contribution from an unsettled or unguarded joint tortfeasior in the primary negligence action.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Point Central and Stowe have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 27-1-703(4) of the federal securities laws, and requiring them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against PointCentral.  On July 17, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a preliminary injunction, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court granted the SEC\u2019s request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Kurt L. Gottschall of the SEC Division of Enforcement. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson, Ms. Stowe and Ms. Klotz, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Montana Office of Insurance Regulation, and the Montana Secretary of State Office in this matter."
