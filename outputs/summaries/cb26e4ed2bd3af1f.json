  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a class action action brought by California residents against Honeywell International, Inc.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, on May 2, 2012, the court approved a settlement that required defendants to pay $3,056,250 in attorney fees to class counsel.  The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to establish their standing as members of the class by submitting insufficient evidence to justify the amount of attorney fees awarded to them.  In addition, the complaint alleges, as alleged in the complaint, that defendants did not adequately record their spending on the case and instead relied on a \"lodestar method\" to determine whether the fees should be awarded in a reasonable amount.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On May 4, 2014, a federal district court in California granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, entered a default judgment against the defendants, and ordered the defendants to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay officer-and-director and penny stock bars.  To settle the case, defendants agreed to pay a total of $8,150,000, plus interest and penalties equal to the amounts of their fees and expenses.  Defendants also agreed to be barred from serving as unregistered broker-dealers or investment advisers.  As a result of the settlement, defendants will be prohibited from participating in any offering of securities, and their fees will be distributed as a percentage of settlement funds.  For example, the settlement is subject to court approval, and the court will determine the appropriate amount of fees to be distributed.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. McCluskey and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the California Secretary of State's Office have issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free"
