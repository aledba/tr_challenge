  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered final judgments against Chubb Properties, LLC (\"Chubb\"), a New Jersey-based real estate developer, and its tax assessor, Denis J. McGuire, for violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, Chubb, who purchased a multi-tenanted office building located at 160 Chubb Avenue, Lyndhurst, N.J., in 2013, obtained construction permits for the property in 2013. The permit application, filed in federal district court in Newark, New Jersey, alleges that Chubb did not waive Freeze Act protection for the 2017 tax year, and that the property was substantially unoccupied at the time of Chubb's purchase. The court also found that the permit application was in excess of the true value of the subject property and that Lyndhurst failed to make a prima facie showing that a substantial and meaningful change in value occurred between base year and freeze year 2015 when Chubb purchased the property.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that it has filed an emergency action to halt the implementation of the Freeze Act.  The SEC's complaint charges Chubb with violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, Chub has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 10\u00c2\u00a0the Exchange Act and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Department of Commerce, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
