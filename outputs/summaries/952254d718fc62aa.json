  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon for unlawfully accessing a government computer, falsifying monthly bail bond report information, and obtaining property by false pretenses.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Timothy T. \"Tim\" Pardeau, a former deputy commissioner of the Department of Insurance, unlawfully accessed the government computer and falsified monthly reports in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from January through June 2015, Defendant accessed and submitted to the agency monthly reports for the purpose of obtaining bonds for an unlicensed in-state dealer.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Defendant entered and submitted false reports to the department of insurance, falsified the monthly reports, and failed to disclose that he had access to those reports.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $3,225. The judgment also prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a company or state.  On August 2, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy P. Hinton granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty. The court also granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the North Carolina Secretary of State, the FBI, and the FBI in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 551, 571, 599 S.E.2d 515, 2017."
