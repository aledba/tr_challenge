  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against Jive Communication, Inc.'s (Jive), purchase of a business from Plaintiff, KnighTek, LLC, and a related entity. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Jive and Knightek agreed to acquire the business in exchange for a percentage of the company's revenue. The complaint alleges that Jive sought to obtain a discount on the purchase of the business, including, among other things, Customer Accounts. The SEC alleges that, in a series of emails, Jike allegedly told the firm that it was in final negotiations to sell the business and that it would use its limited funds to pay other businesses that were willing to accept a discounted payoff of monies still due from their acquisition by Jive. Jive allegedly failed to disclose the pending transaction to its officers and directors, and instead wired a lump-sum payment of $1,750,000.00 to the firm's then-current CEO, Benjamin King, who was in the process of signing the Letter of Intent.  The SEC's Complaint, filed on February 6, 2018, charges Jive with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Jive has also agreed to pay a $1.75 million civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Jike.  On February 8, 2018 Jive announced it was acquiring Jive for $342,000, and on March 15, 2015, it issued warrants to acquire 15,000 shares of Jive common stock. On February 9, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Knigh and King, charging them with violations of Section 10 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Jives and King consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering Jive to pay $998,442.89 in prejudgment interests, and ordering Knigh to pay civil penalties of $250,000 each. The settlements are subject to Court approval. In a related administrative proceeding, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct a parallel investigation."
