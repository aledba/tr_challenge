  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Michael Colihan, a New York City attorney who was suspended from practicing law in 2014 for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, from at least June 2014 through March 2018, the defendants violated the charging lien provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") by failing to keep contemporaneous time records.  According to the complaint, the pendency of the litigation resulted in the defendants' inability to recover fees from the defendants.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to adequately record the amount of time they spent on the litigation tasks, which included depositions, preparing motions in limine, preparing motion to compel, preparing witnesses, and engaging an expert.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from future violations of the charged lien provision, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On May 9, 2019, the court granted a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and ordered the defendants to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and to pay a civil penalty of $12,701. The court also granted the defendants the right to reapply for the same amount of attorney's fees in the future without prejudice to the parties' motion for a preliminary injunction, and to appoint a receiver for the relief sought by the SEC. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Feb. 26, 2019)."
