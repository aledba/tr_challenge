  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arkansas today entered final judgments against the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission, Lawrence Bengal, W. Frank Morledge, Mike Davis, Lee Dawkins, Jerry Langley, Jim Phillips, Chris Weiser, Timothy Smith, Charles Wohlford and Thomas McWilliams in an administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed on January 22, 2018, alleges that the Arkansas State Claims Commission violated the antifraud provisions of the Arkansas Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by improperly concluding that the state had waived sovereign immunity pursuant to article 5, Section 13 of the United States Constitution. The complaint further alleges that, based on the AOGC's findings, the court should have issued a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the Arkansas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed in federal district court in Little Rock, Arkansas, J.R. Hurd, Patricia Hurd McGregor, Victoria Hurd Goebel, David W. Killam, Tracy Leigh Killam-Dileo, Hurd Enterprises, Ltd., and Killam Oil Co., Ltd., filed administrative actions against the state pursuant to the APA. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the return of the defendants' allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest.  On February 24, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in the Pulaski County Circuit Court against Bengal, alleging that he violated the pre-judgment provisions of Section 15-72-110 of the state's Administrative Rules of Practice (APAs) and that he aided and abetted violations of those provisions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Bengal consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin him from violating these provisions, and from participating in any future administrative proceedings. The final judgments also order Bengal to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is $20,000 less than the amount of royalty paid by SWN to the individual defendants. The settlement is subject to court approval.  An SEC order appointing a receiver to determine whether to proceed with the litigation will be subject to the court's approval. The Commission's investigation was conducted by Scott Frost and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation is being led by Lawrence Bengal. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter and Amy S. Cotter."
