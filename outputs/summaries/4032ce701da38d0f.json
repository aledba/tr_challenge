  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against Kelly Daniel Bass, Jr., a former Cumberland County Sheriff, for his role in a recent double jeopardy case. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, Bass was indicted on three counts of felony and two counts of double jeopardy in 2016. The SEC alleges that Bass made a pre-trial objection to a motion for a speedy trial based on a violation of his constitutional and statutory right to counsel. The complaint alleges that, on March 21, 2017, Bass told the trial judge that he had been told by a state police officer that the trial court would determine whether or not to grant a motion to suppress Bass\u2019s motion. Bass also allegedly claimed that, during the course of the trial, he made a clear and unequivocal request for counsel when he made the statement approximately eight minutes and thirty seconds into his interview with Detective Ownby, prior to his release from Central State Hospital. The court found that Bass did not make a timely objection to the speedy trial and that he did not comply with the requirements of the federal securities laws. Instead, the court granted Bass a temporary restraining order preventing him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Bass to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.
