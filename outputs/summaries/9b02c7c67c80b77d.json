  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the family division that terminated the parental rights of both mother and father with respect to their child, N.L.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in New York, the court terminated mother's parental rights based on insufficient evidence to determine whether father would be able to resume his parental duties within a reasonable period of time.  The court also found that the court failed to consider the significant impact of mother's incarceration on her ability to resume her parental duties.  In its judgment, which was unsealed on May 24, 2018, the Court found that, based on the facts of the case, mother had not seen or had any contact with her child since she was taken into state custody in August 2017, and that she had not been able to contact her foster family for several months.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, mother consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On May 25, 2018 the court issued a final order permanently enjoining mother from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to return to the custody of her child, and imposing a five-year officer-director bar.  Separately, the same court issued an order temporarily suspending mother from participating in any child-rearing activities, including providing an accounting of the number of children in her care, and appointing a receiver to oversee the child's placement in the agency's case.  It also ordered mother to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and to provide a $50,000 bar. The court's final judgment also prohibits mother from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in the securities of any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and prohibits her from associating with any broker-dealer or dealer who has a history of violating the securities laws.\u00c2\u00a0The court also prohibited mother from engaging in any conduct prejudgment against her in connection with the termination of her parental rights.   The Court's order against mother, father, and the receiver also ordered her to comply with the court order, which requires her to show cause and effect in a court proceeding."
