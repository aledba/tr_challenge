  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Kevin Hollis, Jr., who was convicted of two felony counts of assault with intent to commit murder and one count of felony-firearm possession.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in New York, Hollis was among the first defendants to be convicted of a felony when he was a member of a jury that deliberated on the two charges. The SEC alleges that Hollis and his attorney, Calvin Arnold, Jr. and four detectives, Kevin Primm, aided and abetted Hollis\u2019 and Primm\u2019s violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that, by agreeing to the defendants\u2019 supplemental instructions, the trial court did not commit a structural constitutional error, but rather averted one.  The SEC also alleges that defendant Hollis failed to disclose to the jury that he recognized defendant for three years before the shooting, the two had a disagreement the day before, and defendant asked Hollis if he wanted to fight before starting to shoot, calling Hollis by his nickname when doing so.  Hollis agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Hollis.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order, ordering Hollis to surrender his passport, and ordering Primm to comply with the court order. The court also ordered Primm and Arnold to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of Hollis's alleged role in the alleged scheme.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2018 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.  Separately, the SEC issued an Order suspending Hollis from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to provide evidence in support of the SEC.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Professional and Risk Analysis, with the assistance of the Division of Criminal Justice and the Department of Justice's Office of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by"
