  "summary": "The Boston Police Department today announced that it has obtained a final judgment against a former patrol officer for misconduct in connection with two unrelated cases.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleges that Jerome Hall-Brewster was not entitled to a predeprivation hearing because he did not participate in the investigations.  According to the complaint, in October 2011, a victim was assaulted outside a 7-Eleven convenience store in the Mission Hill area of Boston. The complaint alleges that Hall-brewster, who was assigned to patrol officer duty in District B-2, failed to respond to a question about whether he had a legitimate excuse for not working more diligently to locate Mr. Alemany in the prior two investigations. The SEC alleges that, in both the Parker Hill and Mission Hill cases, Hall- Brewster failed to provide sufficient due process for the investigation to conclude that he had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he violated the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and 5(b)(2) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"). The complaint also alleges that the complaint against Hall Brewster was supported by substantial evidence, including the fact that he failed to adequately record his conduct in the two investigations and failed to timely respond to the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against HallBrewster arising out of the same misconduct.  On November 6, 2013, the Boston District Attorney's Office issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation of the alleged Sanjay Wadhwa case. The receiver will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (March 21, 2013).  The case was supervised by Kelly Nee and Juan Torres of the Boston Regional Office, and the investigation was conducted by Michael Stratton and Thomas O'Leary of the Massachusetts Office of Inspector General. The litigation will be led by Mr. Stratton, Ms. Nee, and Ms. Torres. The case is being supervised by Shawn Murnahan of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit, under the supervision of Senior Trial Counsel Robert A. Hannan. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the Massachusetts Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
