  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jarret Eaglin, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 12 months of supervised release.  The court found that Eaglin violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and imposed a total Internet ban on him for a period of eleven years.  According to the court's order, Eaglin failed to register as a sex offender with the federal government and failed to comply with the relevant sentencing provisions of the federal criminal laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against Eaglin.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Eaglin with violating the anti-pornography provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a penalty equal to or greater than the amount of his sentence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court also ordered Eaglin to pay a $25,000 civil penalty, a $10,000 officer-and-director bar, and an $80,000 conduct-based injunctive penalty. The court also issued a temporary restraining order, temporarily enjoining Eaglin from accessing or viewing any adult pornography, and ordering him to pay an $8,500 civil penalty.

Office of the Inspector General issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an investor's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov account.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of online child pornography, warning investors to be aware of the dangers posed by online child predators. \u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Department of Justice today announced that it has obtained a court order halting the imposition of a total internet ban for the eleven-year period of Eaglin\u2019s supervised release, which is subject to court approval.
