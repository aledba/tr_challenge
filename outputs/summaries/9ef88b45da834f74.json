  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered final judgments against Enterprise Insurance Company, LLC, a Connecticut-based insurance company, and its owner, Patrick Tannone, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that, in 2005, the Connecticut Department of Insurance issued an order requiring insurance companies to provide underinsured motorist coverage when the insured was injured by a rental car owned by a self-insurer.  According to the complaint, the insurance companies failed to disclose that the injured motorist's insurance policy excluded them from the exemption.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the insurance company failed to adequately disclose to the injured that it had exhausted its remedy and that it was unable to recover from the injury.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Enterprise has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the injured person's civil penalty.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Jennifer Chun Barry of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Ms. Chun Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Office of Insurance Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Connecticut Secretary of State's Office.
