(WUFSI) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants from violating the arbitration provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Denver on June 14, 2017, the defendants agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint.  In its order, the court found that the defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(d) of The Securities Act, and Rules 5(b) and 5d-8 thereunder, and that the parties are bound by the arbitration provision. The court found, however, that neither the defendants nor the arbitrator are entitled to the right to arbitrate the case.

For example, the complaint alleges that West Union failed to show sufficient evidence to show that it was bound by an arbitration provision, that it had agreed to arbitration, or that it could not be determined by an arbitrator based on the facts of the matter. The complaint further alleges that, contrary to the representations in the complaint, Western Union has failed to demonstrate that it is bound by arbitration provisions in the Adviser Act and that it has not acted as an independent arbitrator in determining whether to enforce those provisions. The SEC's Complaint charges Western Union with violating Section 5 and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the charged provisions, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.
