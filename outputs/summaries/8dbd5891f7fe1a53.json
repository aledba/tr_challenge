  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the agency that terminated Misty Clark's parental rights to two of her children.  The court found that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, Clark and her husband, Brian Clark, sought to have their children placed with their grandparents in Indiana. The complaint alleges that Clark and Clark's grandparents, James and Bari Sargent, had been placed with the Sargents in Arizona and Arkansas, and that they had sought to place the children with their parents in Indiana, but were rebuffed by the agency. The court also ruled that the placement was in the children's best interest because the children had no fit parent to take them, and the grandparents had no place to live with the children. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Indiana today announced criminal charges against Clark. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Children and Family Services. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Office of Child and Family Affairs. The litigation will be led by James W. Sargant and Ms. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Indiana Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
