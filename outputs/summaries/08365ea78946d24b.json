  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Gilbert P. Hyatt, a California resident who has been granted more than 70 patents related to computer technology.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Hyatt violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Hyatt also violated the subpoena provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of California's Securities Act of 1933.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the subpoenas sought documents related to Hyatt's residency and income received in 1991 and 1992, his relationship to Philips, and any revenue generated therefrom from the licensing of his patents and the patent interference proceeding.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint Hyatt consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $490 million.  Hyatt agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions, ordering him to comply with the subpoena requirements, and appointing an attorney to represent him in the litigation.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer and director bar.  Finally, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Hyatt and ordered Hyatt to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and a penalty equal to the amount of his legal fees.  On August 2, 2011, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the New York District Court issued an order suspending Hyatt from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney in the case of a subpoena issued pursuant to the federal district court for the Northern District of California.  Sansone agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and ordered to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of Hyatt.  A hearing for Hyatt is scheduled for July 27, 2011. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in this matter."
