  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin yesterday entered a final judgment against the county and its corrections officer in a civil injunctive action.  The court found that the county violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the county to pay $2 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In its order, the court also ordered the jail to comply with the federal anti-fraud rules.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Chicago on January 31, 2017, the defendants agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The court also found that, contrary to the defendants\u2019 representations, the jail failed to adequately train its corrections officers in how to prevent and detect sexual assaults by inmates, and failed to impose a civil penalty against the jail.  As a result, the jury was unable to determine whether the defendants were liable for the county\u2019s violations of the federal securities laws, or whether the jail violated its own policies and practices.  On February 2, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Mascianica of the United States District Court in the Eastern District of Illinois granted the defendants a temporary restraining order, ordered a conduct-based injunction, and issued an order suspending the jail from issuing or selling any security or other security-related orders. The order also prohibits the county from imposing any civil penalties against the individual defendants.   The SEC's complaint charges the jail with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-director and penny stock bars against the defendants, as well as an officer and director bar against Christensen. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of Sections 10(e) and 14(b)(5) of Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20 thereunder. The case is being handled by John Rymas of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Daniel C. Hannan. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, and the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of Minnesota."
