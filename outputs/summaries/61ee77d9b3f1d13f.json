  "summary": "On January 9, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Timothy J. Burgess, Jr., a former principal at Ottawa Township High School District No. 140, that permanently restrains his ability to perform as a public school teacher.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, Burgess was dismissed on December 8, 2014, on the basis of a finding that he had violated the disciplinary provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Burgess made a series of unprovoked statements to the OTHS Board, including: (1) that he was tired of listening to Burgess for the past 11 years, (2) that Burgess had made a derogatory comment about Cartwright's hair during the September 2014 union meeting, and (3) that Doerrer had told him not to post anything on social media because he was all over underage girls.  In addition, Burgess allegedly told one of the Board's witnesses that he did not hear the \"pea brain\" comment and that he would \"sit down, little man\" if he heard it.  He also allegedly told another member of the board that he didn't want to hear the statement.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Burgess has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the securities laws and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and officer-and-director bar.  On February 2, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Burgess, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 17a(a)(1) and 17(b)(3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and Section 15(a), of the Exchange Act and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rule 206(3).  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Brian Guenther and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Illinois Attorney General's Office in this matter."
