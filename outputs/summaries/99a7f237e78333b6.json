  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Smitty's Supply, Inc., a packaging company based in Covington, La., that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, from at least February 2016 through at least March 2016, Lance Shelton, while working as a line leader, made material misrepresentations concerning the condition of his left knee.  According to the complaint, Mr. Shelton was injured in a work accident in February 2016 and was required to dump caps into the hopper.  He also allegedly had a pre-existing knee condition and had had an MRI on his right knee in August 2015 that showed a possible ACL tear.  In addition, the complaint alleges that after the September 2015 accident, Shelton complained of pain in both knees and a subsequent MRI revealed a \"possible ACL tear.\"  The complaint further alleges that shortly after the accident, he reported the fall to his supervisor and requested a partial summary judgment.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, the final judgment, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's Judgment, orders Smitty to pay $20,000.00 in civil penalties and attorney fees, and orders the company to pay a $40,000 civil penalty.  Smitty has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement of $673.23 in ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty and attorney fee.  On March 4, 2017, the Commission issued an order requiring Smitty\u2019s to pay civil penalties in the amount of $620,000, and requiring the employer to pay an attorney fee in the amounts of $1,500 and $2,500, respectively.   The Commission also ordered Smitty&rsquo;s to provide an accounting of its findings in a related administrative proceeding, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the New Orleans Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The Commission's litigation will be led by Ms. Basinger and Ms. Barry.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1723 (Feb. 26, 2016)."
