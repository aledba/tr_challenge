  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a second-degree battery defendant for his role in a January 2015 carjacking that resulted in a broken jaw.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on January 3, 2015, Johnquell Bibbins, then 25 years old, hit a motorcyclist in the face and fracturing his jaw. According to the complaint, the defendant, Keith McGuire, was at a yard sale at the time of the alleged battery when he was confronted by Mr. Bibbs. The complaint further alleges that the defendant \"ran up and swung on\" the victim, causing him to fracture his jaw and requiring him to be hospitalized for several weeks. The SEC alleges that he did not act in self-defense, and that the jury found him guilty of second degree battery. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced parallel criminal charges against Bibbs, charging him with the same conduct.  In its complaint, which was unsealed today, the SEC alleges in its complaint that, in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the pre-judgmental nature of the case, the adequacy of the evidence, the amount of the monetary penalty, and the severity of the penalty will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Bibbs consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities for a period of five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On August 19, 2016, the court granted a request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct a parallel criminal investigation. In its order granting the requested restraining order, the Court ordered that the SEC conduct an independent examination of the facts of the matter, including whether there was sufficient evidence to determine whether the defendant acted in self defense. The court also ordered that a hearing be held on the matter at a later date to determine the appropriate amount of monetary relief to be provided to the SEC by the SEC as well as by the Division of Criminal Justice.  A hearing on August 24, 2016 was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. EST. The hearing was delayed until after the SEC examination was conducted. The case was supervised by Assistant Chief of the Commission on the Securities and Exchange"
