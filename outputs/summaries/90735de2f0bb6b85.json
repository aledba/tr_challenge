  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado today announced criminal charges against two former Denver Police Department officers for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that Randy Murr and Devin Sparks violated Section 9.4.14 of the federal securities laws in connection with an incident involving excessive use of force.  According to the complaint, Murr falsely claimed that the MOS had the implied power to rescind the first disciplinary order and issue a second one.  Instead, the complaint alleges that Murr, who was previously employed by the DPD, had aggressively resisted and had been preparing to punch Sparks nine to ten times as he lay in a fetal position.  Murr later said that he had only assumed he had seen this alleged act of aggression when confronted with the SEC's prior decision.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Murr from future violations of the charged provisions, orders him to pay a civil penalty of three days, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for Colorado today filed criminal charges in the case against Murr. The SEC previously charged Murr with violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and ordered Murr to pay civil penalties of three times the amount of his officer-director salary. The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On August 19, 2010, the District Court for the Central District of New York issued an order requiring the Commission to review a disciplinary order issued by the Department of Safety. The order also required Murr be suspended for three days.  Last week, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a temporary restraining order, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation of the matter. The court granted the Commission's request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered the receiver to send a copy of the complaint to the receiver. The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Scott A. Kasper and Ms. Gaunt."
