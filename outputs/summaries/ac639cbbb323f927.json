  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least 1997 through at least 2011, Lilly, through its subsidiaries, marketed and sold a drug called \"selective inhibitors of phosphodiesterase (PDE) V\" in order to treat the condition of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to adequately disclose that the drug was a selective inhibitor of PDE5, and that it was effective for the treatment of BPH.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants did not adequately disclose to a jury that certain of the compounds in the \"PDE\" could be used as a treatment for BPH, or that some of those compounds were not effective at all.  Further, the SEC alleges that Lilly failed to disclose to the jury that, contrary to its claims, certain of these compounds were present and functional in the prostate and that others were not.  Finally, the court found that, despite Lilly's repeated efforts to convince the court to grant the SEC's motion for a new trial, Lilly did not comply with the court's order to grant a permanent injunction against further violations of the anti-fraud provisions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Lilly consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David Rotella and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
