  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of a temporary restraining order against Mary A. Jones and Curtis L. Jones, who were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that Mary was not a good influence on Kasey.  According to the court's order, Mary had difficulty maintaining stable employment and housing since 2011 when she was evicted from her home for nonpayment of rent and living expenses.  As alleged in the complaint, Mary was unable to provide a stable and stable living environment for Kasingy because she was dependent on others to provide her with a roof over her head.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mary.  On May 30, 2017, the Honorable Amy C. Mascianica of the U.N. District Judge's Office issued an order suspending Mary from appearing before the court as an attorney and ordering her to pay $1,437 per month in child support, which is equal to the amount of her monthly child support obligation.  Mary consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, and agreed to a permanent injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, as well as to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  To settle the SEC's charges, Mary agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, to be jointly and severally liable for civil penalties of $500,000 and $1 million, respectively.  She also agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and to a $50,000 officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  Separately, the Department of Health and Human Services today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against Mary, alleging that she violated Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2) and (3) provisions of the Exchange Act and Rules 15b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder, and that the court will determine the appropriate amount of restitution and a penalty based on those findings.
