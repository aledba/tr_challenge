  "summary": "On April 11, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against the California Department of Finance and the San Diego Regional Board in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that, in 2007, the federal government issued a federal permit for municipal stormwater discharge permits. The federal permit requires the municipal water quality control board to determine whether a permit is a federal mandate and not required by federal law. The court found that the federal permit required the municipal board to impose certain requirements that were not federal mandates. In addition, the court ruled that the city of San Diego had the right to determine which conditions were required to meet the federal requirements. In a parallel action, on April 9, 2016, the California Secretary of State's Office issued an order requiring the city to comply with certain of those requirements. The order requires the city and the regional board to jointly develop and implement a program to reduce the discharge of pollutants from municipal storm sewer systems. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the city, the county, and the state agreed to settle the matter by agreeing to the issuance of a temporary restraining order and to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of the city's civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC charged the city with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the city. The case is being handled by John Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica and Ms. Cottrill. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, and other relevant authorities."
