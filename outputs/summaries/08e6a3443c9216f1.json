  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Illinois today announced charges against a Columbia, Illinois man for his role in an attempted residential burglary.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on December 17, 2014, Joseph Garcia, a convicted felon, was falsely told by two officers that he had been released from prison and was going to buy a laptop off of Craigslist.  According to the complaint, the officers confronted Garcia about his alleged role in the alleged scheme, and confronted him about his failure to object to the admission of the videotaped interviews. The complaint alleges that Garcia agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 10 years and a $10,000 civil penalty. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Garcia to return to the United States.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice's Office of Inspector General today announced criminal charges against Garcia arising out of the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Garcia consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a $1,500 civil penalty against him. The judgment also prohibits Garcia from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any officer-and-director or director-level investigation of a criminal matter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Attorney General's Office, and the Missouri Department of Justice in this matter."
