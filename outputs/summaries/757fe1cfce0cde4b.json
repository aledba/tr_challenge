  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Medtron Software Intelligence Corporation and Metairie Gastroenterology, Inc., a New York-based medical practice management software company, in a breach of contract action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 2005, the two companies entered into a Remote Computing Service Agreement (RCSA) for the remote use of the software on ten computer workstations, with three authorized users (Dr. David Silvers, Dr. Nicholas J. Persich, and Roy Borchardt, P.A.). According to the complaint, the agreement provided for the right to remove authorized users from the agreement as a courtesy when the client represented that those users were no longer employed by the practice. The complaint further alleges that the Commission approved the Commission's September 22, 2015 notice of cancellation, without citing any authority for the early termination of the agreement.

The Commission also issued an order suspending the issuance of an order appointing a receiver to oversee the collection and processing of medical records related to the appointment of a receiver.  On March 14, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, charging them with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 13b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunction, and an order requiring the receiver to provide a copy of the contract to the receiver, and to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.00 per violation of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20 thereunder, as well as an accounting and customer support bar against the"
