  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire today entered a final judgment against a parent who has agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manchester, New Hampshire, alleges that the mother of two minor children, C.O. and G.L., failed to comply with the court's order to terminate her parental rights.  According to the complaint, the court improperly considered the mother's failure to acknowledge the abuse and neglect that led to her removal from her father's custody and ordered her to remain in out-of-home placement.  In addition, the complaint alleges that she failed to provide reasonable efforts to assist the mother in correcting the underlying issues of abuse or neglect, including her refusal to participate in child protection proceedings when she knew that the court had found that she had failed to correct the underlying problems.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the mother consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars her from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  She has also agreed to a permanent injunction prohibiting her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock or offering of any security, including the right to reapply after 12 months of being barred from the market for penny stock.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see SEC v. Kelly, No. 524-a, (Supp. 2018).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Hampshire announced criminal charges against the mother for her role in a related civil proceeding.  On March 29, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action (TPR) against the father of two children who had been removed from their parent's custody in an unrelated criminal proceeding, charging him with a felony for his role in the same conduct.  To learn more about TPR, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5, III (2014).  The complaint charges the father with violating Section 10(b)(5) of The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  It also charges the mother with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of"
