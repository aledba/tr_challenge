  "summary": "On December 11, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against Integrity House, Inc., a New Jersey-based charitable organization, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court found that Integrity House was entitled to charitable immunity based upon its receipt of approximately $252,000 in private contributions and $157,310 in contributions from for-profit entities.  According to the court's order, the amount of private contributions received by Integrity House in 2015 was too small to qualify it to qualify as charitable immunity.  In addition, as alleged in the complaint, Integrity House received less than one-tenth of one percent of the total revenue for the year in which the November 3, 2015 accident took place.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the court also ordered Integrity House to provide a summary judgment on the basis of its compliance with the charitable immunity provisions of the federal securities laws.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Kuchera, Kelly L. Gibson, and Eric R. Werner of the New York Regional Office, and was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Department of Health, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
