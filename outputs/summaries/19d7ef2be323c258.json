According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky on January 26, 2018, Steven Dale Eversole, a convicted felon who was sentenced to twenty years in prison for his role in the scheme, agreed to settle the charges against him by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $50,000.
