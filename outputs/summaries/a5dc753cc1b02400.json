  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of Sacramento for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, California, alleges that, in 2009, the city of Sacramento issued an order requiring the homeless to camp on public property for more than one consecutive night without a city permit.  According to the complaint, the order required the city to provide a reasonable explanation for why the homeless could not camp on private property without a permit, and that the city had a policy and practice of prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to adequately state that they had no alternative to camping, that their camping violated the federal and state laws, that they did not have a reasonable basis for engaging in such conduct, or to seek relief from specific allegedly impermissible applications of the city's camping ordinance, or that defendants had reasonable basis to justify their actions.  As a result of the court's order, the defendants were permanently enjoined from violating the federal, state, and local laws, including the camping and host-and-rescue provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and the anti-fraud provision of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and the related provisions of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $1,000, $2,500, and $100,000.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and ordered the city attorney to issue an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to proceed with a criminal case against each of the defendants.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the California Court of Appeals entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the securities laws, orders the receiver to provide an accounting of the losses, and orders the destruction of any evidence that may have been obtained in connection with the alleged violations."
