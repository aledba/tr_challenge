  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against a Kansas contractor who filed a lien with the district court to recover payment for his or her services.  The court entered the final judgment on the merits of the case against Haren & Laughlin Construction Co., Inc., a Kansas-based construction contractor.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Kansas City, Kansas, a contractor filed a mechanic's lien in October 2018 against a Lenexa, Kansas building contractor. The lien stated unpaid labor and materials costs in the amount of $418,627.10, the difference between $2,904,384.10 and $3,485,756.16, the value of the work the subcontractor asserted it performed at the time the lien was filed. The court granted the contractor's motion and ordered the contractor to file a response.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Kansas announced criminal charges against the contractor, who was also charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of Kansas law.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the contractor consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, and to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $150,000 and $100,000, respectively.  On a related administrative proceeding, the court entered a temporary restraining order and ordered Haren and Laughlin to comply with the court-ordered injunction, which is subject to court approval.  Haren has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged statutes, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a $50,000 civil penalty, and appoint a receiver to determine whether to issue an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver and ordering the receiver to pay an $80,000 penalty. The receiver is also required to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver, which will be reviewed by the receiver at a later date.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
