  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Henkel Corporation, a New York-based manufacturer of hair gel.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Henkel violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In its complaint, Henkel also alleges that, in violation of Section 349 of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, that it failed to adequately allege that the product produced flakes, and that it was not a \"no flakes\" product.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC also charged Henkel with violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  According to the SEC's order, filed on July 17, 2019, the court entered a temporary restraining order and entered an order freezing the assets of Henkel and prohibiting him from violating Exchange Act Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) and (c) and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Henkel has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Exchange Rule 12(b)(5) and Rules 5b-8 and 5a-11 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2019.  On July 24, 2019 the SEC filed an amended complaint, seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions, and a conduct-based injunction.  Among other things, the Court found that the defendants violated Exchange Act Section 349 and Rule 355, and ordered Henkel to disgorge $7.99, $1,038, and $2,049, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.   The court also ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties of $5,000 each. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Eric R. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Federal Office of the United States Secretary of State."
