  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon for his role in the July 6, 2017, shooting death of Karl Wolfer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that Terrence Mathis violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Mathis, who lives with his wife Lisa in a condominium complex in Lighthouse Point, Fla., told the officers that he needed an attorney because he had been shot and was on his way home from a liquor store.  He also allegedly claimed that a pimp and a prostitute were in the car with him, and that he had driven his car to the liquor store shortly before the shooting.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, however, the Ponzi-like nature of the alleged shooting was not sufficient to convince the jury that Mathis had been involved in the crime.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Florida today announced criminal charges against Mathis.  Mathis has agreed to settle the charges against him and to be barred from appearing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, he has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 240 months.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 922(g) No. 522 (n.1).  The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Finally, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of State Criminal Investigation."
