  "summary": "On May 22, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against Morning Star Partners, LLC, a Bethlehem, Pennsylvania-based real estate development company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the assets of Morning Star.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, Morning Star's application for a use variance, which is subject to court approval, failed to meet its burden of showing a hardship, and instead sought a special exception and/or collateral estoppel.  In its decision, the court found that the property was not a \"prime candidates\" for razing, and that it did not meet the criteria to qualify as a \"reasonable use\" of the property.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the ZHB granted Morning Star the right to apply for the use variance.  It also granted the company's request for a \"special exception\" and a \"conforming use variance,\" which is required under the federal securities laws, to convert the property into office space and a multi-family home.  Morning Star agreed to the granting of the special exception, which will provide for the construction of a single-family residence and an apartment above the garage.  On May 24, 2017, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an emergency asset freeze and other emergency relief.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Philadelphia Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Beall Fowler, Robert Romeril, Barbara Diamond, Timothy T. Stevens, Esquire, and Bruce Haines.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in this matter."
