  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Dominican Republic citizen who was arrested and charged with burglary in the second degree.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, in July 2011, the defendant entered a guilty plea to a felony burglary charge.  According to the complaint, as a result of his guilty plea, he was not required to preserve the claim as a matter of law because the court failed to inform him of potential consequences of his plea.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant did not seek to withdraw his plea and, again, did not inquire about potential immigration consequences.  Instead, the SEC alleges that defendants filed a motion to withdraw their guilty plea without a hearing, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a)(1) and (3) thereunder of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and that defendants are entitled to the preservation of their claim by virtue of their prior criminal convictions.  As a result, the court granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a new trial counsel to assist with the case.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Kathleen M. Burns of the U.N. Office for International Affairs issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The order also prohibits defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a court order or order. The court's order freezes the defendant's assets and prohibits him from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000 and a $500,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company or association with a foreign national. The Court also ordered him to sign a \"Notice of Immigration Consequences\" with the SEC, which includes a copy of the complaint filed in the United States District Court for the Central District of Florida. The SEC also ordered the defendant to submit a written consent to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar, and requires him to submit an affidavit responding to his allegations in the affirmative. The settlement is subject to court approval."
