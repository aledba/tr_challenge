  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Quadrant Structured Products Company, Ltd. (\"Athilon\") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Athilon Asset Acceptance Corp., for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Quadrant and its officers and directors violated the no-action provision of the federal securities laws by failing to comply with certain of the provisions of the agreement.  The complaint alleges that Quadrant violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder, and that, as a result of these violations, the company was unable to pay its obligations under the indenture or the securities.  Quadrant's complaint charges Quadrant with violations of Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 15b2-1, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering Quadrant to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and requiring the company to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On June 20, 2013, the SEC filed a complaint in the U. S. District court in Brooklyn, alleging that the defendants violated Section 15a of the Exchange Act and Rules 15b-20, 13a-1 and 13a2-3 thereunder and that Quadrants violated Section 17a-3 of the Act.  As alleged in the complaint, the complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgment of illusory gains with prejudgment interest, and a penny stock bar.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Kristin N. Johnson."
