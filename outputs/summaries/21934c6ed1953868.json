  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans today entered a final judgment in favor of class certification for the Orleans Levee District for the Parish of Orleans.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that the Commission on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and the Sewerage and Water Board (SWB) failed to properly certify the class of property owners affected by flooding caused by the failure of the 17th Street and London Avenue Canals in Orleans Parish.  According to the complaint, defendants were offered as an expert geotechnical engineer to analyze the potential liability of the two remaining defendants, the SWB and the DOTD, for flooding damages to their respective properties in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  In its judgment, the court found that defendants had failed to prove commonality, as required by the C.E. art. 591(B)(3), and superiority of the class.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Additionally, the judgment orders defendants to pay civil penalties of $1,000 each, $500, and $100,000, respectively, for each of the defendants' violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and requires the defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with interest, pay civil penalty, and pay a civil penalty in the amount of $2,500 each.  Finally, the order requires the parties to show cause and effect in a civil proceeding that is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-2984 (August 29, 2005).  The Commission has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of overcharging investors with risky investments.
