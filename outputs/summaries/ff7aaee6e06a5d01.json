  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of Culver City and five of its council members for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Culver, California, alleges that the city and its five council members violated the anti-SLAPP provisions by discussing a change to the parking restrictions in their neighborhood even though it was not on the agenda for the next council meeting.  According to the complaint, the city then delegated to the traffic engineer exclusive authority regarding changes to the city's parking restrictions.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, this action was exempt from the anti\u2013SLAPP provision because it concerned a matter affecting the public interest.  In addition, the complaint alleges that city staff members in the traffic engineering department failed to act on the church's letter and by acting upon it by placing it on the next agenda.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000, $20,000 in disgorgement, and $1,500 in prejudgment interest, and requires the city to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  On August 1, 2014, the Culver city council approved a new parking permit for Farragut Drive, which included the 1982 restrictions as one such zone.  At the council's August 11, 2014 meeting, Weissman mentioned the letter during the portion of the meeting set aside for the receipt and filing of correspondence from the public.  After a six-minute discussion with then-Mayor Meghan Sahli-Wells and Public Works Director and City Engineer Charles Herbertson, the council placed the issue of the new permit on a future agenda, even though the 2013 parking restrictions did not provide for a significant benefit to the public at large.  A judgment in their favor would provide a significant relief to the general public or a large class of persons.  Finally, the court found that the City Council violated the Brown Act in violation of Section 425.16, which requires that all meetings of a local agency's legislative body be open to thepublic for attendance by all. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u201954954.2, subd. (a)(2).  The court also found that City Council member Andrew Weissman violated the same rule when he refused to comply with a city staff member's request to review the 2014 parking restrictions pursuant to the 2013 regulations.  Weissman agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a hearing"
