  "summary": "On August 8, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York entered a final judgment against The ELIV Group, LLC, an unregistered investment and consulting group that Valente owned and operated in Albany, New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges Valente with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  According to the complaint, Valente recruited investors for ELIV through hotel conferences, seminars, and references from existing clients, and he used investors' funds to purchase various securities. The complaint alleges that, in exchange for managing these investments, he would be required to pay an annual 1% fee, which was well in excess of the 1% management fee that he had promised investors.  After Valente waived indictment, he was sentenced on November 20, 2015, and resentenced on July 20, 2017.  In its judgment, the court found that, based on the evidence presented in the SEC's investigation, that, on the basis of the material facts presented to the court, he should have been sentenced to 240 months on each of the first two counts, and 36 months on Count 3, all to run concurrently, and to three years of supervised release as it had previously imposed. The court also ordered Valente to pay restitution in the amount of $8,200,579.69.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's opinion, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a total of $10,616,113.39 in restitution, which is equal to the amount he has already paid in restitution.  On August 9, 2018, the Court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Valente from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, sale, or promotion of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of imprisonment.   The court granted the request for an injunction against future violations, and issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue and issue an order to revoke the asset freeze order. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Justice, and the Office of the United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut in this matter."
