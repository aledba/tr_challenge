  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found liable for a felony charge of premeditated murder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, on May 16, 2016, Earl Jones, a convicted felon, and his then-wife, Cyerra Prather, engaged in a series of taunting and other aggressive actions in the days and weeks leading up to the shooting. The complaint alleges that Jones, with prior convictions for aggravated murder and felony possession of a gun, attempted to convince the court that he was capable of a complete defense of self-defense based on the facts of the case, including that he had \"always carried a gun\" and that he \"was scared of little Wayne being around [Neri] and his guns.\" The complaint further alleges that when Jones confronted Prather's sister about the alleged threat, Prather confronted Jones about it and confronted him about it. Prather consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Jones from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Jones to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunction. The court also granted Jones the right to reapply for a hearing in the future.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Trombetta and supervised by Amy C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Department of Justice, and the Ohio State Department of Health and Human Services."
