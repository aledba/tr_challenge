  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment in favor of Eugene, Oregon, charging the city with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Eugene, Eugene imposed a \"quantity-based fee\" on certain entities that were not subject to the reporting requirements in the initiative.  The complaint alleges that the city's imposition of the fee was inconsistent with state and federal law because it imposed a fee on entities that used more than 2,640 pounds of hazardous substance.  As alleged in the complaint, the fee imposed the fee on those entities based on a definition of \"hazardous substance user\" that conflicts with the reporting provisions in the state law.  In addition, the complaint alleges, the city imposed a $2,640 fee on a number of entities that did not meet those reporting requirements.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Eugene has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the city from violating these provisions, and orders the city to pay a $1,500 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer and director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oregon Department of Health and Human Services, and the Oregon Office of Inspector General in this matter."
