  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the California Department of Transportation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Winters, California, alleges that, shortly after 10:00 p.m. on August 3, 2010, Thomas R. Roberts, a bus driver for a private company who transported developmentally delayed teenagers from their homes to work-training facilities, was the cause of the accident.  According to the complaint, Roberts was driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs when he was stopped by the CHP, and was unable to produce a valid driver's license at the time of the stop.  In a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Sherwood, who was charged with gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 946.6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. The court also granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering a hearing on the matter.  On August 9, 2011, the court granted the motion for an emergency court injunction, which is subject to court approval.  As set forth in the order, the Court will determine whether to grant the motion against the defendants based on the facts contained in the complaint.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 946-6, July 17, 2013.  An SEC order appointing a receiver for the victims of the crash will be instituted upon motion by the court upon motion of the relief defendants.  A hearing will be held on August 13, 2011.
