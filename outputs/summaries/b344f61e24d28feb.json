  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the District Attorney's Office from pursuing criminal charges against seven juvenile offenders.  The court's order, which was entered on May 18, 2018, requires that the court consider whether to divert a delinquency complaint from court action without affording the juvenile offender the opportunity to appear at the hearing.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Newark, N.J., a federal district judge in Somerset County issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the diversionary hearing to be conducted in open court.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against C.F., A.G., and T.S., charging them with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the judge has agreed to the entry of a permanent injunction and to the issuance of a cease-and-desist order, ordering the diversion of the complaints to be handled by the district attorney's office, the New Jersey Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS).  The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5:4A-71(b).  On May 19, 2019, the SEC filed an amended complaint against the defendant, charging him with violating Section 5 of the federal securities laws. The amended complaint also alleges that the judge failed to notice the juveniles of the diversion and to refer all seven complaints to the mandatory counsel calendar for court action. The SEC's amended complaint charges the defendant with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(1) and 13(b)(2) and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The complaint also seeks an officer-on-officer bar against the defendants, and an officer and director bar against each of them from participating in any form of adult-based adult-child diversion.  On June 5, 2019 the court issued an order requiring the defendants to appear in court for a hearing within one week of each other. The order also requires the judge to check the background of each of the defendants and determine whether they are competent to participate in any remedial education or counseling program. The court also ordered the defendant to provide a copy of the amended complaint to the court for review."
