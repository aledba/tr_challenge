  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Riverkeeper, Inc., a New York-based environmental law firm, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in a related case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan on December 7, 2018, Riverkeeper and the FAA agreed to the entry of a final consent judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to comply with the common interest exemption provisions of the federal securities laws.  The court also ordered Riverkeeper to provide a copy of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that the FAA signed with the agency in connection with a forthcoming environmental review for the LGAAIP.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the FAA and Riverkeeper consented to the issuance of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the exemption provisions.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order temporarily freezing the assets of the two agencies and ordering them to return the assets to the states.  On January 24, 2019, the Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order halting Riverkeeper's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordering it to produce documents that are consistent with the court's order. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the New York Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Office of Inspector General, the State Attorney General's Office of Criminal Justice, the Federal Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service and the New England Office of the Secretary of State's Office."
