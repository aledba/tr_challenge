  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a drug-induced homicide case.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on June 27, 2012, Augustina Taylor was found dead in the bathroom of her mother's home in Wheaton, Illinois.  According to the complaint, Taylor's death was caused by a combination of drugs, including heroin, crack cocaine, and a 9-millimeter handgun.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, Taylor was a heroin user who had been sentenced to nine years in prison for drug-related homicide.  In a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $5,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Complaint or the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  On August 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in Chicago granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay disgorgement of $7,500, which is equal to the amount of his civil penalty, and ordered that he pay a $25,500 civil penalty as well as a $50,000 officer-and-director bar.   The court also granted the defendants' request for an emergency court order to halt their unlawful distribution of the drug-addled substance and to appoint a receiver to oversee the receiver's distribution and processing of the substance. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and supervised by Eric R. LaFave. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
