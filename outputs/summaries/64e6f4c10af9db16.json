  "summary": "On June 6, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Biogen, Inc. and Pfizer Inc. (\"Pfizer\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Biogen and Pfizer violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Rule\u00c2\u00a05(b)(5) thereunder, and that defendants failed to adequately disclose to the jury that there was no evidence to support the jury's finding that the defendants were liable for induced infringement of the patents.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the jury was unable to determine whether or not to grant a new trial based on evidence presented to the court.  According to the complaint, the jury found that neither Biogen nor the defendants had the requisite knowledge or expertise to determine that the patents were valid.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Biogen consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $1,000,000.  Biogen also agreed to pay a $500,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Patent and Trademark Regulation."
