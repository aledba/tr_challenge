  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio on December 20, 2017 entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, alleges that, on September 16, 2013, the Miami County Engineer's Office (MSWCD) filed a petition for the improvement or replacement of the Children's Home drainage tile.  According to the complaint, the MSWCD's complaint alleged that, from 2005 through 2014, the children's home drainage tile was in poor condition and needed to be replaced.   The complaint further alleges that in addition to replacing the tile, the complaint also alleged that the contractor had failed to adequately assess the benefits of the project.  In a parallel action, on December 19, 2017, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Donnelly of the U.C. Division of Justice granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $13,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Miami Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Environmental Quality, the Internal Revenue Service, the Florida Office of Inspector General, the State Department of Justice, the Alabama Department of Banking and Securities and the Ohio Department of Health and Human Services."
