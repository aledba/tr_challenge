  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment against a defendant who has agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Omaha, Nebraska, alleges that on August 21, 2013, the Nebraska Court of Appeals found that defendant Nikko A. Jenkins was competent to proceed with the sentencing phase of the federal criminal case against him. According to the complaint, Jenkins told his sister and cousin that he was going to try to get a diagnosis of schizophrenia or a severe personality disorder and that he would rather have a three-judgment panel determine whether he was competent. The complaint further alleges that Jenkins' statements about having a \"mastermind,\" \"strategist,\" and \"chess player\" were fabricated. The court also found that Jenkins had a history of malingering, that he had been convicted of a prior felony, and that his mother had instructed him to commit a felony. The Court also ruled that Jenkins was entitled to the right to a jury trial based on his prior criminal conviction.  In its judgment, the court held a competency hearing on Jenkins' behalf on September 20, 2016, and granted him a temporary restraining order, barring him from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  On October 16, 2016 the court granted Jenkins' request for a preliminary injunction and ordered him to surrender his passport.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Jenkins consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the anti-malingering provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of The Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay a $150 million civil penalty, and have a $50,000 officer-and-director bar. The final judgment also orders Jenkins to pay $75,000 in disgorgement and a $10,000 civil penalty.  Jenkins also agreed to the appointment of a public defender to represent him in the case of his impending release from prison.  As part of the settlement, Jenkins agreed to a permanent injunction, to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit, and to be restrained from associating with any person with a serious mental illness. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about mental illness, see http://www.psychiatr.gov/mental-health."
