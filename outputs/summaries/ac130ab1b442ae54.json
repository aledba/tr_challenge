  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on October 15, 1998, Llewillyn Johnson, then 15 years old, shot his cousin Kena Brown in the head after telling her that he was going to meet her cousin Tari Brisco to deliver an ounce of cocaine.  According to the complaint, the defendant told Parson that he had intended to shoot Brown but decided to leave her in the car rather than take the time to shoot her and risk being caught.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant had the opportunity to present evidence to show that his criminal conduct was the product of immaturity, impetuosity, and failure to appreciate risks and consequences of his actions.  As alleged, however, the court found no abuse of discretion in sentencing defendant, and instead remanded him for resentencing on July 17, 2015.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Johnson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of his prison sentence.  Parson also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay disgorgement of $1,078.95 plus prejudgment interest of $2,038.95 and a $50,000 civil penalty for a second-degree murder.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 567 (Dec. 5, 2016).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Attorney General's Office, and the Illinois Department of Criminal Justice."
