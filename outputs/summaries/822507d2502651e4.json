  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Jeffrey Bailey and his parents, Shirley and Roger Bailey, for fraudulently inducing the sale of their company, Rig-Up Electrical Services, Inc., to the IRS.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Channelview, Texas, Jeffrey and Shirley Bailey convinced their son, Roy Johnson, to enter into a fraudulent inducement agreement that required the company to pay annual payroll taxes in the amount of $1 million. The complaint alleges that Jeffrey induced his parents into entering into the agreement because he knew about the outstanding payroll tax liability but did not disclose it to them until after the deal closed. The SEC alleges that the deal was unenforceable because the company had failed to forward hundreds of thousands of payroll taxes taken from employees checks during 2007 and stopped forwarding any funds during 2008. The court also found that Jeffrey had induced the company not to forward those payroll taxes to the agency.  The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the district court issued a judgment that permanently enjoins Jeffrey from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $2.2 million plus prejudgment interest of $0.05 per share, and a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate case, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jeffrey.
