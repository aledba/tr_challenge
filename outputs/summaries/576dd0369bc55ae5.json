  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a group of insurance companies accused of defrauding insurance companies out of millions of dollars.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (\"State Farm\") violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, State Farm falsely claimed that it was exempt from violating the federal securities laws when, in fact, it was not.  In fact, the complaint alleges that, as a result of the alleged violations of these provisions, the company was not able to comply with the federal requirements for a qualified protective order.  State Farm's complaint also alleges that it failed to adequately disclose to the insurance company that it received PHI from a non-covered entity in response to a federal order requiring it to maintain or disclose the PHI.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the State Farm defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 15, 2019, the Illinois Court of Appeals entered a temporary restraining order against State Farm, ordering the company to return or destroy any PHI that was produced or distributed pursuant to the exemption. The court granted the company's request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The order also prohibits State Farm from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-based security-related security measures, including the right to reapply after a court order requires it to do so. In addition, the court ordered that the company return any and all PHI that had been produced to it by a covered entity pursuant to an exemption from certain federal reporting requirements. In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained an order appointing an independent receiver to oversee the collection, processing, and destruction of PHI in connection with the purchase, sale, and sale of insurance policies. The SEC previously issued an order requiring the receiver to return all PHI produced to the covered entity within 60 days of the conclusion of the litigation.  Today, the SEC filed an enforcement action against the receiver, charging him with violations of the federal, state, and local reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, penny stock bars, and a penny stock bar against him."
