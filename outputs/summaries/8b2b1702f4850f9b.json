  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, a Chicago-based mortgage servicer, for defrauding its customers out of more than $1 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, from at least 2011 through at least 2013, the company misappropriated millions of dollars of customer funds to pay for its mortgage.  According to the complaint, in 2013 and 2014, the complaint alleged that the company had failed to adequately record and record Saccameno\u2019s misstatements in her bankruptcy filings and failed to inform her employer that she had missed two payments during her bankruptcy.  In addition, in 2014 and 2015, when the company filed for bankruptcy, it allegedly overrode its default and defaulted on its obligations under the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and orders them to pay $582,000 in disgorgement and $82,500 in prejudgment interest, with a civil penalty of $3,000,000 to be determined by the court upon motion by the parties.  O.C. also agreed to pay a $500,000 civil penalty, which is equal to the amount of the company's civil penalties, and a $50,000 penalty for each of the defendants\u2019 violations of the securities laws.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Insurance, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 21, 2013)."
