  "summary": "On July 9, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California entered a temporary restraining order and ordered the release of two Mexican men and their two sons from immigration detention.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the Central District of Texas, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois announced criminal charges against the father-son pair.  The complaint alleges that the father and son were separated from their father and were placed in the custody of their respective fathers.  As alleged in the complaint, the father was not released from custody and was instead being held in a facility where he and his son were being held.  In a parallel action, the federal government announced that it had obtained an emergency court order temporarily enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the father to be released on a later date.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the final judgment, and to be subject to court approval of the settlement.  On July 10, the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against the government from removing the fathers from the country without their children, and ordered them to return to their father-and-son bonds.  To learn more about family reunification, see Litigation Release Order No. 17-cv-17 (2014).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. L. I. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Mexican Attorney General's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Press Release Release No. 13-20 (2014) and Release Release Alert No. 1236.3 (2013)."
