  "summary": "On August 16, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against a former employee of the Illinois Public Health Service for his role in a medical malpractice case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in East St. Louis, Illinois, alleges that Kevin Clanton first visited nurse practitioner Denise Jordan for medical care after high blood pressure caused him to fail a pre-employment physical exam. According to the complaint, Jordan ordered routine lab work and diagnosed Clanton with obesity and hypertension. On Clanton\u2019s second visit, she gave him medication and asked him to come back in one week. On the third visit, Clanton did not return to see Jordan until he showed signs of kidney disease and joined the kidney transplant waiting list. The complaint alleges that Jordan never informed Clanton about the severity of his condition, his associated risks, or the factors that increased the risks for Clanton in particular. The court found no comparative negligence on Clanton's part and awarded him nearly $30 million in damages. The SEC alleges that Clanton violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Jordan consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal tort laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $30,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Missouri today announced criminal charges against Clanton. The case is being handled by Eric R. Werner and Glenn S. Gordon of the SEC Enforcement Division's Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner, Ms. Gordon, and Ms. Braunstein. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Insurance, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
