  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Jennifer C. Davis, an Ohio resident who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, filed on January 4, 2019, Jennifer filed a motion for a temporary restraining order against Mark Davis, a former loan officer at Chase Mortgage, and two other individuals who were also charged with violations of the federal securities laws.  The court found that Davis was not qualified under Section 3 of the Exchange Act to determine whether or not to grant a reasonable award of spousal support to either of the parties.  In a parallel action, on February 9, 2018, the court issued a judgment that permanently enjoins Davis from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Exchange Act, and orders her to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Jennifer consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating these provisions, ordering her to disgorge $213,540 in ill-gotten gains plus interest and penalties, and imposing a $37,500 civil penalty.  Jennifer also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty in the amount of $1,080,146.  Davis agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 5(b).  The SEC's order also prohibits Davis from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security in connection with a proposed shared parenting plan, and bars Davis from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney or as a public figure in a case involving a child under the age of 12.  On March 7, 2020, a federal district court in Ohio entered a judgment against Davis, finding her liable under Section 5 (a) for violations of Exchange Act Rule 5b2-3 and Rule 5a-14 thereunder, ordering Davis to pay civil penalties of $107,000, $32,500, and $20,000.  An administrative proceeding against Davis was ordered by the court against her, and the court ordered her to comply with the court order against her.  A hearing on March 9, 2020 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m."
