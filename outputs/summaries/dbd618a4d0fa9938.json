  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment against the estate of a Lenox, Iowa man who died in a gas can explosion.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Des Moines on February 8, 2013, James Wurster was injured by a chemical can explosion while attempting to burn some trash in a burn barrel.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the explosion, the gas can was not safe to burn, and the company failed to provide adequate warnings on the part of the jury.  In its judgment, the court found that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the court from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders the company to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also granted the company's motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the company\u2019s assets, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against further violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Iowa Department of Insurance, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service and the Iowa Office of Inspector General. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission\u00c2\u00a0Advisers to\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of people selling, offering\u00c2\u00a0an investment in\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0regardless of whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company and its former CEO.  Among other things, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, an officer and director bar, and a penny stock bar against future officers and directors of public companies."
