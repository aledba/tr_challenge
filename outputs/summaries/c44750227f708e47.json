  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a custody action brought by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) against N.M. E.M., her then-two-year-old brother, who was removed from parents' care based on allegations of physical abuse.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on December 8, 2016, the defendants agreed to the court's order that they be placed in kinship care and that they would not be removed from the family home until there was a determination as to the cause of the injuries.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against the Defendants for their roles in the alleged abuse and destruction of evidence in the case.

On December 16, the court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder. The court also denied the Defendants' requests to have a geneticist come in and determine whether the child should be placed with a parent or guardian without reasonable efforts to prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the parent's home without agency supervision.  As a result of the Court's order, Defendants were placed in the custody of the District of Columbia, which prohibits them from violating the federal securities laws, and from participating or participating in any offering or solicitation of an investment in a family service plan. The defendants were also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $1,000,000. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Natalie Stavas, and the case"
