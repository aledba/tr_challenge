  "summary": "On December 7, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Ohio entered a final judgment against the city of Cleveland and its public records administrator for failing to comply with a public records request.  The court found that a 37-day delay in providing records responsive to a public record request was unreasonable for purposes of statutory damages.  According to the court's order, the city failed to timely produce the requested records.  In a parallel action, on September 28, 2017, the court issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the city's assets, and ordering the city to produce all of the requested documents within a reasonable period of time.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the Ohio Attorney General's Office and the city consented to the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the city from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the city and the attorney general to pay $8,812.50 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $150,000. \u00c2\u00a0The court also granted the city the right to request an asset freeze and other emergency relief.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley. The litigation will be led by Daniel Nemeth. \u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U-S Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release Bulletin No. 559, 2014-Ohio-5767. The SEC thanks the Ohio Department of Public Safety for its assistance in this matter."
