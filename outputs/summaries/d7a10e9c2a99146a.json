  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against Sara Dees and her husband, Robert Dees, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that, on February 7, 2013, McCann conducted an interview of a suspected child abuse victim at her school. The complaint alleges that McCann conducted the interview because she had no reasonable suspicion that either child was in imminent danger. According to the complaint, the interview was conducted without a warrant, court order, or reasonable suspicion, and McCann did not have reasonable suspicion of the child's or her father's involvement in the matter. McCann also allegedly did not tell the child that he or she had been spanked. The SEC alleges that the same day McCann was arrested for the same conduct, she conducted an unannounced school interview of her daughter, Ka, and questioned her mother about whether she had spanked her. The court also found that McCann violated the Fourth Amendment by conducting the school interview without reasonable suspicion.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against McCann.  On February 13, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against McCann, charging her with violations of the federal securities laws, and seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, McCann has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and orders her to pay a civil monetary penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case is being supervised by Kelly Hunter, Chief of the San Diego Office of Public Education. The litigation will be led by Ms. Hunter and Ms. Dees. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the U. S. Attorney's Secret Service, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).
