  "summary": "On February 11, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the SEC.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to disclose to the jury that they received payments from a litigation investment company, not a traditional collateral source like medical insurance or medicare.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants were never identified as an expert witness because they were not permitted to present basic information about themselves to the court.  As a result, defendants were not able to provide any corroborating evidence to support their claims.  For example, the SEC alleges that, based on what he saw, Dr. Bach entered the intersection on a red light and was not paying proper attention as he approached the intersection where this collision occurred.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $2,500.  On February 13, 2020, the United States District Court in Atlanta entered an order granting the defendants the right to apply for a preliminary injunction, imposing a $25,000 civil penalty, and appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation.  To determine whether to proceed with the litigation action, the Court ordered the SEC to conduct a fact-finding investigation, which will be conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Atlanta Office of Insurance Regulation, and the Georgia Office of Financial Regulation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC also encourages investors to use\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov to\u00c2\u00a0find\u00c2\u00a0information\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0is\u00c2\u00a0available\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0the SEC\u00c2\u00a0"
