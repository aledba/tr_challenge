  "summary": "On May 10, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana entered final judgments against the Indiana Board of Tax Appeals for its decision to reverse a final determination that valued the real estate of Merrillville, Indiana, at $16,775,300.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Indianapolis on May 9, 2018 and unsealed yesterday, the court entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  The court also granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  In its final determination, the Court found that the defendants violated the antiligence provisions of the federal securities laws, and that the court had the right to order the court to reverse the final determination without prejudice to the parties' motion to proceed with the litigation.   The Court's order also prohibits the Defendants from imposing any monetary penalty or imposing a civil penalty against the defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The court also issued an order freezing the assets of the defendants and ordering the destruction of any evidence that may be relevant to the determination of the final judgment.\u00c2\u00a0On May 13, 2019, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York announced criminal charges against one of the Defendants.  On May 16, 2020, the SEC issued its final judgment against the Defendants, ordering them to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty and ordering a preliminary injunction against further violations of the anti-fraud provisions, ordering the Defendants to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of these provisions. The Court also ordered the Defendants not to violate any of the above-mentioned provisions, and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  To settle the case, the defendants agreed to settle the charges against them by consenting to permanent injunctions and to the imposition of civil penalties. The Defendants also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities. The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17"
