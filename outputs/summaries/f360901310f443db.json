  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against Kajla Petroleum, Inc. (Kajla), alleging that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Sacramento, California on May 22, 2015, Kajli was charged with violating the licensing provision of the federal securities laws.  The SEC alleges that, in 2010, the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control issued a conditional license to sell alcoholic beverages.  As alleged in the complaint, the license condition did not apply to the sale of single beer or malt beverages, and instead applied to the manufacture and sale of individual 22-ounce cans of beer.  Kajlo also alleged that the Department improperly substituted its own interpretation of one of the conditions in its complaint for the one that was reasonable.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a judgment against the Defendants, permanently enjoining the Defendants from violating these provisions, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, imposing civil penalties, and imposing officer-and-director and penny stock bars on the defendants.  On May 24, the District Court entered a temporary restraining order, ordering the Defendants to comply with the court's order, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively.   The Defendants also agreed to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any state-level liquor regulatory agency for five years, with the option of permanent injunctions and a penny stock bar, and to be prohibited from serving or selling any alcoholic beverage in the state as a result of the Defendants' violations of the license provision.  Additionally, the defendants agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and to the imposition of a $25,000 officer- and director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The Defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the issuance of a permanent injunction against further violations of these provisions.\u00c2\u00a0 The Defendants agreed not to violate the federal laws, to the permanent injunction, to pay the civil penalties and to a hearing"
