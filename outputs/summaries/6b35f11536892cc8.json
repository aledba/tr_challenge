  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Analytica Bio-Energy Corp., a Delaware-based microcap company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Douglas G. Murdock, who acted as the company's de facto officer and manager, fraudulently obtained for his own companies 1.5 million shares of unregistered securities in connection with work they were contracted to perform.  According to the complaint, Murdock then transferred these unregistered shares to an associate who set up a brokerage account to hold the shares.  Murdock also allegedly misled investors regarding Brasil's control and management of the company and his own role managing the company.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Murdock caused the shares' value to drop from at least $1 per share in 2014 to less than a penny in March 2018, when the shares were sold to the public market at a price ranging from $1.00 to $2.18 per share.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's action, Murdocks consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $340,369.57, plus prejudgment interest of $49,009.26, and a civil penalty of $160,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David J. Guerrero and Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
