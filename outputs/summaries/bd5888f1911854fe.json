  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Second Judicial District of Mississippi yesterday entered a final judgment against Jason Walton, a former state trooper for the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, for his role in an automobile accident reconstruction case.  The SEC's complaint alleges that on April 7, 2013, Thompson was involved in a motor-vehicle collision in the parking lot of a privately owned gas-station parking lot in Biloxi, Mississippi. According to the complaint, Holliman's Chevrolet Silverado and attached trailer collided with Thompson's Nissan Maxima as Holliman was driving through the gas-pump bay and as Thompson was exiting the lot. The complaint further alleges that Walton failed to identify the foundation for his opinion or to base it on reliable facts or data. The court found that Walton's methodology of \"observing the speed of \u2024 vehicles [in the] gas pump bays and calculating an average speed fails to \u2024 give consideration to the tow load of both vehicles at the collision site, \u2024 compare the tested vehicles with the vehicles of the parties, and adequately describe the conditions of the parking lots.\u201d The court also found no evidence that Holliman failed to maintain a proper lookout in a situation that required a heightened level of awareness.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Walton. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Crash Task Force.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mississippi State Police, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
