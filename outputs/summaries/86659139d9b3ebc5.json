  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the estate's motion for summary judgment in a bankruptcy case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, alleges that Hugo Bustamante Jr., the sole shareholder and president of a closely-held corporation, Carlube, Inc., filed for bankruptcy in February 2013.  According to the complaint, in a reorganization proceeding that was subject to court approval, the defendants failed to timely file a plan of reorganization with the court.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, despite having signed an engagement contract for legal services on behalf of the debtor, the bankruptcy trustee did not approve the reorganization plan.  As alleged, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the parties should be equitably barred from using a judicial estoppel defense to the claims.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Additionally, the judgment orders the Defendants to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount owed to the parties in the bankruptcy proceeding.  On May 5, 2019, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Currid granted the Defendants' request for a preliminary injunction and ordered them to cease and desist from making material misrepresentations to the court in their filings with the Commission on Economic and Risk Analysis.  Currid also granted the defendants a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.    The Court also issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the estate and to issue an asset freeze to prevent any further violations of the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Section 13(b)(2) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Banking and Securities, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
