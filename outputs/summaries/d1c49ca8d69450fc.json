  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment in favor of retail salespeople who are paid entirely in commissions or draws (i.e., advances on commissions) in order to receive additional overtime or Sunday pay pursuant to G.L. c. 151, \u00a7 1A (overtime statute), and G. L. C. 136, \u00a7 6 (Sunday pay statute).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Boston, Massachusetts, one hundred percent commission employees working as salespeople at retail stores were entitled to separate and additional compensation for overtime hours worked when the employee was paid at a rate that equal to or greater than the regular rate for all hours worked over forty hours or on Sunday.  The complaint alleges that, had they known they were obliged to pay overtime, they would have paid the employee a lower wage when those payments were made for a different purpose.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against the employees for their roles in the alleged violations of the wage and overtime laws.

Investors can quickly and easily check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment by using the free and simple search tool on investor.gov to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, if a salesperson works more than forty hours in a given work week, she or he would receive an additional $125 daily recoverable draw, which is equal to the employee's regular rate or at least 1.5 times the minimum wage for any hours worked beyond forty hours.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants agreed to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206 of 1940. The final judgments also require the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlements are subject to court approval. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Mascianica and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson."
