  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a former officer of the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command for his role in an alleged sexual assault.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Moline, Illinois, alleges that, on July 12, 2008, former officer Johnathon R. Bever entered a guilty plea in a criminal sexual assault case.  According to the complaint, from July 12 through July 13, 2016, defendant Adam R. Struve, who was a private in the Army at the time, went to a party with K.R. and told her that he would like to have sexual intercourse with her. The complaint further alleges that after the party, the defendant allegedly asked one of the other men to remove her tampon, which he did not do, and the other man tried to put his penis in her mouth. The SEC alleges that the defendant replied, \"No, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to finish basic training in five years.\"  The complaint also alleges that defendant failed to disclose to his son that he had been drafted into the Army and enlisted in the unit that drafted him.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, plus prejudgment interest of $2,065, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation of the alleged misconduct. The receiver has agreed to be enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted an asset freeze and other emergency relief, including an officer-and-director bar, to prevent future misconduct in the field of law enforcement.  On August 2, 2017, the court granted the court's request for a temporary restraining order against defendant and ordered him to sign a second form waiving his Miranda rights, ordering him to return to duty on September 5, 2017. The court also granted the request for an officer and director bar, ordering the receiver to be present and to provide a copy of the final judgment as to liability for the conduct of the receiver. The jury deliberated for about 45 minutes before finding"
