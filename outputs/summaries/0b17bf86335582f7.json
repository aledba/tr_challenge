  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of a California-based attorney who successfully brought an emergency action to halt an administrative proceeding against her.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Bernardino, California on May 27, 2014, alleges that attorney Seth Gorman of Middlebrook, Calif., filed an emergency motion in support of a motion to revoke a court order that ordered him to pay $15,000 in fees and $1,282.40 in other fees. The court found that Gorman was entitled to fees under Section 1021.5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he had failed to adequately represent his clients in reviewing the fee award. The complaint further alleges that the court found Gorman eligible for fees on the basis of insufficient evidence to support his claim. The SEC also found that, contrary to Gorman\u2019s representations, Gorman had not performed a very good job preparing the case for trial, and had submitted a written declaration contradicting the Department of Justice findings.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in a parallel action, the court granted Gorman a temporary restraining order preventing him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019S complaint, Gomon and Weissburg consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating these provisions. The final judgments also require Gorman to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his fees.  Gorman has agreed to settle the SEC action by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for December 12, 2014 for Gorman and Gorman, who are scheduled to appear in court on the same day as Gorman. The hearing will be conducted by the SEC and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
