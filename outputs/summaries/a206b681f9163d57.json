  "summary": "On December 6, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of aggravated cruelty to animals.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, on December 5, 2017, a defendant and his adult nephew bought a puppy who, by the time of the incident in question, had grown to weigh approximately 30 pounds.  The complaint alleges that the defendants used negative reinforcement, including promptly \"paddling\" or \"popping\" the dog on his rear end with an open hand after an unwanted behavior, then placing him in his crate for a time out.  As alleged in the complaint, the dog bit the nephew's thumb, causing him to lose consciousness, and the dog died shortly after.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On December 7, 2018 in federal district court in Manhattan, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, charging the defendant with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $25,000.  A hearing scheduled for January 24, 2019, was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. Eastern.  Judge Timothy J. Mascianica granted the Commission's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws and orders the Commission to conduct a conduct-based investigation that will be conducted by the Division of Criminal Justice and the Office of the Chief of the Department of Justice. The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Office of Inspector General's Retail Strategy Task Force."
