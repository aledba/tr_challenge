  "summary": "The Kentucky Retirement Systems (KERS) Board of Trustees today announced that it has issued a final judgment against Veronica Bradley, a Kentucky resident who was denied disability retirement benefits by the KERS Board of Directors.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky, Bradley was denied benefits based on her claims that she suffered from Lyme disease and fibromyalgia.  The complaint alleges that Bradley was permanently incapacitated by Lyme disease, which she claimed had remained dormant from a tick bite in 2004, and that her Lyme disease diagnosis was inconsistent with the Board\u2019s recommendation.  Bradley also alleges that the Board improperly stepped into the shoes of her doctors, reevaluating her medical records and reports without the proper expertise to determine whether she was competent to perform her job duties.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney General's Office for the Middle District of Kentucky today announced criminal charges against Bradley.   The SEC's order against Bradley, which was issued on March 31, 2015, permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty equal to her disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and bars her from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Bradley consented to the entry of the final judgment, which, on a joint and several basis, prohibits her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after twelve months of employment, and requires her to provide assistance with lifting and moving and relieving her of supervisory duties. The final judgment also orders Bradley to pay civil penalties of $1,000,000 and a $500,000 civil penalty, both of which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  On a related administrative proceeding, the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office issued an order suspending Bradley from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an independent due to her alleged history and symptoms of Lyme disease.  It also ordered Bradley to provide a copy of the medical evidence contained in the medical records.  As part of the settlement, Bradley agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, to be barred from serving in the SEC, and to be ordered to pay an officer and director bar in the amount of $10,000.  To settle the SEC case, Bradley also agreed to a five-year bar and to a six-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting her from associating with any third party"
