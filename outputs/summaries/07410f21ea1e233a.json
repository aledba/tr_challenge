  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment in favor of terminating the parental rights of eight children.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that from 2001 through 2016, the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services received and investigated several referrals about Mother. The complaints alleged that, among other things, that she was repeatedly left to care for her children and that the aunt \"trie[d] to whip him and his siblings all the time.\" The complaint also alleges that, in one instance, Mother was ticketed because she was not properly restrained in her vehicle. In another instance, the complaint alleges that Mother took the children away from her mother and left them with her aunt, who had been in and out of behavioral hospitals. The complaint further alleges that she did not regularly visit or maintain significant contact with the children after she was removed from the department's custody.  According to the complaint, the children were very behind academically, but their grades greatly improved after they were removed from her custody. In a third case, the court found that Mother violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Mother, and ordered her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mother.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in this case, Mother consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, imposes a $10,000 civil penalty, and requires her to return to her mother's residence. The order also prohibits her from associating with any person with a history of substance abuse or with any other person with whom she has had an ongoing relationship. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being handled by Jennifer C. Barry and Eric Werner of the Fort Worth Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Dallas Police Department, and the Dallas County Office of Child and Family Education and Advocacy."
