  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a temporary restraining order against Thomas Thompson for failing to comply with a court order requiring him to participate in a debtor's examination.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Thompson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1826 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Thompson was in contempt of a federal court for violating the asset freeze provisions of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Thompson arising from his failure to cooperate with the SEC's investigation of a long-sunken merchant shipwreck and recovering the gold coins.  On November 27, 2017, the district court ruled that Thompson could cure his contempt by agreeing to a second hearing in which he would be required to provide information regarding the location of the gold strike commemorative coins and to provide an accounting of the value of the coins recovered.

Additionally, Thompson agreed to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and to the appointment of a receiver pursuant to the federal district court's Rules of Practice.

In addition, Thompson has been ordered to provide a written declaration under oath to show cause why the court should not hold him in contempt for failure to fulfill the obligations of his plea agreement.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, Criminal Case No. 6, Criminal Court No. 13, Criminal Trial No. 15-4424 (Nov. 21, 2015).  The complaint also alleges that, in a parallel case, Thompson violated Section 10(b) of Exchange Act Rule 10c-5, and that he violated Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, which requires defendants to provide truthful testimony in connection with the identification and recovery of assets.
