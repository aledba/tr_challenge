  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in a related action brought by Sierra Club.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that the agency improperly classified three of the 61 areas as meeting or not meeting the agency\u2019s criteria for air quality certification.  According to the complaint, the EPA improperly classified the area as being in nonattainment when, in fact, the agency had no reasonable basis to determine whether the area was in compliance with those criteria.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to what the agency claimed, EPA failed to adequately consider the evidence presented in the complaint.  For example, as alleged in the SEC complaint, as a practical matter, EPA had no authority to redesignate any area under any designation.  As a result, the SEC alleges, Sierra Club has no standing to respond to the SEC&rsquo;s and its petitions for review are not supported by the facts presented.&nbsp; The complaint also alleges that Sierra Club failed to raise its concerns with the agency about the accuracy of its analysis of the air quality data collected by the agency.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the agency from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the agency to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Additionally, the court has ordered the SEC to conduct an independent review of the matter.  On June 22, 2010, EPA issued a new standard for ambient air quality monitoring, or SO2, that imposed a ceiling of 75 parts per billion, based on the three-year average of 1-hour daily maximum concentrations.  Last week, the Court granted the Commission's motion for a temporary restraining order against further violations of the federal securities laws, and ordered the Commission to conduct a conduct-based examination of the data.  To learn more about how to spot potential violations, see Environmental Working Group v. United States v. Federal Bureau of Investigation, No. 10-cv-01221, (Jan. 6, 2016).  The Commission has also issued an order suspending the issuance of an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver and ordering the receiver to provide the receiver with a copy of the information requested by the receiver.  This order also prohibits the Commission from issuing an order requiring the receiver"
