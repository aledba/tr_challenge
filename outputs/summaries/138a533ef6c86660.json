  "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting a proposed rule that would bar investment advisers from soliciting government business.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that the SEC violated Rule 2030, which imposes a two-year \"time-out\" requirement for investment advisers to determine whether a political contribution poses a risk of corruption.  According to the complaint, the SEC's order, which was obtained by the New York Republican State Committee (NYGOP) and the Tennessee Republican Party (VSP) on July 14, 2010, prohibits investment advisers and their affiliated entities from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the SEC\u2019s representations to the public, the proposed rule does not permit placement agents to solicit government business from certain candidates and elected officials.  For example, the complaint alleges that a placement agent who solicited government business without disclosing his or her affiliation with a political party would not be able to solicit contributions from a covered party without violating the First Amendment.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the placement agent.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders them to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $150,000, respectively. The SEC also has agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  On July 17, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC and VSP a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of whether the proposed Rule 2030 is reasonable and reasonable.  A hearing on July 24, 2019 is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  To learn more about how to spot potential conflicts of interest, see Litigation Release No. 598 (2014).  The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
