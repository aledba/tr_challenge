  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two defendants who were convicted of felony premeditation and deliberation in connection with an attempted murder case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that a jury found Ian Alexander Henderson and Zavier Michael Marks liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1387 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the jury found Henderson and Marks liable because they were not required to prove a \"reasonable probability\" that the defendant committed a premeditated and deliberate act of murder.  In addition, the court found that Henderson had a prior felony prior conviction for which he had been previously barred from further prosecution, and that Marks had \"facially not permitted\" to serve as a juror.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a five-year officer-and-director bar.  On the other hand, the judge granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the jury to consider the merits of the case against Henderson, who was found liable for the same conduct by the jury in the earlier trial.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1387 (2014).  In its order, the SEC also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the court as part of a litigated proceeding against them.  Among other things, the Court found that the defendants had violated the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Exchange Act and Rules 5(b)(5) and (c) thereunder, and ordered them to comply with the court's order.  It also ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000 and $2,500, respectively, for each of their violations of the charged sections of the securities laws.  As a result, defendants forfeited their right to participate in a jury trial, including the right to reapply after five years of incarceration.  Additionally, defendants were ordered to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty and to be restrained from associating with any person who had been convicted of a serious felony.   The court also imposed a $500,000 officer- and director bar against defendants who had previously been convicted. "
