  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Dolan McGinnis, a New Orleans man who was convicted of domestic abuse battery by strangulation, domestic violence battery, and false imprisonment.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, in late November 2017, Mr. Mcinnis allegedly beat and strangled his girlfriend, Rhonda Mitchell, at her New Orleans home.  According to the complaint, Ms. Mitchell told her friend Demetrice Hutson that she had been choked and that she was forced to miss work so that her injuries could heal.  In addition, the complaint alleges that as soon as she saw the victim, he began choking her, causing her to lose consciousness.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed on January 4, 2019, the jury was told that the defendant was a first-time offender with \"a history of steady employment as a nurse\" and that he had been a \"very broken woman.\"  The complaint further alleges that when the victim complained to her mother about the abuse, she jumped out of the car and confronted him, telling him that she did not need medical attention but wanted a police officer to come and check her out.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Complaint and the Court's Order, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000.  Additionally, the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 13(b)(5) and 13(a)(2) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder.  On January 6, 2020, the Court granted the request for a temporary restraining order and ordered a hearing on the matter.  To determine whether to impose a permanent injunction against further violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, the SEC requested that the court order a hearing be held on the same day as the hearing to determine the appropriate amount of time for a hearing to be held.  Finally, on January 13, 2020 the Court entered a judgment ordering the imposition of a five-year prison term, which is to be followed by a six-year officer-and-director bar.   The court also ordered the appointment of a receiver to facilitate the investigation of the alleged misconduct."
