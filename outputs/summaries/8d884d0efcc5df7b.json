  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 6, 2014, J.P. was the daughter of Alejandro G. and Marina G. Pyszka.  The complaint alleges that Alejandro, who was separated from his wife at the time, had a history of severe drug use and had resisted treatment or failed to comply with a drug or alcohol treatment program on at least two occasions.  As alleged in the complaint, Alejandro was a stranger to her and did not make a reasonable effort to establish a relationship with her.  Alejandro also allegedly refused to participate in family reunification services.  In a complaint filed in federal district court in New York, the SEC alleges that the defendant violated Section 388 of the Exchange Act by failing to provide reasonable services to a child who had been removed from his parent's custody.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Separately, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Alejandro and ordered him to return to the custody of his wife and children.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
