  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Rugger Investment Group LLC and Kevin T. Jennings, agreeing to pay $90,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in September 2015, Rugger and Jennings entered into a purchase and sale agreement that required Rugger to deposit a lien release into escrow eight days after the expiration of a 90-day period in which it was required to do so. The complaint also alleges that Rugger failed to comply with the terms of the agreement and failed to timely deposit the lien releases into escrows.  According to the complaint, the defendants' delay was a material breach of the contract because it required strict compliance.  In a parallel action, on May 31, 2016, a federal district court in San Diego entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Rugger from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also granted the defendants the right to seek summary judgment against the defendants.  On June 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of California entered a preliminary injunction against the Defendants from violating these provisions and ordered the defendants to pay a civil monetary penalty of $10,000 each.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000, and imposing a $50,000 down payment.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael R. Kasper and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
