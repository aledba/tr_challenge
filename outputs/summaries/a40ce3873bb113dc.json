  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Hampshire today announced criminal charges against a former New Hampshire Hospital employee who was terminated for violating the hospital's sexual harassment policy.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portsmouth, N.H., alleges that, in 2015, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) terminated Steven S. Wilcox, an employee of Wilcox's who was previously terminated for the same conduct that led to his 2015 termination. The complaint alleges that Wilcox was terminated without admitting or denying the allegations in the PAB's first order, and that he was not given an opportunity to refute the evidence presented to the appointing authority prior to his termination. In addition, Wilcox allegedly failed to provide the employer with sufficient evidence to justify his termination, and, consequently, he was unable to respond to the employer's requests for a hearing on the merits of the case. The SEC also alleges that the former employee's 2015 termination did not comply with New Hampshire Administrative Rules, Per 1002.08(b)(7) because DHHS did not provide the petitioner with all of the evidence it relied upon, including corroborating evidence presented by the employer at the time he was terminated. The court's order against Wilcox also prohibits Wilcox from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization and from participating in any disciplinary proceeding. In a parallel action, the Department of Justice today announced that it would suspend Wilcox and subsequently terminate him. The agency's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Michele A. Boulay and Graham Loomis of the SEC's New York office. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Public Health Abuse Unit. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office, and the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 541:4 (2007). The SEC encourages the public to check the backgrounds of people who have been terminated by the agency by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General also encourages the use of the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission\u00c2\u00a0Advisers to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone who has been terminated for disciplinary or other disciplinary conduct."
