  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas yesterday entered a final judgment against Russell Aaron Hester, Jr., who was convicted of engaging in organized criminal activity and sentenced to ten years' confinement.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that Hester violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he aided and abetted Hester's violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  Hester also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.

As alleged, during the drug sale, Montgomery was able to obtain a scale, methamphetamines and baggies in addition to other miscellaneous items that he used to make the drug purchases.  During the drug deal, the court found that Montgomery was capable of delivering a large amount of the illegal drug, but he was not able to complete the transaction as required by the federal securities laws.
