  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against Raylon Castillo, a convicted felon who was sentenced to five years of supervised release for his role in a 2015 sexual abuse case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 15, 2019, Castillo was indicted on the charge of aggravated sexual abuse of a minor in Indian Country, New Mexico, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC alleges that Castillo violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the federal securities laws by failing to update his registration information with the probation officer and/or treatment provider.  Castillo also was charged with violating the mandatory pre-sentencing condition, which requires a defendant to submit to a polygraph examination before he can be sentenced.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico announced criminal charges against Castillo.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint, the SEC also charged Castillo with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder, and the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a civil penalty.  Additionally, the court has issued an order suspending Castillo from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged conduct of Castillo and ordering him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his supervised release.
