  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against MarketSource, Inc. and Allegis Group, Inc., a now-defunct Pennsylvania-based private arbitration firm.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia on Dec. 11, 2013, MarketSource's former CEO, Rachel Styczynski, was promoted by MarketSource to Sales Manager and District Manager and was later hired as an Electronics and Entertainment Lead.  The complaint alleges that she was pressured to sign the arbitration agreement because she was a college graduate with a business administration degree and was dependent on the employer, one of the world's largest jewelry retailers, for her immigration status and her \"very capacity to work.\"  The SEC alleges that, as a result of this pressure on her, she was unable to successfully present her claims to the court and was ultimately forced to resign from her position.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On December 13, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Kerstetter of the U.N. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Northern District of California issued a temporary restraining order halting the implementation of the arbitration provisions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  Additionally, the court issued an order requiring the parties to submit to arbitration a written consent judgment that would permanently enjoin them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to comply with the court's order, and impose a $25,000 civil penalty against each of them.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David Horton and Michael Corkery of the Philadelphia Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Hendelman.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Office of Financial Regulation, the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Labor Relations Board and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office."
