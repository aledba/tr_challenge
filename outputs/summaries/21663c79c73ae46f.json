  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Alabama Power Company and two of its subsidiaries in connection with an ongoing hydroelectric project in the Coosa River Basin.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that the SEC improperly obtained a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze to prevent Alabama Power from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the SEC failed to consider the significant environmental impact of Alabama Power\u2019s proposed hydroelectric power project, including the potential loss of threatened and threatened species in the area.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Alabama Power failed to adequately consider the impact of the proposed project on its members\u2019 use and enjoyment of the river.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Alabama Power and its subsidiaries have consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering Alabama Power to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against each of them.  Alabama Power has also agreed to settle the SEC action by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a temporary asset freeze, which will be subject to court approval. The SEC also has agreed to a settlement where it will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  On June 20, 2013, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Georgia granted the SEC's request for a temporary injunction and ordered Alabama Power, its subsidiaries, and its affiliates to comply with the court order. The court also granted the Commission's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and to impose a civil injunctive relief order.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Schlegelmilch. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Department of Environmental Management in this matter."
