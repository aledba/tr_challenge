According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan on July 17, 2014 and unsealed on July 24, 2014, the court found that, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the SEC was entitled to an exemption from disclosure provided for by the federal securities laws.  The court also ruled that, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC had the right to determine whether the records constituted \"personnel records\" exempt from disclosure.
