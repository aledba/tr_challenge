  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the former head of the National Security Agency (NSA), the former director of the FBI, and the former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  The SEC's complaint alleges that the bulk collection of domestic e-mail metadata by the NSA was conducted through a program known as PRISM through which it collects \"massive quantities of e-mails created by [U.S.] citizens\" \"directly from the servers\" of service providers like Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, and Apple.  The complaint also alleges that, as a consumer of various types of electronic communication, storage, and internet-search services, Schuchardt submitted affidavits in support of the plaintiffs in Jewel v. NSA, 965 F.3d 1090 (N.D. Cal. 2013), a separate case challenging the NSA\u2019s interception of internet traffic.  According to the complaint, the defendants provided no substantial evidence to support their claims.  In addition, the court found that the defendants failed to rebut the allegations in their affidavits and failed to determine whether or not they had a reasonable basis to challenge their factual standing in the court.    The court also ruled that, in a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New York and the FBI violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants agreed to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of $1,078.95, prejudgment interest of $2,079.95 and a civil penalty of $100,000, and ordering the Defendants to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David A. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Dunn. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) in this matter."
