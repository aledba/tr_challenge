  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Krueger International, Inc., a furniture manufacturer, and its insurers, Federal Insurance Company and National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, PA.  The court found that, on September 9, 2012, the contractor had failed to timely file its bill of costs with the district court.  According to the court's order, this violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  In addition, the court ruled that, absent an applicable exemption to the federal reporting rule, Krrueger's safe-place claim was not barred by the independent contractor rule, as set forth in Wagner v. Continental Casualty Co., 143 Wis.2d 713, 738 N.W. 2d 598.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the bar and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Wisconsin today announced criminal charges against Kruble International and his company, Spectrum Maintenance Services, LLC (Spectrum).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Green Bay, Wis., charges Kruble with violating the federal anti-fraud laws and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against him. The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and an order requiring Kruble to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wisconsin Department of Insurance, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
