  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who has agreed to be sentenced to life without parole without the possibility of parole.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boise, Idaho, alleges that Christopher T. Shanahan, who was fifteen years old at the time of the alleged crime, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, in 1997, Shanahan and two friends devised a scheme to rob a convenience store in Grant, Idaho and use the money to travel to Las Vegas, Nevada. The complaint alleges that, as a result of his actions, Shanahan's sentence was excessive for all but one of the defendants, Fidela Tomchak, and he was not eligible for the death penalty as a juvenile.  As a result, the court denied the motion on the basis that Miller is inapplicable to Shanahan's sentencing and, even if it applied, the sentencing court heard testimony regarding his age and mental health prior to sentencing him.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Shanahan consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The judgment also prohibits him from participating in any form of pre-judgmental or disciplinary proceeding and bars him from serving any prison term.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Shanahan.  On November 28, 2017, the Court of Appeals issued a memorandum decision denying Shanahan's request for a temporary restraining order and ordering him to comply with the court's order. The court granted the request for an emergency court order and ordered a hearing on the matter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Idaho Department of Corrections, the U. S. Attorney's Department of Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Idaho State Police in this matter."
