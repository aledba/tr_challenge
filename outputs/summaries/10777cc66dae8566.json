  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Utah today announced criminal charges against Utah's Department of Wildlife Resources (FS) for failing to respond to a request for a temporary restraining order preventing the release of mountain goats in the Manti-La Sal National Forest.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that the Forest Service failed to act on a request by Utah-based mountain goat conservation groups GCT and Salt Lake Forest Trust (GCT) to remove the goats from the national forest.  According to the complaint, the FS's refusal to comply with its first demand for the goats to be removed from the forest violated federal law and the agency's pre-clear and manifest intent to do so.  GCT's complaint also alleges the FS violated Section 704(1) of the federal Forest Service Rules of Practice, which require the FS to obtain a special use permit before releasing mountain goats.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in GCT\u2019s complaint, GCT consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the FS from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 706(2) and orders GCT to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of any monetary penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Utah today filed criminal charges and obtained an asset freeze against GCT. The SEC also obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of GCT, the Utah Department of Natural Resources, and Utah Secretary of State's Office.  This action, which is subject to court approval, is the latest in a series of actions by the federal agency to determine whether to issue a final order halting the release or destruction of the mountain goats on public lands.  Last week, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Utah, charging GCT with violations of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting GCT&rsquo;s violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rule 206(3) and (4)-8 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against future violations of the Exchange Act, and seeks a preliminary injunction against future issuance of any emergency relief, including an order requiring the release and destruction of any mountain goats located within the federal forests.   The complaint also seeks a court order prohibiting GCT from associating with any entity that does not have jurisdiction to manage wildlife within its borders. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The litigation will be led by"
