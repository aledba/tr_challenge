According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, Missouri on July 6, 2019, Keller Farms and McGarity agreed to settle a civil action brought by the Missouri Department of Agriculture (D.A.D.&nbsp;) in which the court found that McGarity violated the antifraud provisions of Section 537.340 of the federal securities laws and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.
