  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against a condominium association for failing to enforce its super-priority lien.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the Southern District of New York, alleges that, in 2007, Jon Michael Lucas purchased a condo\u00c3\u00a1\u0080\u0099s condominium unit at a foreclosure sale.  According to the complaint, Mr. Lucas paid almost six months of unpaid condominium assessments, totaling $589,750, when he sold the condominium to Ms. Liu, the new record owner of the unit.  As alleged, the complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to enforce their super priority lien, which is required by the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 1, 2014, the court granted summary judgment to the defendants and ordered them to pay $11,503.67 in delinquent assessments and related costs.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $5,195.28, and a civil penalty of $10,000.   The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal mortgage lien and to pay civil penalties of $15,000 and $20,000, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter in the Atlanta Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Office of the Secretary of the Department of Justice (DOJ) in this matter.
