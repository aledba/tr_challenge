  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the SEC against the defendants.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants improperly assessed common charges to the unit owners based on a formula that deviated from the reporting provisions of the Exchange Act.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to the defendants' representations to the court, Benson improperly spent a significant portion of the association's funds on repairs and maintenance of the condominiums and for paving expenses.  As alleged, the SEC's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of $126,766.11, prejudgment interest of $14,592, and a civil penalty of $32,500.

The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Kathleen M. Burns of the United States District Court in Connecticut issued an order imposing a temporary injunction against Benson and appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of any penny stock held by the defendants, and ordering Benson to comply with the court's order. The order also ordered the receiver to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver, which will be reviewed by the receiver. The receiver will be provided with the information necessary to determine whether it is appropriate to issue a judgment imposing a permanent injunction against violations of Section 5(b).  The court granted the receiver's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered Benson to"
