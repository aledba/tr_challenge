  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against a Maryland-based company and its owner in a civil injunctive action brought by the state.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that, in 2006, Brian and Karen Wynne of Baltimore City, Maryland and their company Maxim Healthcare Services, Inc., a Subchapter S corporation, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants claimed an income tax credit for income taxes paid to other states and so did not qualify for the exemption under Section 10.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to exhaust their administrative remedies for the resolution of tax disputes by failing to seek relief in the federal district court for the county or the city of Baltimore.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering Defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.

On the same day, the court issued a temporary restraining order against the Defendants from violating the federal laws, requiring Defendants to file amended Maryland income tax returns with the SEC, and requiring them to apply for a court-ordered injunction.   The court also issued an order suspending Defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of an administrative proceeding.  This order prohibits Defendants from acting as unregistered brokers or agents of any state or federal agency, and from participating as an unregistered broker or dealer in an offering of a security.  Additionally, Defendants cannot be charged with violations of Section 13 of the Exchange Act, and cannot be ordered to pay any civil penalty in the same manner as the Defendants.  Instead, Defendants can apply to the SEC for relief of their obligations under Section 13, and the court will determine whether to issue an injunction against Defendants' violations of"
