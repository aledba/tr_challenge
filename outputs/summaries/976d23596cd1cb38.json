  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against a former tax court judge for his role in a tax fraud.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, as a result of a clerical error, taxpayer's house has been overvalued since 1996.  According to the complaint, the magistrate's decision did not bind the department in the regular division of the tax court. Rather, the complaint alleges, the court improperly accepted the property values that taxpayer requested for the two most recent tax years but did not order the department to adjust the values for the first three tax years. The complaint further alleges that the magistrate made a final judgment that did not apply to all of the properties.  In a parallel action, the Oregon Department of Revenue today announced that it has filed an emergency action to halt the alleged tax fraud perpetrated by taxpayer.  To resolve the matter, the department has agreed to settle the matter by appointing a receiver to determine the amount of relief that the department will receive from the magistrate.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the receiver has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The receiver has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.   The receiver also agreed not to be named as a defendant in an administrative proceeding.  As to whether the receiver will be named the defendant in that proceeding, the SEC has not agreed to the appointment of a receiver, and the receiver is not required to comply with the district court's order.  Finally, the district attorney's office agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Oregon Office of Inspector General in this matter."
