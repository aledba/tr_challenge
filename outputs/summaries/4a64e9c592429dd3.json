  "summary": "On March 15, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against Intellia Therapeutics, Inc., a medical research organization founded by Eli and Edythe Broad, that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1782 of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Boston, Massachusetts, alleges that, on October 5, 2012, the court granted the company's request for discovery under \u00a7 1782 for certain \"methods and compositions\" for programmable genome editing of mammalian cells.  According to the complaint, Schlich, as a party opposing discovery, had the burden of establishing, by authoritative proof, that the foreign tribunal would not be receptive to the discovery sought.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Schlich had failed to convince the court that he was entitled to discovery because he was not a party in the foreign proceeding.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the company has agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the anti-divergent provisions of Sections 1782 and 1782(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Eric R. Werner and Patrick J. McCluskey of the Boston Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner, Ms. Klotz, and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
