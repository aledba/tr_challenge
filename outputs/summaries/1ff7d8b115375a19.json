  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against MCG S. LLC, a Utah-based real estate development company, in a civil injunctive action brought by Veracity Networks LLC.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that MCG violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, MCG failed to show that it was entitled to attorney fees under the indemnification provision of the lease and failed to pay its rent.  MCG's complaint alleges that the district court improperly awarded attorney fees to MCG in violation of that provision, and that the court improperly granted MCG the right to an attorney fee without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company.    In its complaint, the SEC alleges that, based on the defendants\u2019 written statements and the facts of the matter presented in the SEC\u2019s complaint, that the defendants violated the federal securities laws and that they violated Section 15(b)(5) and 16(a)(3) of The Exchange Act and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and the federal district court ordered MCG to pay attorney fees in accordance with the agreed-upon terms of the settlement. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC also issued an order suspending MCG from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney in connection with an ongoing litigation action involving MCG.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Central District of California entered a judgment ordering MCG disgorgement of $5,168.72 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038.71, which is equal to the amount of attorney fees that Veracity has already paid in its prior and subsequent litigation actions. The court also issued a temporary restraining order, which prohibits MCG and Veracity from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer or as a party to an action brought to interpret the Lease. The SEC is continuing its investigation into MCG, and MCG has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the Exchange Act, orders MCG not to violate the charged provision, orders Veracity to pay a civil penalty of $2,500, and requires MCG pay a $500,000 civil penalty. MCG also agreed to the appointment of a receiver to resolve the litigation"
