  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of a Swiss citizen who was denied entry to the United States as a result of a Department of Homeland Security denial of his request for a Certificate of Loss of Nationality.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that defendant Gerald Lee Ferber, a resident of Switzerland, failed to disclose that the Department of State had denied his request to be granted a certificate of loss of nationality. The complaint further alleges that Ferber failed to state that the department had \"carefully reviewed\" the plaintiff's application and had \"several options\" to determine whether a final decision should be made on the matter. In addition, the complaint alleges that he failed to adequately represent to the department that he was entitled to a certificate. The SEC alleges that, contrary to the Department's representations, Ferber did not respond to the SEC's requests for a copy of his letter, and that he did not file a response to the agency's denial of the request. Instead, he allegedly wrote letters to those agencies stating that they \"had reason to believe that [the] plaintiff had] committed an expatriating act and was required to relinquish his [United States] citizenship.\" The SEC also alleges that the defendants failed to provide sufficient evidence to support Ferber's claims. The court's order against Ferber permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Ferber to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, plus prejudgment interest of $2,038.71 and a civil penalty of $100,000. Ferber has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC announced that it had obtained a temporary restraining order halting the issuance of any documents related to the alleged expatriation request. The order also prohibits Ferber from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service, and prohibits him from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Ferbers. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, Eric R. Werner, and Patrick J. McCluskey of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Werner."
