  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against a Shreveport man accused of carjacking.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on July 10, 2015, Irvin Calhoun, a resident of Mooretown, Louisiana, was charged by a state grand jury with carjacking a motor vehicle.  According to the complaint, Calhoun told the grand jury that he was going to take control of the car when he realized that the car had been taken.  Calhoun allegedly told the jury that, when Calhoun refused to give him the car keys, he would take the car and drive it to the liquor store and Circle K to purchase a pair of shoes for himself and his aunt.  He also allegedly demanded that Calhoun give him $300 in exchange for his car keys.  In a parallel action, the federal district court for the Central District of New York today entered a final judgment against Calhoun that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Calhoun to pay a civil penalty of 35 years to life imprisonment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint filed in federal court in New York, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Brady O'Callaghan entered final judgments enjoining Calhoun from violating these provisions, ordering him to pay civil penalties of up to 35 years and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty, and requiring him to be barred from the securities industry.   The court also ordered Calhoun not to participate in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, or any foreign country, and ordered him to provide a copy of the Complaint to the court as well as to provide an accounting of the amount of money that he has spent on the car.  Finally, the court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Section 10b) and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder and a temporary officer-and-director bar against him. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Jennifer C. McKinley and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U."
