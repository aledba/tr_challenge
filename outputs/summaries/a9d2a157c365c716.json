  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against Matthew McCarthy, who was found incompetent to stand trial on charges of first- and second-degree burglary.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 21, 2014, in the Spokane County Jail, Matthew McCarthy told the court that he had been incarcerated for two years and had been released from prison for a prior felony conviction.  The complaint alleges that, while in prison, McCarthy repeatedly complained about the state\u2019s treatment of him and the manner in which he was treated.  In one instance, McCarthy allegedly claimed that he was under constant abuse from jail staff and that his ex-wife and another inmate with a substance abuse disorder were friends.  He also claimed that one of the jail staff members had kicked him out of the house.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this was not the case.  Instead, the complaint alleges, McCarthy engaged in a series of verbal and physical attacks on his former wife, Kayla Gonzales, during which he claimed to have been assaulted by another inmate.  On one occasion, he allegedly kicked her in the face and kicked her across the room, causing her to fall to the ground.   The SEC alleges that Matthew McCarthy violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, McCarthy consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $500,000 civil penalty, and requires him to comply with an order appointing an independent mental health professional to evaluate his competency.  Matthew McCarthy also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public health institution.  To settle the SEC case, the court granted the SEC request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, and ordered him to return to the jail.  A hearing scheduled for May 24, 2016, was delayed until after the court approved the motion for a hearing on the merits of the matter.  During the hearing, the SEC requested that the court consider whether to order the release of Matthew McCarthy from prison and order him to be restrained and restrained from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to a jury trial. The court also granted the request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the securities laws and ordered the issuance of a subpoena"
