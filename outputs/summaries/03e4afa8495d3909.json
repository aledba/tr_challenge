  "summary": "On December 1, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Maria D. and Luis D. of Chicago, ordering them to pay over $1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, alleges that Maria D., her husband, Luis D., and their three children, R.D., D.D. and Alyssa D., were neglected by their father and a friend of Luis's.  According to the complaint, Maria and Luis told the court that Luis had molested them, and that he had moved back in to the home two months earlier.  In a letter to Maria's mother, the complaint alleges that she confronted Luis about the alleged abuse and confronted him about it, telling him that she did not believe the specific allegations of the complaint.  Maria also allegedly told her mother that she had been abused by her father, a boyfriend, a female acquaintance, and a foster parent.  She also allegedly claimed that her uncle had shot a BB gun at her mother, which resulted in her hospitalization and the loss of her life.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Maria, Luis, and their mother consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and order Maria to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,500.  Separately, the SEC announced that it had obtained a court order freezing Maria D.'s assets and barring her from serving as an officer or director of a public school, freezing Maria's assets and prohibiting her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the United States.  On December 2, 2016, the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordered Maria to comply with the court's order by consenting to entry of a judgment imposing permanent injunctive relief.  A hearing scheduled for January 30, 2017 will be conducted by Gwynne P. Gottschall and Glenn S. Gordon of the Chicago Regional Office, with the assistance of Trial Counsel Robert C. Hannan of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 30, 2016)."
