  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant in a civil action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina on March 19, 2019, alleges that City of Charlotte attorney Michael Tinsley violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the SEC alleges that defendants used the often-used practice of block billing to record time spent on litigation, including drafting motions, appearing at depositions, and depositing documents.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Mr. Littlejohn provided clerical assistance to Plaintiff's counsel.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Plaintiff was entitled to $1,671,376 in attorney's fees and $22,045.57 in costs.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission Report, the Commission found that Plaintiff violated the common core of facts, which is that a defendant is entitled to a reasonable rate of attorney's fee based on the experience, reputation and ability of the attorney.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 2463 (4th Cir. 2012).  The Complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by David Hensley and supervised by Eric Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Sumter and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Compliance in this matter."
