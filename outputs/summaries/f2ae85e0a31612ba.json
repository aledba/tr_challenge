  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Global Marine Exploration, Inc. (\"GME\"), a company that claims to have discovered and recovered the wreck of a French shipwreck.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida on October 5, 2016, GME and its founder, Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Aviles, raised the issue of whether the shipwreck belonged to the French or to the Republic of France.  The complaint alleges that, in 1565, the French and Ribault fleets of ships sank near Cape Canaveral, Florida, and that, upon discovery of the wreck, they were forced to retreat to the beach where they had been anchored.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against GME.  GME has agreed to settle the charges against it by consenting to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining it from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, GEM has also agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  It also agreed that GME will be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with GME's litigation.  On November 2, 2015, the SEC filed a complaint against GEM alleging that it had discovered the wreck and that GEM had failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claims. GEM's complaint charges GEM with violating Sections 17a(a)(1) and (3) and 17a-3 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John DeBry and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John Delgado and Mr. Delgado. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.K. Secret Service in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment."
