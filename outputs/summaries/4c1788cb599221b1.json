  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Donald B. Henderson, a former serviceman who was convicted of making a false statement to the Department of Veterans Affairs about his visual impairment.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Mr. Henderson and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $5,000.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Spokane, Washington, Henderson, who was injured in a motorcycle accident in 1984 while serving in the Army, made a series of false statements to the VA and the VA regarding the extent of his impairment. The complaint alleges that, based on these false statements, Henderson was unable to perform certain tasks due to his impairment, including gardening, backing a car out of the garage, and practicing lawn mowing.  In addition, according to the complaint, Henderson repeatedly reported to his VA and VA healthcare providers that he had a \"permanent condition\" that caused him to be permanently blind due to a permanent condition called keratoconus.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, that the VA's July 16, 2002 diagnosis was false and misleading, and that he did not report his impairment to the agency.  Instead, the complaint alleges, as alleged, that he made the false statement because he was not qualified to receive VA benefits based on the severity of his vision impairment, and because he could not reasonably rely on the diagnosis that he received from his VA doctor, Dr. Harshman.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the court, Henderson consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment orders permanent injunctions against further violations of the federal securities laws, and orders Henderson to pay civil penalties of $500,000 and $1 million, respectively. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Sjoberg.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in a business using the\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0Advisers to\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of people selling investments by\u00c2\u00a0using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0"
