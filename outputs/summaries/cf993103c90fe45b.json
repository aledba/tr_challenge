  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the parents of four children who were removed from their homes because of drug-related issues.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the father and mother-in-law, who are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, the parents were the only ones in the family to have been removed from the home because their drug test results did not support the termination of the parent-child relationship.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the father had used illegal drugs \"probably all [his] life\" and believed that it would be appropriate for his children to live with him even though he had not completed any of the court-ordered services and that he had never progressed to unsupervised visitation with the children.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the father to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000. The final judgments also require the court to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support the terminations of the parents' parental rights.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (Nov. 2016).
