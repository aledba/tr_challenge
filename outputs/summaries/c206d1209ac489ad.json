  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in favor of the injured plumber and his company, Mechanical & Piping, Inc., in a workers' compensation case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Loveland, Nanez suffered a traumatic brain injury in which he sustained permanent, disabling closed head injuries.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the injury, Mr. Naniz's injuries affected his ability to perform daily tasks, including banking, taking medication, and managing his money.  As alleged in the complaint, the conservator's and the guardian's services were not necessary to cure or relieve the injury.  In addition, the complaint alleges, as to the conservators' services, they didn't help care for or remedy the injured worker's physical condition, nor did their services provide therapeutic medical relief from the injury's effects.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David Bogue, Carol Murnahan, and John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Bogue. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Ohio Department of Insurance, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office.
