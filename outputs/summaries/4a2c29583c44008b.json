  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of Santa Ana, the Santa Ana Police Department, and the Chief of Police in an internal affairs investigation related to the conduct of two officers conducting a search warrant at a marijuana dispensary.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that, in May 2015, two Santa Ana officers participated in the execution of a narcotics search warrant on a dispensary. The complaint alleges that the officers let their guard down once they had removed all known recording devices before executing the warrant. According to the complaint, the officers continued to watch and record the officers' conversations even after the warrant was obtained. The SEC alleges that Doe Officer 1 and Doe Officer 2, both of whom are full-time police officers, let down their guard and began communicating with one another as they would in a nonpublic setting outside the purview of the officers and the city's enforcement actions. The court also found that, contrary to the representations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants did not have a reasonable expectation that their conversations could not be overheard or recorded. In addition, the court found that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 3303 of the Public Safety Officers Procedural Bill of Rights Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Court also held that, without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the Defendants violated the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and 5(d) the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws, and that the SEC is entitled to a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 26, 2015, the California Department of Justice announced that it had obtained a court order requiring the officers to produce recordings of their conversations before the second round of search warrants were executed. The department also instituted internal affairs investigations of each officer involved in the warrant service. The investigation was conducted by staff members and supervised by Assistant Chief of the Department of Public Safety. The litigation will be led by David A. Hannan. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Affairs Division of Criminal Investigations, the Los Angeles Police Department and the California Attorney General's Office."
