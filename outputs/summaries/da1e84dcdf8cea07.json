  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that David L. Braden, a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for two counts of aggravated murder with death-penalty and firearm specifications, failed to move for a waiver of court costs.  According to the complaint, Braden's conviction and sentence were final prior to the enactment of R.C. 2947.23(C).  The complaint further alleges that, prior to March 22, 2013, the trial court had jurisdiction to waive, modify, or suspend court costs imposed at the time of sentencing.  Braden was sentenced in 1999 to three years in prison for the firearm specifications and $50,000 in court costs, and a jury found him guilty of the same charges in 1999.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Braden.  On November 2, 2018, the court of appeals in Ohio issued an order suspending or suspending Braden from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to comply with the agreed-upon settlement, and requires him to submit to a court-ordered conduct-based injunction against further violations of the charged provision. The court also ordered Braden to pay court costs at sentencing, including any costs that were imposed after the date of sentencing, and ordered him to maintain at least $400 in his prison account or establish a payment plan.  At the sentencing hearing in May 1999, the jury recommended a death sentence on each of the three counts.  After Braden pleaded guilty to the charges, he agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations, and from participating in any future criminal proceeding. The final judgment also prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, from participating as an unregistered broker or dealer in an offering of securities, from soliciting or offering to offer to sell a security, from purchasing or selling a security in the securities of another company, or from engaging in any offering of a security. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Department of Justice in this matter."
