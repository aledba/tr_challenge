  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered final judgments against Woodlark Capital, LLC, a Texas-based private equity firm, and its affiliated entity, UTSA Apartments, LLC (collectively, the \"Debtor TICs\"), for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, on December 15, 2014, Woodlick and UTSA agreed to settle charges that they had breached their fiduciary duties by improperly acquiring interests in The Reserve, an off-campus student housing project in San Antonio, Texas.  The complaint alleges that the bankruptcy court improperly imposed a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze on the property, and that the settlement was not subject to the court\u2019s order.  In a parallel action, on January 24, 2017, a federal district court in Texas issued a final judgment that permanently restrains the asset freeze provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders the sale of the property to a third party, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  On February 23, 2018, the court granted the bankruptcy defendants\u2019 request for a partial judgment, which enjoins them from violating these provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amounts of $510,475.89 and $410,097.78, respectively, and imposes a $100,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting to these violations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws and ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov website\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also check the background of anyone selling investments using the Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov \u00a0Investors can also use the investor.gov app to quickly identify people selling investments that are not registered professionals, such as retirees, to quickly determine whether their investments are worth a certain amount of money.  For example, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Texas Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Department of Banking and Securities and Investments."
