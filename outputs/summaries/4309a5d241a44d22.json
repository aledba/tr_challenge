  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a former Wildlife and Fisheries Enforcement officer for his role in an attempted second-degree murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Jeffery Wayne Ross of Grantville, Louisiana, engaged in a verbal altercation with a man who was driving a Mercedes Benz SUV. According to the complaint, the defendant told the victim that he was going to kill him and that he had a gun in his hand. The complaint further alleges that the defendant then allegedly ran over the victim, who was lying in the middle of the road, and hit the victim's car. The SEC alleges that after the victim confronted the defendant about his actions, Ross allegedly backed up his car and ran over him, causing the victim to lose control of the vehicle.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on September 19, 2017 and unsealed on September 21, 2017, Ross was charged with two counts of attempted second degree murder and one count of aggravated battery.  In a parallel criminal action, Ross pleaded guilty to one count and was sentenced to prison.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Ross agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $5,000 and a $100,000 civil penalty.  On September 20, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Ross, charging him with violating the antiterrorism provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(5) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act.  Ross has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 15(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about officer-and-director ratios, see http://www.securities.gov/index.html.  For further information, see SEC v.
