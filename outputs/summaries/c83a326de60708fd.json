  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Sharon and Everett Thompson, a commercial fisherman, in a child support case.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Anchorage, Alaska, on January 8, 2018, the court granted Sharon a temporary restraining order and ordered Everett to pay $698 per month in child support.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Everett.  On January 9, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Everett, charging him with violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-3 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint also alleges that the court improperly separated a fishing vessel from the rest of the marital estate in violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and that, in the alternative, instead of using the property division as a basis for calculating the children's income, it improperly separated the boat and the other property in the estate.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to their respective amounts of income.  Finally, the Court granted Sharon an asset freeze and ordered her to pay an attorney's fee of $1,078. The court also granted her the right to reapply as an officer and director of a public company after five years of serving as an attorney.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alaska Department of Insurance, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
