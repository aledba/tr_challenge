  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a partial judgment against a defendant who has agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 1968, Ernest P. Pillsbury, Jr. of Oak Brook, Illinois, acquired a parcel of land south of a passageway that ran between two public roads. According to the complaint, the defendant had abandoned any implied easement to access the right-of-way because he did not have an implied right to access it. The complaint further alleges that the defendant's abandonment and frustration of purpose arguments were not persuasive because, as a matter of law, the defendants had not adequately briefed the parties prior to the court's decision to grant partial summary judgment to the defendant.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant for his role in the alleged scheme. The SEC also announced that it would conduct an investigation into the matter. The case is being handled by John R. Rymas of the SEC's New York Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Paul B. Sansone. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
