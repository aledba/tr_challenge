  "summary": "On May 20, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court granted the defendant's motion for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and a civil penalty.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Brooklyn, the defendant was entitled to a one-half interest in certain items of jewelry, including Maddaloni Jewelers, a jewelry business worth at least $3 million, and monthly maintenance for a period of 10 years.  In addition, the court found that the defendant made substantial direct and indirect contributions to the appreciation in value of the jewelry during the marriage, and that the court improperly held the defendant in contempt for her failure to comply with certain of those provisions of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $2,500 each. The court also granted the defendants' motion to bar them from serving as officers or directors of any public company, and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $500,000, representing 25% of the appreciation of the business, and $2.500 in counsel fees pursuant to Domestic Relations Law \u00a7\u2019237(c).
