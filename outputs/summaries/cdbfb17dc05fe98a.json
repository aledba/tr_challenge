  "summary": "On August 17, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma entered a final judgment against TAMKO Building Products, Inc. (\"TAMKO\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City on July 10, 2018, TAMKO and its contractor, Tamko Bldg. Prods., Inc., installed shingles on Daniel and Barbara Williams' home in June of 2007. The complaint alleges that the Homeowners purchased and installed shingle wrapping on the home, and the contractors opened the product packaging to show the shingle wrapped wrapping. The Homeowners allegedly agreed to the arbitration clause without having the opportunity to read the contract or to submit a warranty claim. TAMKO also allegedly failed to disclose that the contract contained an arbitration clause.  The SEC alleges that TAMKO violated the federal securities laws by failing to enforce its obligations under the contract. The SEC also charged TAMKO with violating the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and with violating Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"). The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  To learn more about arbitration, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01581-1. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.

The complaint also charged the contractors as agents of the defendants, and TAMKO as a control person for the violations of Section 5(b).  The court granted the defendants' requests for an injunction, a temporary restraining order, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of an order"
