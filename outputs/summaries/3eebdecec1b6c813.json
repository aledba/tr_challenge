  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Delaware announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on May 4, 2016, alleging that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that, in May 2016, EPA granted a one-year extension to a multistate nonattainment area for the Philadelphia Area. The SEC alleges that the EPA's decision was unreasonable and capricious because it relied on the self-certifications of states that had not yet submitted an application for an attainment-date extension. In addition, the complaint alleges that EPA failed to determine whether all states in the area were in compliance with their respective SIPs. The complaint further alleges that none of the states had complied with their own SIP, and that, as a result of EPA\u2019s actions, Delaware could not apply for an extension until all of those states had submitted applications for an additional attainment date. In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of the Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending the issuance of an emergency action order against the agency. The order temporarily enjoins the agency from imposing any additional enforcement actions, including an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, and orders the agency to conduct a conduct-based investigation. The court will determine whether to issue a final judgment imposing a permanent injunction against further violations of the anti-fraud provisions. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Philadelphia Regional Office.  In a related matter, the SEC's Office of Inspector General issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
