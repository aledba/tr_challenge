  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Sophia M. Krasinski-Dunzik, an executor of her estate.  According to the court's order, filed on April 30, 2013, the executor had waived all objections to the estate's private sale of real estate by failing to appeal from an order issued by an orphans' court in April 2013 approving the sale of three real estate tracts.  The court ruled that the estate was entitled only to a share of the real estate at issue, and that an order appointing an administratrix would determine an interest in real property.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against the executors.    The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, charges Krasinsky-Dunzak with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On May 9, 2015, the court granted an emergency asset freeze and ordered the estate to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of the estate estate's assets that will be distributed to the rest of the family.  As set forth in the order, the order also requires that the estates' court certify that it has obtained an order granting the estate the right to sell its real estate, and requires that an administrative proceeding be conducted pursuant to Rule 342(a)(6).  The Court also granted the estate a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, which will be instituted in the event of a default judgment in the future. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter in the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities."
