  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Ditech Financial, LLC, a New York-based mortgage servicer, for filing a proof of claim in a bankruptcy case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that Ditech filed a false and misleading statement in a motion for summary judgment on May 3, 2018, asserting that it was the creditor and the servicer of a note secured by an investment property owned by the Debtors.  According to the complaint, Ditech claimed that the note was owned by Freddie Mac, not Ditech, and that it had the right to enforce the note.  Ditech's complaint alleges that, contrary to this, the note had not been secured by the debtors and was subject to a lien held by IndyMac Bank.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's Complaint Bulletin, filed on August 28, 2018 and unsealed on June 19, 2018 respectively, the Court granted Ditech a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and ordered Ditech to provide a timely response to the Commission's order to expunge its claim.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On July 2, 2019, the court issued an order suspending Ditech from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney, and ordering it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,078, which Ditech has already paid to the SEC.   The court's order temporarily enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Benyamin and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Department of Banking and Securities, the U.N. Secret Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
