  "summary": "On June 21, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who pled guilty to taking indecent liberties with a child in 2009.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 2009, defendant William Lindsey was ordered to participate in the mandatory satellite-based monitoring (SBM) program by a trial court.  The complaint alleges that, when confronted by the trial court, Lindsey raised a constitutional objection to the SBM program and was barred from raising the issue.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for North Carolina today announced criminal charges against Lindsey for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Lindsey consented to the entry of an order that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and bars him from participating in SBM for a period of 5 years.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry in the Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
