  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Georgia woman and her husband in connection with a human trafficking case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Laronda Moore and Eric Robertson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to object to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Moore from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest.  Moore also alleges that Moore and Robertson violated Section 16-5-46 (a) and 16-1-7 (c) and Rule 16-4-7 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Moore failed to object when one of her co-defendants objected to Moore\u2019s use of the money, which he kept under his bedroom door or in the bathroom, as Moore had instructed.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia today entered final judgments against Moore, ordering Moore to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, and imposing a civil penalty of $2,037, and Moore to be enjoined from further violations of Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2)(A)(3) of The Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Moore consented to a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the charged provisions, ordering a conduct-based injunction, and requiring her to comply with a court order prohibiting her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a law enforcement agency. Moore also agreed to a $10,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-8-59 (1) (2017).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Atlanta Office of Inspector General, and the Georgia Office of Financial Regulation."
