  "summary": "On April 25, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a New York City-based social services agency for failing to timely respond to an agency's recommendation to reduce public assistance benefits.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance (OTDA) and New York County Human Resources Administration (HRA) issued notices to public assistance recipients who failed to comply with work requirements.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, HRA and OTDA failed to inform recipients of their right to a fair hearing and to avoid a reduction in their benefits. The complaint also alleges that HRA failed to notify the recipient of the option to end a sanction after the expiration of the applicable minimum sanction period by terminating the sanction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, and impose a civil penalty of $2,008. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Jennifer A. Barry and Mr. Beringer. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The Commission on Advocacy and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Health and Human Services in this matter.  For further information, see Investor Alert:\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange Advisors.gov\u00c2\u00a0On January 8, 2011, the SEC issued a\u00c2\u00a0Conciliation Notification\u00c2\u00a0requiring recipients to show good cause for failure to participate in work activities.  In a parallel action, the United Kingdom Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against one of the recipients of public assistance for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against the defendant."
