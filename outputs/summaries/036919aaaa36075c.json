  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment in favor of the state's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against a defendant accused of perpetrating an identity theft.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that, in 1999, the Oregon State Attorney General's Office (\"Securities and Exchange Commission\") filed an emergency action to freeze the assets of a defendant and freeze his assets.  According to the complaint, the SEC's investigation was conducted by Raul Ramirez, Gina Skinner, Raul Gensitskiy, and Gina Skinner and was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit in the Denver Regional Office. The SEC alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and the reporting provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"). The SEC further alleges that defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, plus prejudgment interest of $2,065, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Washington today announced criminal charges against one of the defendants in connection with the same identity theft that led to the issuance of the asset freeze.  On July 16, 2019, the Honorable Judge Richard G. Gershfeld of the Umpqua Regional Office issued an order suspending the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any security deposit in the name of the defendant and ordering him to surrender his passport. The court granted the SEC\u2019s request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary asset freeze, as well as the appointment of a receiver to facilitate the transfer of the stolen documents.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, defendant and the receiver agreed to the imposition of a permanent injunction and to the payment of a $10,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about identity theft, see Investor.gov."
