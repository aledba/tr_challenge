  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Moldovagaz, a company controlled by the Republic of Moldova, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that, from at least 1996 through the present, Moldova entered into agreements with Russia and Gazprom that provided for the purchase and sale of gas in the form of a joint venture. The complaint alleges that this agreement was not subject to any federal law, and that, in fact, it was merely a means of reorganizing debts owed to a third-party. In addition, as alleged in the complaint, the agreement did not permit the Republic to impose a \"superpower veto\" on the joint venture, as the court previously ruled. The court also found that, as a matter of law, the Republic has the right to determine whether it is bound by the arbitration provisions of the federal securities laws. The Court also ruled that, based on the facts of the matter, Moldovagaaz was not entitled to a right to participate in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any gas, and to pay its obligations under the securities laws to Gazprom. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced parallel criminal charges against Moldova.  In a related matter, on May 23, 2019, the Court of Appeals granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and ordered Moldova to comply with the court's order. In its order, the court also ordered that Moldova consented to the entry of a permanent injunction against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, as well as an order requiring the company to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000. The order also ordered the company and its affiliated entities to submit to the court a consolidated Memorandum of Law in support of its motion to vacate the default judgment, which is subject to court approval. The SEC also requested that the court issue an order appointing a receiver of the company's debts, which would determine whether the company was entitled to the same level of control as it had in the past. The Commission's order granted the request for an injunction against further violations of Section 5(b)(5) and (c) the Securities Act, ordering the receiver to provide a copy of the debt to the receiver.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the defendants consented"
