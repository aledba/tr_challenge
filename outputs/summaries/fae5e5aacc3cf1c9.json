  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New York-based company that filed corporate franchise tax returns for years 1997, 1998 and 1999.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that Michael A. Goldstein, the former Commissioner of Taxation and Fin., and his company, Lorillard Tobacco Co. (Lorillard), falsely claimed that their finance agreements were business capital and did not constitute income from \"investment capital\" under the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Goldstein and his firm misrepresented to the court that the finance agreements are business capital, that they generate income based on their specific contractual terms, and that investments in securities of a similar nature are not capital investment.  In fact, as the complaint alleges, they do not qualify as business capital as they are not \"investments in securities, corporate and governmental, not held for sale to customers in the regular course of business.\"  The complaint further alleges that the defendants misrepresented that their financing agreements were not business capital when, in fact, they were business income and not investment capital.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Goldstein consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the New York State Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against Goldstein.  Separately, the SEC announced that it had obtained an order appointing a receiver to oversee the collection and processing of corporate franchise taxes in New York.  This order is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael O'Brien and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office.   The litigation will be led by Mr. Fischer and Mr. Werner, and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in this matter."
