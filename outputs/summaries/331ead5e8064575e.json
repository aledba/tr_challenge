  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Alabama today announced charges against Scholastic Book Clubs, Inc. (SBC) for failing to collect and remit use tax on its sales to Alabama school children, teachers, and parents.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that, on March 25, 2016, the Alabama Department of Revenue entered a final judgment finding that SBC violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment also found that, in the alternative, SBC did not meet the statutory obligations under the federal tax laws, and that the department had no obligation to collect the use tax owed to SBC. The SEC alleges that the final judgment, which was entered on March 27, 2014, did not impose an obligation upon SBC to collect, remit, or retain use tax for the purposes of selling books and educational materials in the state of Alabama. Instead, the court held that SBA had a duty to collect use tax based on its activities and that it had an obligation to retain its employees or agents under contract with the state. The court also held that, as alleged in the complaint, the SEC had no duty to retain SBC as an independent contractor or to retain an in-state sales agent or representative under the applicable Alabama tax laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Economic and Risk Analysis (OIEA) today announced that it has filed an emergency action against SBC, charging the company with violations of the anti-fraud provisions. The OIEA's complaint charges SBC with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"). The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar. The complaint also seeks an order appointing an independent receiver to determine whether SBC is entitled to collect or remit the Alabama sales, use tax, and to pay a civil penalty. In a related administrative proceeding, the Department of Health and Human Services today announced criminal charges against the company, its officers, and its director of internal affairs for violations of Section 5(b). The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Attorney General's Office."
