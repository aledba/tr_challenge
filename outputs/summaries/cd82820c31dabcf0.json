  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New York City Police Department officer who was charged with defrauding his wife out of more than $1 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that on October 25, 2016, the court entered a temporary restraining order against Husband and ordered him to pay $16,000 in child support and $10,938 in maintenance and child support.  According to the complaint, Husband consented to pay the amount of his initial retainer, which consisted of $161,920 of income and a state income tax refund.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the Court found that Husband was entitled to a duty use exception for his firearms and possession of the parties' Mercedes-Benz, and that he was entitled for a 50% reimbursement of his wife's counsel fees.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against him.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the officer and director of the New York Police Department's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also use the SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly and easily search for investor information.
