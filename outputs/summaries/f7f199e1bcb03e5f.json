  "summary": "On April 2, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Illinois entered a final judgment in favor of the city of Markham, Illinois, against a citizen who filed a petition to have his name placed on the ballot as a candidate for the office of alderman of a municipal government.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Chicago, Kenneth Muldrow, Jr., a former police officer with the Village of North Riverside, filed a complaint in December 2018 alleging that he was not qualified to serve as a municipal officer because he held a position as an adjunct faculty member in the city's police department.  The court also ruled that, contrary to what the court had previously ruled, the city was incompatible with having a police officer on its board of trustees.  In its judgment, the court held that the city is incompatible with a municipal board, and that a person who is not qualified for that office should be barred from serving as an officer.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the district has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the city from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the district to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The case was investigated by the Chicago Regional Office's Office of Inspector General, and the case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Agpawa, Jennifer Coles, and Rondal Jones. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Chicago Police Department, the Illinois Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Missouri Department of Banking and Securities and the Illinois Attorney General's Office."
