  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana yesterday entered a final judgment against Monica Dycus, a former high school student who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Dycus.  According to the court's order, Dycus consented to the entry of a Pirtle advisory, which requires officers to obtain a search warrant from a neutral, detached magistrate prior to conducting a search of a person's home or vehicle. The court found that, prior to obtaining consent to a search, a person in custody should have the right to consult with an attorney prior to being asked to consent to the search. In addition, the court held that the search should be conducted in the context of a reasonable search, not as an advisement of rights under the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against the defendant. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Indianapolis, charges Dycus with violations of Section 9 of the Exchange Act. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson. The Court appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221. The Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage people to check the backgrounds of people in custody by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of unreasonable searches and seizures, including the potential for an officer to spot suspicious activity in the background of a search. \u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed an Enforcement Alert about a possible DUII-related drug test that was conducted without a warrant.   The SEC is continuing its investigation into whether there is any evidence of DUII in possession of a stolen vehicle.  To learn more about this matter, see Investor.gov/Investigations."
