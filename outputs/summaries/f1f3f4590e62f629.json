  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Guilford County, North Carolina mother who was ordered to relinquish her parental rights to her two children.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, N.C., on March 1, 2015, the mother of D.W.P. (David) and B.A.L. (Briana) David was placed in foster care for a long period of time without making reasonable progress in remedying her children\u2019s injuries. David suffered multiple fractures to the femur, anterior ribs and one posterior rib, and was placed on probation for twelve months. The complaint alleges that respondent-mother re-established a relationship with her new husband, Mr. Goff, and concealed the injuries from her case supervisors.  The complaint further alleges that, after learning that David had been abused by his biological father, she continued to withhold information about his injuries and suggested that the children's biological father had inflicted the older injures on David.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against the mother and father of the two injured children, charging her with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The court also ordered her to comply with a court order prohibiting her from associating with any third party, including a lawyer, for the purpose of recovering her children. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. B. Ostrove. The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the U.N. Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Health and Human Services."
