  "summary": "On November 8, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas entered a final judgment against the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in a related criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that the FBI violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the complaint, FBI agent Erick Jamal Hendricks contacted Hendricks after learning that an undercover FBI agent was targeting a Garland, Texas-based terror group. The complaint alleges that Hendricks immediately contacted Simpson and asked for his help recruiting members for a domestic terror group, and that Simpson and Soofi followed Hendricks to the event site and communicated with each other about the security setup.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, the FBI did not violate the discretionary function exception, and the agents did not engage in any acts of violence.

The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-cv-17 (January 7, 2016).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hendricks.  On November 9, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Hendricks, alleging that he aided and abetted the activities of the FBI, UCE-1, and another organization that planned a \"Draw the Prophet\" event in Texas.  To settle the SEC case, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the defendants' alleged violations of the anti-terrorism provisions of the federal"
