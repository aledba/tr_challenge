  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment in favor of a proposed fill and removal permit for The Dalles, Oregon.  The SEC's complaint alleges that the Oregon Department of State Lands (DSL) issued a permit for the construction of a new marine terminal on a site next to Chenoweth Creek, near the Columbia River.  According to the complaint, the DSL issued the permit without a finding that the project would not unreasonably interfere with the paramount policy of this state to preserve the use of its waters for navigation, fishing and public recreation.  In its final judgment, the court found that DSL had failed to consider the public need and the likely social, economic and other public benefits of the fill or removal.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, DSL has agreed to the judgment that it has the authority to issue a permit without finding a public need or requiring DSL to consider whether the project is in the public interest.  DSL has also agreed to a judgment that requires DSL to determine whether a project is for public use and whether it is for streambank protection.  On May 11, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued an order granting DSL the right to issue the permit.  Sansone's order, which was entered into by the court on May 23, 2017, permanently enjoins DSL from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders DSL to comply with the requirements of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The court's order also prohibits DSL from imposing a penny stock bar against anyone selling or offering an investment in a public water resource project, and from issuing an officer-and-director bar against any person selling or selling any investment in public water resources.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 541.825 (1989).  The Commission on Environmental Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling, offering or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint Bulletin\u00c2\u00a0on May 24, 2017.\u00c2\u00a0On May 25, 2017\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0the SEC filed a Complaint Bulletin with the Commission on Environment and Natural Resources.
