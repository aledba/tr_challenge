  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Jenette George, a former home healthcare agency employee who was convicted on two counts of violating the anti-kickback provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, George was charged in 2011 with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(2)(A) thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Rosner Home Health Care, Inc.'s violations of Section 13(a)(1)(A). George was sentenced to six months imprisonment and ordered to pay a $500, both by check and in cash, for referrals to home health providers. George agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. George also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization for five years. The court also ordered her to pay $500 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of her ill-gotten gains. George consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions, imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar, and bars her from participating in any offering of any type of health care services. George has agreed to a $20,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.
