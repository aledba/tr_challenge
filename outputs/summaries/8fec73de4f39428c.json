  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the Philadelphia office of the Secretary of State's Office.  The SEC's complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, the defendants failed to disclose to the court that the federal and state laws that require contractors to participate in a certain type of apprenticeship program are unreasonable, unnecessary, and capricious.  In addition, the complaint alleges the defendants' actions violated the federal securities laws because they did not apply to non-union contractors.  For example, as alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the federal law requires that all contractors participating in a class-action program participate in at least three years of professional development.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions, ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000.  Additionally, the court has granted the defendants a temporary restraining order and an order requiring them to return to the states to comply with the agreed-upon settlement provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Rules 5b2-1, 5a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder, and requiring the companies to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the penalty imposed by the court on each of the defendants.  On the same day, the District Court issued an order suspending the defendants from participating in any type of public bidding program, including public construction projects, for a period of three years, until the court deems reasonable to determine whether the defendants are entitled to discovery under Section 12(b)(6).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Philadelphia today announced criminal charges against the three defendants for their roles in the alleged violations of the federal, state, and local securities laws.  Among other things, the SEC also announced that it would conduct an independent investigation into the alleged misconduct of certain of the charged contractors, including whether they violated the securities laws, and whether the investigation was conducted by the Office of Inspector General and Inspections and Examinations of Pennsylvania, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services."
