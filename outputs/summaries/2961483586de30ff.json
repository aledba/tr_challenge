(\"Relator\"), a medical device company based in Buffalo, N.Y., and its affiliated companies, Alere Home Monitoring, Inc., and Cardiolink Corp. (\"Cardiolink\").  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo on May 24, 2016, Relator alleges that Alere and its associated companies violated Rule 9(b) of the federal securities laws by failing to provide timely and accurate information about at-home blood testing.

Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov website to quickly and easily identify whether they are registered professionals or not.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Health and Human Services (OHS) today announced that it has instituted an Office of Compliance Program Guidance for Clinical Laboratories (OCCDs) to detect fraud in the field of auditing and to determine whether to apply for reimbursement.
