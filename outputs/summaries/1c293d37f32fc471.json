  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Wright, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay $146,404 in restitution.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Wright, who was a member of the B & P Company, Inc. family foundation, created the Fore Fathers Foundation, a non-profit with the stated purpose of supporting church missions, to pay for Wright's children\u2019s tuition. According to the complaint, Wright used a novel legal theory that had no basis in the law to determine whether a charitable foundation should be disregarded for tax loss purposes. Wright also allegedly misappropriated money from the foundation for his own use. The complaint alleges that the district court improperly calculated the amount of loss stemming from the false tax returns.  Wright has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and provides him with the right to a permanent injunction, to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending Wright from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant. The SEC is continuing its investigation into Wright's role in this matter. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Office of the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Department of Justice."
