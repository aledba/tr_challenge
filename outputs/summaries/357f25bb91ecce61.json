  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two former mortgage relief services providers and their principals for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that defendants made materially false and misleading statements in connection with mortgage assistance relief services and failed to adequately disclose that they were collecting advanced fees from their customers.  According to the complaint, defendants also failed to disclose to their customers that they had incurred advanced fees that were not adequately disclosed to them.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Macey, Aleman, and Searns each engaged in a deliberate and reckless scheme to evade the Commission's obligations under the federal securities laws.  For example, Macey and Aleman allegedly took illegal, advanced fees in the amount of $18,716,725.78 from 1,089 consumers, not when the last advanced fee was collected.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions, orders them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes civil penalties of $1,000,000 for each additional $100,000 they received from the Commission.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the New York Office of Inspector General, the Philadelphia Office of Financial Regulation, the Boston Office of the Secretary of State's Office, the Chicago Office of Market Intelligence, the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, the Market Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center, the Office of Compliance, the Pennsylvania Office of Insurance Regulation and the New Jersey Office of Investment Education and Advocacy."
