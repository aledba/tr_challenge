  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against three defendants who were convicted of aiding and abetting the use of a firearm in a crime of violence resulting in murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newport News, Va., alleges that Joseph \"Bryan\" Brown, a resident of Newport News who was previously convicted of a similar charge, provided false testimony to a jury in a New York gun trafficking case.  According to the complaint, Brown and Kindell told the jury that Brown had advance knowledge that a codefendant would carry a gun during a robbery, and that he had accompanied the defendants to Joseph\u2019s home.  Brown also allegedly told a co-conspirator that he was going to the house when the robbers approached the front door and kicked the door open.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia today announced criminal charges against Brown.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000.  On March 13, 2019, the Honorable Paul G. Rymas of the U.N. Division of Justice issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review of the case. The order also ordered that the defendants be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any firearm in the future and that the jury be instructed to consider the merits of the defendants\u2019 claims.  A parallel action was instituted against Brown, who was convicted in a separate criminal case in which he was also convicted in the same criminal case and sentenced to prison terms of 10 years, 10 months, and 10 years.  To determine whether a jury should proceed with its investigation, the SEC requested that the court issue a temporary restraining order, which the court granted without prejudice, that would require the jury to determine whether to proceed with the criminal case against Brown and whether to issue a civil injunctive relief order. The court also granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 924(c)(1) and (2) and 10-year bars.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17"
