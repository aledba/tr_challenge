  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island today entered a final judgment against Nimon Naphaeng, a convicted fraudster, ordering him to pay $581,880 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Providence, Rhode Island, alleges that, in 2015, the appellant concocted a fraudulent scheme to obtain work permits for Thai nationals living in the United States.  According to the complaint, the scheme was conducted through the use of flyers and the internet, and the appellant claimed that he was able to obtain employment-authorization documents for the applicants by filing asylum applications from two Rhode Island addresses.  In reality, the complaint alleges that the appellant was unable to obtain these documents because he filed the asylum applications without the applicants' knowledge.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, the defendants' scheme was a classic case of \"jumping the gun\" when it came to restitution.  For example, the SEC alleges that in January of 2015, an immigration officer noticed that around sixty-four Thai asylum applications were filed from one Rhode Island address. The officer entered a provisional restitution order on the basis of the information contained in the complaint. The complaint further alleges that when the officer entered the final restitution order, the defendant filed a second notice of appeal, which was issued six days before the final judgment was entered on the docket.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Complaint and the Court's Order, the Defendants consented to the entry of their final judgments.  On May 3, 2017, the court granted the Defendants' request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the restitution order to be issued on the date of and after the court's order. The defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the issuance of a permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Defendants also agreed to be enjoined from future securities laws violations, and to pay civil penalties of up to $1.5 million. The court also ordered the defendants to comply with the requirements of the federal securities laws, including the mandatory minimum of five years of imprisonment, and ordered them to pay restitution in the amount of $1,500 to $2,500 per victim. The Court also granted the defendants the right to reapply after a hearing on May 3.  Finally, the Court issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney."
