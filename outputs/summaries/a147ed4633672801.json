  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment against defendant Lawrence Walker, Jr., who was convicted of two counts of child sexual abuse in the second degree, in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found Walker liable for one count of lascivious acts with a child.  According to the court's order, Walker consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his monetary penalty.  Walker also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Walker.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Iowa, charges Walker with violating Section 5. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Walker from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Walker agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, and to pay civil penalties equal to his pre-conviction monetary penalty of $10,000.  It also orders Walker to pay a $1,000 civil penalty."
