  "summary": "On March 27, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the University of Louisville and its former associate professor of biology, Dr. Christopher Frost, permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Frost to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $7,872, 402, and a civil penalty of $2,965.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Frost with violations of Section 4.5 of the Redbook, and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  Frost has consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In its order granting the university's request for a preliminary injunction, the court also entered a temporary restraining order against Frost, freezing his assets, and barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public university for a period of three years.  On January 28, 2020, Frost was terminated from his position as an Assistant Professor of Biology by the university.  According to the SEC's order, Frost agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a hearing in which he would be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordered to pay a $7.872 million civil penalty and a $2.865 million officer and director bar, and to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  He also agreed to a $1,972,503 civil penalty.   The court's order also prohibits Frost from participating in any disciplinary proceeding, including the appointment of a new dean or a faculty member. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Tracy Eells in the College of Arts and Sciences and supervised by Scott Frost. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Compliance."
