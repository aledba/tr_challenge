  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment in favor of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (DNR) against Jeffrey Meyers, who was convicted of boating while intoxicated in violation of the federal law.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 7, 2018, Meyers and two DNR conservation officers were conducting a \"saturation patrol\" on Lake Panorama when they observed a pontoon boat displaying blue lights. The complaint alleges that Meyers immediately launched his boat on the water and attempted to retrieve a fire extinguisher from the boat. Meyers allegedly failed field sobriety tests and a preliminary breath test, and was subsequently charged with violating the federal anti-fraud provisions of Section 462A.14(1) and (2) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Meyers has agreed to settle the case by consenting, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,038, which is equal to the amount of his civil penalty.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Meyers. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott Frost and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Frost and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Iowa Secretary of State's Office, and the Iowa Attorney General's Office in this matter."
