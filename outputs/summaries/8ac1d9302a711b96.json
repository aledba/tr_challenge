  "summary": "On February 5, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) that permanently enjoins the school from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, alleges that, from at least 2014 through at least 2015, UMMS violated the anti-discrimination provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-1 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Massachusetts announced criminal charges against UMMS' former dean of student affairs, Dr. Michael Kneeland, for his role in UMMS's alleged violations of Section 15(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 15a-3 thereunder and for his participation in the alleged violations.  UMMS agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering UMMS to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the court granted the university's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  On March 16, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in Massachusetts against UMass-Amherst, alleging that UMMS had violated Section 15A of the Exchange Act and Rule 15b2-1, and that the university had failed to comply with its obligations under Section 15B.  According to the complaint, the university also failed to provide a reasonable explanation for why it had not agreed to a reasonable accommodation for its former dean.  Finally, the complaint charges UMMS with violating the \" plausibility standard,\" which requires defendants to show that they engaged in protected conduct and that they suffered an adverse action.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, UMass agreed to pay $2,500,000 in civil penalties and to a permanent injunction against further violations of Sections 15A and 17B. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.
