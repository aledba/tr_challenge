  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Alexander Ulysses Chabrier, a Texas State University student charged with sexually assaulting a college student.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Marcos, Texas, alleges that, on the night of August 19, 2015, while watching a movie at her apartment with her roommate, Erin Ratcliffe, and her friend, Chabriers, he engaged in a discussion with the victim about the difference between penetration and contact and, at the charge conference, sought to obtain an instruction on offensive-contact assault.  According to the complaint, the defendant told the victim that he was going to get rid of the pictures, which were black and showed nothing visible, and asked the victim to \"put her phone down and take pictures.\"  The complaint alleges that the defendant replied that he did not know or should have reasonably believed that the victim would regard the contact as offensive or provocative.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against the defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of five years and a $10,000 civil penalty.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the San Marcos District Court issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering the defendants to return to their respective homes and to pay civil penalties of 10 years and 10,000 dollars.  A hearing scheduled for May 26, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment by using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges related to the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.   The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, and Assistant Director of the Fort Worth Regional Office."
