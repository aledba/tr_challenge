  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Gregory Ray Jones, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his role in a 2014 home invasion.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Jones entered the home of two brothers, Daniel and Ruben Peacemaker, and engaged in a series of physical confrontations with the homeowners.  According to the complaint, Jones's entry into the home was accidental and a \"knowingly\" unlawful entry.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Jones violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rule 206(3) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint or the SEC, Jones consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In addition, Jones agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and a three-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in a public place, and requires him to show cause and effect, including a copy of the SEC Complaint that was filed with the SEC.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the New York District Court issued an order suspending Jones from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to return to the United States to answer questions about his conduct in the criminal case.   In its order suspending Sansone, Sansone and Sansone also agreed to pay civil penalties of $15,000 each.  Sansone agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from further violations of Sections 206, 206, and 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and ordering Sansone to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038,768, and to be barred from the broker-dealer and investment adviser business.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 2014).  The complaint charges Jones with violating Section 18-1-704.5, the make-my-day statute, and seeks a permanent injunction against Jones from violating the above-mentioned provisions."
