  "summary": "On March 20, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of AT&T, Inc.'s (T&T) motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the company\u2019s assets, and ordering the company to pay a civil penalty.  The SEC alleges that, in 2014, Katherine Castor was diagnosed with clostridium difficile, an infection that caused abdominal discomfort and intestinal problems. She underwent successful left ventricular ablation surgery in September 2014. According to the SEC, however, Castor had a severe case of anxiety and depression and was unable to perform her job duties as a customer service representative. The SEC also alleges that Castor suffered from atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. The complaint alleges that the company terminated her short-term disability benefits on December 11, 2014. The court also found that, based on Castor\u2019d medical history, she was not physically disabled, and that she had a right to appeal the decision.  In addition, the court found that Sedgwick violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.    The case is being handled by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Department of Insurance, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
