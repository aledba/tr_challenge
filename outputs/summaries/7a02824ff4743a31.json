  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Keith Anthony Dozier, Jr., a former office manager at Calder Pinkston & Associates, a real-estate law firm, for his role in the September 2012 murder of Gail Spencer.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Doozier, who was previously convicted of felony theft by taking, told his co-indictee Tracy Jones, who worked for the firm as a secretary, that he would arrest his wife if she lied to him about her husband\u2019s whereabouts.  The complaint alleges that Jones, as a defendant, was trained to complete wire transfers without permission, and had been trained to do so on specific occasions when authorized.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the defendants did not invoke this right by making any direct statement or request to the police.  Instead, the complaint alleges, they used a ruse to gain entry into the home and check on Spencer; they entered the home wearing ski masks and gloves and ensured no one else was home.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York yesterday announced that it filed criminal charges in connection with the case.  On October 5, 2012, the court granted a motion to suppress from the SEC the motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered Doziers to surrender his passport, and ordered the investigation to be conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-to-officer bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest"
