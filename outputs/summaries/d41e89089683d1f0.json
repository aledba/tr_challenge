  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, on November 15, 2014, while conducting a routine routine check-and-clearance examination of her mail, the defendant allegedly made several missed calls to Ms. Hollonquest's cellphone.  According to the complaint, the next morning, while she was checking her mail on the ground floor of her Manhattan apartment building, she saw the missed calls and called 911.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that the defendant immediately ran toward her and said \"I'm going to crush you.\"  The complaint further alleges that Officer Richard Davis and Michael Daly of the Metropolitan Police Department responded to the call and interviewed HollonQuest.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Davis and Daly consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties of up to $100,000.  Davis also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty in the amount of $1,500.  Daly agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of the anti-harassment provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and agreed to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, electronic security, or other security measure.  He also agreed that he would pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which would be offset by a $50,000 officer-director bar and a $10,000 penalty for each of the three counts of criminal contempt that he or she has previously been found guilty of.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kenneth S. Broun and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the New York Police Department, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
