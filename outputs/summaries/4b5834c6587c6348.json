  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Costco Wholesale Corp., a California-based company, for failing to withhold taxes related to lost wages.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that, in 1992, Costco paid a judgment to a former employee for improperly withholding payroll taxes.  According to the complaint, Cifuentes observed a front-end manager hugging a co-worker outside the store and reported the employee surreptitiously drinking three ounces of a beverage.  As alleged, the judgment required Costco to withhold payroll taxes from the award of lost wages, and the employer could have been held liable for any amounts withheld by the employer.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the company failed to pay back the $9,975.37 it owed to the former employee, which was deemed to be owed to him as income and subject to income tax withholding.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Costco agreed to the final judgment, which permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay $20,060 in attorney fees and a civil penalty of $325,692.07. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2012, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered the company to pay a $30,000 civil penalty to be determined by the court at a later date.  Following the court's order, the company agreed to a settlement where it would be liable for the amount of back pay and front pay it would receive.  Costco agreed not to pay the civil penalty and to the payment of a $50,000 penalty. The company also agreed to pay an $8,500 civil penalty.  A federal district court in New York also issued an order suspending the settlement pending final approval of the settlement. The court also suspended the company's right to reapply for an officer-and-director bar in the future.  Finally, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the company, charging it with violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws.  It also instituted an internal investigation that is being conducted by the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, with the assistance of the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force. The litigation will be led by Marc Blau and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.
