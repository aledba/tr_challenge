  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a Deschutes County man for defrauding South Valley Bank & Trust in an effort to execute on a judgment against him.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 20, 2013, South Valley obtained a writ of execution and an order authorizing the sale of a real property in Josephine County.  The complaint alleges that, in 2010, Batzer obtained title to the real property and, for the next three years, he rented out the property and reported the rental income on NPT\u2019s tax returns.  In 2013, the court issued an order requiring South Valley to show that there had been any consideration for the property before the judgment was issued.  As alleged in the complaint, however, there was no consideration for that transfer, and, as a matter of law, the defendant did not record any conveyance from himself as an individual to himself as trustee of the property.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins South Valley from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  South Valley also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and to be barred from serving as a trustee of any real property for a period of five years.  On May 21, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action against South Valley, charging it with violations of Section 18(a)(1) and (3) the securities registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(3) and with aiding and abetting South Valley and its violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (d) the books and records provisions of the federal securities laws.  It also charged South Valley as a defendant in its action against the defendants for failing to comply with the requirements of Section 15(b)(5) and 16(a).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Halleck and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, and the Missouri Attorney General's Office in this matter."
