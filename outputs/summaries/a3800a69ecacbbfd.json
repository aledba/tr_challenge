  "summary": "On December 1, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania mother and her two adult children in contempt of court for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court granted the mother's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered her to surrender her infant daughter and non-custodial granddaughter, N.M., to the Philadelphia Department of Human Services.  In its order, the court held the mother in contempt until she surrendered her granddaughter.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, the mother and daughter were not in the home at the time of the hearing, and the court did not hold her in contempt.  As alleged in the court order, however, when confronted with the fact that the mother had filmed Q.R. masturbating with the intent to publish such video on the Internet, the trial court held her in custody until she surrendered her granddaughter to the Department of Homeland Security.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar.  On December 29, 2017, a federal court in Pennsylvania entered an order holding Mother in contempt for failing to comply with a court order requiring her surrender of her daughter and a six-month-old granddaughter to be held in her home until the court ordered her surrender. The court also issued an order suspending her from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney. The order also prohibits her from associating with any person who is not a member of the family with whom she has an interest in obtaining a court-ordered restraining order.  Separately, the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services today announced that it has obtained an order appointing a receiver to monitor the progress of the investigation. The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment using the SEC's Investor.gov website.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Philadelphia Police Department and the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office in this matter."
