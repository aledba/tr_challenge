  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Morgan Eastwood Eddy, Jr., a defendant who was convicted of first-degree murder in April 2016.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that, from at least May 23, 2017 through June 16, 2017, defendant Morgan, a resident of the apartment complex where he resided, engaged in aggressive, mutual hand-to-hand combat inside and outside the apartment.  According to the complaint, defendant initially agreed to settle the matter by agreeing to a guilty plea, agreeing to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed criminal charges against defendant, charging him with violating the Sixth Amendment to the Securities Act of 1933, Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of $150,000 and $100,000, respectively.  On June 17, 2018, the Honorable Judge Richard J. Mascianica granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order against defendant and ordered him to surrender control of the case to the court.  A hearing scheduled for July 26, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  To learn more about this matter, see the SEC Litigation Release Release Release No. 584 (January 24, 2018).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Los Angeles Regional Office.  For further information, see Lit. Release Alert No. 1512-1513."
