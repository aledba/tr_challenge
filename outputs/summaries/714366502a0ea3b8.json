  "summary": "On September 13, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that on September 1, 2016, while conducting operations in a creek bed along State Highway 12 in Starks, Louisiana, a cable was severed from a fiber optic telecommunications cable.  According to the complaint, Thomas Wayne Harvey and John Conner were present to observe the cut and observed the cuts shortly after in the course of doing work.  As alleged, Harvey and Conner corroborated each other's account of the cut.  In addition, the SEC alleges that neither of them was present to witness the cut in the cable when it was severed.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  On September 24, 2018, the United States District Court in New Orleans entered final judgments against Harvey, Conner, and Wilfong, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million and $2 million, respectively, for each of the defendants' violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and ordering Wilford to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Wilford agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged violations of Section 5(b).  The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1749.14F.  This case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related case, the Commission issued an Investor Alert about the potential for investment losses arising from cable damage.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted"
