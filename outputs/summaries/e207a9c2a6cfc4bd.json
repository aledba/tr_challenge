  "summary": "On May 5, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) v. Nissan, finding that the TLC exceeded its authority and exceeded its statutory duties in promulgating rules about the design and operation of taxis.  The court also found that, contrary to the Commission's representations, the city did not exceed its authority or violate the separation of powers doctrine by enacting those rules.  According to the court's order, the TCL exceeded its delegated authority under the City Charter by requiring each taxi owner to purchase a vehicle that was specifically designed to be a taxi, not with whether all gas-powered taxis should be one model.  In addition, the court found that the City Council had the authority to determine whether a particular vehicle was permissible as a taxi without violating the federal securities laws.  As a result of the Court's finding, the Commission has largely left taxi regulation to the city council, with little or no interference from the legislative body.  For example, the Court granted a motion to intervene in the matter of whether the city Council violated the city charter by failing to act as a broker-dealer in drafting and promulgating the ToT rules, or whether it acted in a manner not contemplated by the city's proper delegation of power.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges the Commission with violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The Complaint also seeks a court order requiring the Commission to provide an accounting of the costs and benefits of a certain type of taxi, and to order the Commission and TLC to adopt a \"model or model\" of a taxi. The Commission has also agreed to the appointment of a receiver to assist in this matter. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DOH)."
