  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against defendant Ronald Q. Maas, who was convicted and sentenced on two counts of aggravated DUI and one count of driving while intoxicated.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on November 14, 2014, Maas was driving a Ford F-350 pickup truck when he was confronted by two officers who were attempting to pull him over.  The complaint alleges that Maas failed to report the crash and instead engaged in a series of high-speed chases and attempted to evade the officers. The complaint further alleges that, after the officers confronted Maas about his alleged involvement in the crash, he allegedly began to drive recklessly, nearly running over an officer, and attempting to steal the truck.  Maas allegedly told the officers that he had been shot in the jaw and was bleeding profusely.  In a parallel criminal action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Maas.    The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Eric R. Hall and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois State Police. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0report\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0you\u00c2\u00a0don't\u00c2\u00a0know\u00c2\u00a0about\u00c2\u00a0the financial condition of a person who has been injured in a motor vehicle accident.\u00c2\u00a0In a related case, the SEC today announced that it has obtained a court order freezing Maas' assets and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of\u00c2\u00a0$1.8 million.  On November 16, 2017, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Maas from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also ordered Maas to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordered him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Mr. Hall consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and imposing a $1,8 million civil penalty. The judgment also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security"
