  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Barton Stuck, a convicted wire fraudster who was sentenced to a total of more than 12 years in prison.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Stuck violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that from 2006 to 2011 Stuck defrauded his investors of about $8.7 million, with the lion's share of these losses occurring before 2009.  The complaint also alleges that Stuck induced investors to part with their money for his own benefit and to lull his victims into believing that he had devised a multi-pronged scheme that would result in a quadruple-enhanced prison sentence.  In fact, according to the complaint, for several years before, he solicited millions of dollars in investments until his funds failed in 2011, with large losses for many investors.

On the other hand, the Complaint alleges that, based on the nature of Stuck's prior fraud, he has a right to a jury determination whether the conduct that he engaged in constituted a \"relevant conduct\" under the federal wire fraud laws, and that he should be commensurate with the amount of money that he has already lost by the time he returns from the wire fraud.   The Complaint further alleges that in 2015 Stuck consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $50,000 civil penalty, and imposes a $75,000 officer and director bar.  Finally, the Commission has issued an order suspending Stuck from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to"
