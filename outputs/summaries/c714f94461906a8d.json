  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Mauricio Altamirano, who was convicted of second-degree criminal possession of a gun.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, in the course of preparing his summation of the evidence, defendant took a knife out of his pocket and swung it at the victim, causing the victim to fall to the ground on top of a glass bottle.  According to the complaint, after discovering the knife in the bag, defendant confronted the victim and demanded that he remove the knife from his possession.  As alleged, the victim refused to comply with the court's order, and, after learning that the knife was in his possession, he began to punch and kick the victim several times.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant told the victim that he had a \"connection to that\" gun, and that he turned the knife over to police at the first opportunity presented to him.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the FBI."
