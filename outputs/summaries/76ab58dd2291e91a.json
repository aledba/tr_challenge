  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont yesterday entered a final judgment against a Vermont citizen who filed for a no-fault divorce in India.  The court found that the husband was not a resident of the state, and that he was not entitled to a permanent resident visa.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Vermont, the husband entered into a temporary nonimmigrant visa in India in 2011. The court ruled that the visa was not subject to subject matter jurisdiction because the husband had lived and worked continuously in Vermont since 2011, had a Vermont driver's license, and had returned to India for only a few brief visits over the course of his years living in the state.  In concluding that husband was a domicile, the court allowed him to apply for and receive his I\u2013140 visa, which was subject to renewal every two years for an indefinite period of time.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2017.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the U.N. Division of Justice granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Mr. Sansome. The case has been supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Vermont Office of Immigration and Citizenship, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Vermont Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
