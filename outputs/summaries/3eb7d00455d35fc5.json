  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered final judgments in favor of Forrest P. Wall, M.D., F.A.C. and Ambulatory Surgery Center of Louisiana, L.L.C., in connection with Wall's imminent disqualification as a member of ASC and the forced sale of his ownership interest in ASC.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Caddo, Louisiana, on April 15, 2015, Wall, a certified public accountant, and a certified financial analyst, entered into an agreement that stipulated that in order to maintain ownership in ASC, a person must maintain full and unrestricted privileges on the professional staff as well as on ASC's professional staff. The settlement agreement also required that the value of Dr. Wall's interest be calculated in accordance with the fair market value of the stock.  The SEC alleges that, in reality, the settlement agreement did not apply to all of Wall's interests in ASC because it did not require the use of a \"minority discount\" and instead required that all of the discounts applied to the stock be based on fair market values.  In addition, the court found that Neiberg was not a credible, qualified, and reliable expert in determining the fair value of a stock when, in fact, the stock was not fair at all.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Wall consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $673.819.00 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also ordered that he pay a $75,000 civil penalty in the amount of $873,146.00, which is equal to the civil penalty imposed by the court on him in the earlier case. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Steven G. Durio and Ms. Ritter. The case is being supervised by Gregory W. Bryan, DPM, and Michelle R.Ritter, who will lead the litigation.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Louisiana Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Louisiana Attorney General's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the\u00c2"
