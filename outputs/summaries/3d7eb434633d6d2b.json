  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Lerone \"Slim\" Lewis, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to twenty years in prison for a second felony conviction in 2008.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Lewis violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Lewis was in a romantic relationship with a second defendant and, on August 4, 2017, he slashed Victim's throat with a box cutter while she was waiting for a church member to pick her up for church service. The complaint alleges that, as a second offender, Defendant was exposed to a sentence of imprisonment for not less than one-half the length of a first conviction and not more than twice the longest term of a third conviction.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Lewis failed to seek a supervisory review of his sentence, and instead consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Lewis.  On November 13, 2018, the SEC filed a multiple bill against Lewis, which was denied by the court. On December 12, 2019, the district court vacated the earlier judgments against Lewis and sentenced him to ten years with credit for time served. On January 24, 2020, the court granted a preliminary injunction against Lewis from further violations of these provisions, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The court also issued an order suspending Lewis from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Lewis agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged sections of the securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and appointing a receiver to oversee the proceedings. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about double jeopardy, see SEC Litigation Release Rule No. 17-14."
