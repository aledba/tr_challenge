  "summary": "On March 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri entered a final judgment against Douglas Dwayne Eubanks, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to twenty years in prison for his role in an August 2018 domestic violence case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that, on the evening of March 2nd, 2018 in a campfire in the middle of the road, Eubank and his friend Burns approached a man and asked him to identify himself as a person who was tampering with the property of another person.  According to the complaint, the man replied, \"I don't have to tell you fucking shit. Go away.\"  The complaint further alleges that Eubsanks continued to approach the man, telling him that he did not know who he was or why he was doing that, and that he was going to \"beat the fuck out of [him] if he could not believe it, determine it unreasonable for a jury to find him liable, and refuse his tendered instructions.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against EUBanks, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  EUBANK also agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations in its complaint, Eubsank consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  In its order, the court also imposed a $50,000 bar on Eubanking.  It also ordered him to surrender his passport and to pay $10,000 in restitution, which he will pay in the amount of $100,000, and requires him to return to his home and reside there for a period of five years, including a $20,000 officer-and-director bar.   The court will determine the amount and severity of the penalty upon motion of the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. McCole and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0"
