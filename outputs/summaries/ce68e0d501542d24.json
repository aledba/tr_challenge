  "summary": "On October 2, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against a group of school trustees who filed a petition to detach and annex their properties from DeKalb Community Unit School District No. 428 (the De Kalb District).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 29, 2016 in DeKalmb County District Court in Chicago, the school trustees, Audra Cronauer, Linnae Smith, and Dawn Styka, petitioned the Regional Board of School Trustees of De Kalmb County, Illinois, to allow them to apply for detachment and annex to the Sycamore District.  The complaint alleges that the district agreed to detachment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and that, based on the evidence presented to the court, the district was required, but failed, to consider the \"will of the people\" in denying the defendants' petition.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 12, 2017, a federal district court in Chicago issued an order granting the defendants a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the district to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson, John Rymas, and Amy C. McKinley of the Chicago Regional Office, and was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry and Kurt L. Gottschall of the Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson."
