  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the Gosnells, finding that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 150.002 of the federal securities laws.  The court also found that, contrary to the federal law, the defendants did not waive the right to dismiss with prejudice.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Fort Worth, Texas, Paul and Kim Gosnell hired Thomas A. LaLonde d/b/a Lee Engineering Co.; TAL Industries, Inc., Stanley Harold Prather; and Prather Engineering Consultants Inc. to evaluate and stabilize their home's foundation. The complaint alleges that the Engineers' work exacerbated the foundation problems, causing significant damage to their home. The court ultimately granted the defendants' motion for dismissal with prejudice, and the defendants agreed to settle the case by agreeing to a scheduling order establishing discovery and expert-witness designation deadlines and setting a trial date.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by the Office of the United States District Judge in the Fort Worth Regional Office. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Home Inspections and Examinations Unit. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Office of Inspector General in this matter."
