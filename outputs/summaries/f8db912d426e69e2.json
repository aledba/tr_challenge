  "summary": "On February 22, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against a defendant in a custody action brought by the Ohio Department of Juvenile Justice.  According to the court's order, filed on February 21, 2017, in Athens County District Court, Ohio, a defendant named Jarvis Bateman filed a complaint for custody of two children, A.B. and B.B., alleging that he was concerned for the safety of the children and that Appellee had recently moved out of the family's home, was living with another man, and had a known drug addiction.  The court ultimately denied the defendant's request for a temporary custody order and placed the children in the temporary custody of Appellant.  In its judgment, the court held that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $350,000.  Appelant also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest of $150,000 and a $100,000 civil penalty.  On February 24, 2019, the Court granted the defendant a temporary restraining order and ordered him to comply with the court order.  As set forth in the order, Appellemans has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge $150 million in illusory gains plus interest, and imposing a $75,000 penalty against him.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221, July 17, 2018.  Separately, the Ohio Division of Criminal Justice announced that it has issued an order appointing an attorney to represent the interests of the victims of the alleged abuse of discretion.  A hearing scheduled for March 5, 2019 is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  An examination of the records conducted by the SEC Enforcement Division's Office of Child Advocacy and Advocacy (OIEA) found that, contrary to the SEC's findings, Appelllemans was not properly represented by counsel at the time of the hearing and did not participate in the drafting of the OIEA's order. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and Patrick J."
