  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Veronica Aguayo, a California resident who was sentenced to three years of supervised release after a jury found her guilty of assault with a deadly weapon and force-likely assault.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against her.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on August 8, 2017 in the Umpqua District Court in the District of New York and unsealed on Dec. 27, 2018, the court held that defendants with mental disorders should be barred from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that defendants should be prohibited from using a \"deadly weapon\" or \"force likely to produce great bodily injury.\"  The SEC also found that defendants who had been previously convicted of these charges were not required to prove that they had ever used a weapon.  For example, a defendant who had previously been sentenced to prison for force likely assault would have been barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for three years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida today announced that it filed criminal charges against one of the defendants in connection with the same conduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. \u00c2\u00a0The court also granted the defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 245 of the Exchange Act and Rules 245-8 and 245-9 thereunder.\u00c2\u00a0 The court granted the defendants' motion for preliminary and permanent injunctions against future violations, ordered a hearing on the matter, and ordered the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and issued a civil injunctive relief order against the defendant.   The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the San Diego Regional Office. \u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Justice, and the California State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
