  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against the city of Mattoon, Illinois, on a civil injunctive action, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, alleges that Mattoon violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to adequately disclose to retirees that it required them to pay a higher percentage of their health insurance premiums than those paid by active employees.  According to the complaint, Mattoon also failed to disclose that the city was requiring retirees to make higher contributions to health insurance, as part of a contract, than the contributions required of those who were actively employed in the city.  In addition, the complaint alleges Mattoon failed to adequately state that it was required to pay any portion of the total premium cost of health insurance for active employees, even when the changes to the terms would cause employees to receive a smaller pension.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, ordering them to disgorge their gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On May 25, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert Zschau of the Chicago Regional Office issued a temporary restraining order, ordering Mattoon to comply with the court's order, and appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver's investigation.   The court also issued a preliminary injunction against Mattoon's violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and ordering the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver.  Mattoon has agreed to pay $1.2 million in disgorgment, $1,038 in prejudgment interests, and to a civil monetary penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018."
