  "summary": "On February 21, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of SELC, a nonprofit public interest law firm that focuses on environmental issues affecting six southeastern states.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that the Department of the Interior (DOI) unlawfully delayed responding to a request for documents related to the crossing of the Blue Ridge Parkway or Appalachian National Scenic Trail by the Atlantic Coast Pipeline.  According to the complaint, the DOI Defendants failed to adequately allege that the requested documents were subject to the policies and practices reflected in the Memoranda, and failed to timely respond to the request.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against the DOI defendants for their roles in the alleged violations of the federal securities laws.  On January 9, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against each of the defendants, as well as an order appointing a receiver to oversee the agency's collection and processing of documents.   The court also issued an order requiring the DOI to provide an accounting of the delays and withholdings of documents in response to a FOIA request, and requiring the agency to provide a copy of the requested records to the SEC as part of a case-by-case review.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 552(a)(3)(A), (a)(6)(A) and (b)(5)(B) (Securities Act).  The complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order, an injunction, and a return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest.  Finally, the complaint seeks a court-ordered injunction against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(b)(2)(A)(i)(1), and a court order prohibiting the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply for a penny stock, in the event of an emergency. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David Hutton and Carol Hutton of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, with assistance from Daniel Jorjani of the Atlanta Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0"
