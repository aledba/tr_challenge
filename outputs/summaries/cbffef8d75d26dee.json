  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Mercy Clinic Springfield Communities and Dr. Elene Pilapil in a medical malpractice case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, Missouri, alleges that, from 2011 through 2013, Williams was falsely told that she had a rare genetic disorder that causes an excess of copper to slowly accumulate in the vital organs.  According to the complaint, however, the jury found that Williams had a history of seizures and had been prescribed a medication that caused her seizures.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Williams was told that her seizures were caused by a beta-agonist that causes a \"subacute necrosis\" that occurs when a person's brain is damaged.  Williams allegedly had seizures in 2012 and 2013, and was unable to continue physical therapy school because of the treatment she received.  On April 27, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Williams from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 538.220 of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $21 million.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Williams consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the charged provisions, ordering her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requiring her to submit a civil injunctive action against the defendant.  Additionally, Williams agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the judgment, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  To settle the case, Williams also agreed to pay $10 million in disgorgement, $1.2 million in pre-judgment interest and a $1,500 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
