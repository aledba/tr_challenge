  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former administrative law judge for failing to timely raise an application for Social Security disability benefits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Musa Saeed Muhammad was improperly appointed to the position of Chief Administrative Officer of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and that he failed to raise his claim before the ALJ.  According to the complaint, the O.J. had previously ruled that ALJs were not entitled to be appointed pursuant to the Appointments Clause of the federal securities laws, and that Muhammad was entitled to a hearing at any time.  In a parallel action, the SEC's Office of Inspector General (OIG) today announced that it has issued an order requiring the OIG to conduct an independent review of the appointment of an ALJ, including a hearing on the merits of Muhammad's claim.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Muhammad consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  On November 2, 2018, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Muhammad arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  A hearing scheduled for December 21, 2018 will be held to determine whether to issue an order appointing an OIG as an independent judge.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13,843, (July 10, 2018).  The Commission's complaint charges Muhammad with violating Section 5 of the Administrative Rules of the Court and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  OIG also has agreed to a settlement where it will be determined by the court at a later date.  Among other things, the Commission has agreed that it will not require a hearing before the SEC or the DOJ as part of its pre-judgment review process.  It has also agreed that the SEC and OIG will not impose a time-consuming administrative proceeding, which is why it is not required to do so.   The complaint also names as a relief defendant a former OIG judge appointed by the SEC pursuant to Section 15(a)(1) the Administrative Procedure Act of 1940, and a former SEC judge as relief defendants."
