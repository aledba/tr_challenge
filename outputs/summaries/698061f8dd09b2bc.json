  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of a DuPage County resident who died without paying taxes.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on January 9, 2011, Dr. Surinder K. Parmar, a resident of Illinois, died, leaving an estate valued at more than $5 million.  According to the complaint, the estate was not subject to taxation under the Estate Tax Act. Rather, the complaint alleges that plaintiff paid the taxes involuntarily because he lacked knowledge of the prospect of penalties, interest, and personal liability under the estate tax and that the state had jurisdiction over the estate. The complaint also alleges that the estate's tax liability, including interest and penalties, was not covered by the state's sovereign immunity provisions, and that, in a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General and Secretary of State consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants.  In its order, the court also granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations, and ordered the payment of civil penalties and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty.  On January 13, 2011 the Illinois Court of Claims issued an order granting the SEC an emergency asset freeze and ordering the filing of a civil injunctive action against the Defendants. The order also issued an officer and director bar against each of the Defendants for violating the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the Defendants agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining the Defendants from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the Illinois securities laws, and ordering them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $400,000. The SEC also agreed to pay a $50,000 civil penalty in the parallel action. The settlement is subject to court approval. The Court of Appeals also agreed that the Defendants violated the antigree provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(e) of The Securities Act, and the officer anddirector bar. The final judgment against each defendant is pending final approval by the court. The settlements are subject to Court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5,"
