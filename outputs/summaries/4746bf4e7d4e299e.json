  "summary": "On January 3, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia entered a final judgment against Dale W. Akers, Jr., a Carroll County, Virginia resident, denying his request for Chapter 12 bankruptcy protection.  The court's order, which was entered on Jan. 3, 2020, finds that Akers was not entitled to leave to amend his plan because the bankruptcy court found that he failed to timely approve the fourth amended plan.  According to the order, Akers filed a petition under Chapter 12 on May 3, 2017, alleging that the court improperly granted him leave to file a fifth amended plan because he was unable to provide an accurate estimate of his monthly income from the cattle business that he operates with Ryan or the number of cattle that they own.  Akers' complaint, filed in federal district court in Alexandria, Virginia, charges Akers with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 12b-5 thereunder, and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the court granted Akers a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the filing of a new or modified plan. The court also denied Akers the right to apply for a penny stock bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Bankruptcy Commission today announced that it has issued an order suspending Akers from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Haffey and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Jennifer A. Bentsen. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Virginia Office of Financial Regulation."
