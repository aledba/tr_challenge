  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of multiple serious and violent felony convictions.  The court entered the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  According to the court's order, on March 22, 2016, California Highway Patrol Officer Scott Kliebe observed Robert Michael Gangl stealing a car and then driving it into a neighbor\u2019s home as he tried to elude capture. The court found that Gangl had a prior felony conviction for which he had been sentenced to a minimum of 25 years to life, and that the court had discretion to impose a third strike sentence for each of those felonies.  As alleged in the order, Gangl was not a threat to the public safety and was not eligible for parole at the time he was convicted.  In a parallel action, the court issued an order suspending the three strikes provision of the federal securities laws, ordering Gangl to comply with the court order, and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.\u00c2\u00a0 The court also ordered Gangl not to violate the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay a civil penalty, and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  To settle the SEC's case, the defendant agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the three strike provision, imposes a five-year mandatory minimum sentence, and requires him to be sentenced consecutively to all of his prior felony convictions, with the option of serving a six-year penalty at a later date.  Gangl agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the three-strike provision, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  He also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, including securities fraud, securities registration, and the issuance of a civil injunctive relief.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 513, 513-1, 514-2, 516-3, 517-4, 511-11, 521-13, and 521.  Judgment against Gangl will be issued by the court upon motion of the court.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of"
