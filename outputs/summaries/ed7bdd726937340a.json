  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the SEC in May 2015.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, on February 28, 2015, Luis Marte, of Brooklyn, New York, confronted him with a closed fist, causing a laceration to his lower lip, and then violently hit the walls with his fists.  According to the complaint, Marte replied, \"I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.\"  The court found that, contrary to the SEC's findings, the defendants did not violate the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Marte for his role in the alleged conduct.  On March 22, 2016, the SEC filed an emergency action, seeking a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an injunction, ordering the destruction of the video, and ordering a hearing to determine whether to proceed with the litigation.  A hearing was conducted on January 22, 2018, at which the Court found that the defendants acted with the intent to deprive another party of the information in the anticipation or conduct of litigation, which is fatal to the proposition that a negligent party has no right to retain the fruits of their misconduct.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Dec. 22, 2015).  The Court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered a hearing on March 24, 2016 and ordered the destruction and destruction of any evidence that may be relevant to the litigation, and ordered an emergency court hearing on April 29, 2018.   The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit, and Joseph G. Sansone, Regional Director of the New York Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
