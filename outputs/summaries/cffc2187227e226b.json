  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against Husband for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that Husband filed a false complaint in 2007 alleging that he and his wife orchestrated a scheme to steal property from their home in order to obtain a court order freezing his assets and preventing him from traveling to England on business ventures.  According to the complaint, Husband also claimed that his wife and attorney, Kelly M. Hvizdak, schemed to steal valuable personal property from the home in a bid to convince the court to grant Husband's request for a temporary restraining order and order freezing the assets of the home.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against HVZ.  Husband has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay $2.5 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $350,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, H&r;s attorney, Douglas G. Linn, Esquire, Linn Law Group, has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the securities laws and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a $1,500,000 civil penalty.  On March 20, 2017, the court granted Husband a preliminary injunction and ordered him to comply with the court's order to halt the alleged mail fraud.  A hearing scheduled for June 9, 2017 is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. EST.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 565 WDA 2009 (Feb. 22, 2014).  The U. S. Attorney's office for the Eastern District of Michigan today announced parallel criminal charges.  An SEC complaint unsealed today charges Husband with violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunctive relief, and civil penalties.  Separately, the SEC filed an amended complaint in the same court on March 13, 2014, alleging that H.R.A.P. \u00a7'1962(1) and (2) violations of Section 17(a)(1) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint also charges H. R. A."
