  "summary": "On October 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Saylor Suazo, a New York City resident charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Suazo was charged with a series of felony counts, including felony assault, attempted criminal obstruction of breathing or blood circulation, and attempted criminal contempt in the second degree.  Suazo consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal criminal laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of six months or less.  The court's order also prohibits Suazo from participating in any jury trial.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Suazo.  As alleged in the complaint, the federal government has imposed a six-month mandatory minimum prison sentence on Suazo in violation of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Section 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(c) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder, and a five-year officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's opinion, Saylor agreed to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  He also agreed to be enjoined from associating with any third-party law violator with whom he has a history of criminal convictions, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Separately, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered Suazo to comply with the order.  On November 2, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a preliminary injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Last week, the Court issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct a parallel criminal investigation, including an examination of the backgrounds of people charged with committing the felony, and ordering a hearing on the matter. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and Eric R. Werner of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The case is being supervised by Chedly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Attorney General"
