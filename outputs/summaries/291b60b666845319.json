  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arkansas today entered a final judgment against Markell Jimmerson, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to ninety-two years in the Arkansas Department of Correction.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Forrest City, Ark., alleges that, on December 25, 2014, the Forrest City Police Department conducted an emergency stop-and-search operation on two men who were found unresponsive and unresponsive in a car. According to the complaint, the officers found a handgun lying on the passenger seat of the vehicle and a pill bottle in the vehicle. The complaint further alleges that Jimmieerson immediately fled the scene and confronted the officers, telling them that he had been purchasing Xanax off the street to self-medicate his anxiety from having previously been shot in the head. Jimmiejerson allegedly told the officers that he was trying to sell some Xanax, but the men demanded the pills for cheaper than what Jimmiemie was asking. The court granted the officers' request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from making any further statements to the public, and ordered Jimmiejen to comply with the court's order. The jury deliberated for over an hour before finding JimmieJenner guilty of one count of first-degree murder and one count for manslaughter in the death of Gary Thomas. The final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Jimmie Jenner. The SEC is continuing its investigation into the matter. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Arkansas State Attorney General's Office, and the U. S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission in this matter."
