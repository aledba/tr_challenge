  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment against a Cherry Hill, N.J., police officer who was not designated as an expert witness in a motor vehicle accident.  According to the SEC's complaint, on February 8, 2012, Brian J. Rice was at a pub in Cherry Hill when he decided to purchase a Powerball ticket from a gas station on the eastbound side of State Highway 70.  The complaint alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, the officer's opinion about defendant's speed was so esoteric and too far beyond the \"ken\" of a layperson to be admissible, that he did not consider it reasonable to use the crosswalk at the time of the accident. The complaint further alleges that the trial judge improperly allowed the officer to divulge to the jury hearsay statements from other witnesses, including his sister-in-law and daughter, who had been passengers in the car when he attempted to cross the highway.  In addition, the court improperly allowed a police officer to provide opinion testimony about the safety of a pedestrian crossing under the guise of lay opinion when, in fact, he was not qualified to provide such testimony under the relevant federal statutes.  Finally, the complaint alleges the court misapplied its discretion in allowing Dolan to provide his opinion about the potential legality of his attempted crossing under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Rice consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,038,767, a civil penalty of $100,000, and a conduct-based injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Rule 206(3) and (4) thereunder of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of The Securities Act, and Section 9(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 5a-7 and 5d-8 thereunder, and requires him to provide written testimony in the form of an opinion concerning the safety and adequacy of a crosswalk.  Additionally, the judgment requires the court to determine whether a defendant is entitled to a new trial based on his or her credibility and factual assessments.    The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas and Eric R. Werner of the New Jersey Office of Public Health, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner."
