  "summary": "On May 1, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Colorado entered a final judgment against Central Bank, Inc., a Missouri-based bank holding company, and its former owner, Mortgage Central, LLC.  The court found that Central Bank and Mortgage Central violated the registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in El Paso County, Colorado, Central Bank was founded in 1902 as Central Missouri Trust Company, and in the late 1940s, it was the only bank in the state to have a \"Central Bank\" name.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the name of the bank was not specific to the specific state of Colorado, and neither Central Bank nor Mortgage Central were registered as a bank.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in 2010, the bank opened a branch in Colorado Springs under the name Central Bank & Trust Bank, which was not registered with the federal government.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, Central Bancorp agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a $100,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kelly L. Gibson, John Rymas, and Eric R. Werner of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Office of Inspector General, and the Colorado Department of Banking and Securities."
