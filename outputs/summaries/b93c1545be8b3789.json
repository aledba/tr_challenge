  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Social Security Administration (SSA) for denying the agency's request for a temporary restraining order and other emergency relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that on March 24, 2014, the SSA issued an order denying a request by the agency for an emergency restraining order temporarily restraining the agency from issuing any further orders or orders.  According to the complaint, the SEC's order, which was unsealed today, improperly relied on the recommendation of a former SSA employee who had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and had been sexually abused in her early twenties.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Dr. Gobeil, who was a registered representative of SSA, failed to adequately assess the severity of Plaintiff's symptoms.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, SSA has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering SSA to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  SSA's investigation was conducted by Jennifer Moodie and Michael Lebeaux and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Petter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Massachusetts Department of Health and Human Services in this matter.
