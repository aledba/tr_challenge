  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma on March 15, 2017, entered a final judgment against EagleMed, LLC and Air Evac EMS, Inc., two air ambulance companies, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, the defendants violated the preemption provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to disclose that the contracts were not enforceable.  The court also found that the defendants failed to adequately inform the court that they were entitled to preemption based on the fact that they had sought to collect money owed by the injured under their contracts in state court actions.  In addition, the court found that defendants had failed to comply with written agreements between the parties that required them to determine a reasonable price for air ambulance services.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  On March 16, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert A. Hannan of the United States District Court in Oklahoma granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, entered an order appointing a receiver, and appointed a receiver for the receivership of the receiver.  Hannan also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $15,180.53, leaving him with a bill for $19,516.26.  After the court subsequently rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 motions to dismiss, Hannan and Hannan agreed to settle the case by consenting to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions, ordering Hannan to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties of $45,101.94, and appoint a receiver to oversee the receiver\u2019s collection efforts. The court granted Hannan a temporary restraining order against further violations of these provisions, and a temporary injunction against further violation of the charged provision.  Hanan also has agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the public company or by association with any broker, dealer, municipal, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 20, 2016).  The SEC's investigation was conducted by David A. Kasper and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led"
