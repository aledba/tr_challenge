  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against a Minnesota man who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Minnesota, alleges that, from at least 2007 through 2011, K.L.W. was the father of a child born in January 2012. According to the complaint, the child was in the parent\u2019s care when appellant sexually abused her while she was in his care. The complaint further alleges that the complaint raised concerns about his ability to protect and care for the child, and the district court terminated his parental rights.  In its judgment, the court found that appellant violated Section 260C.301, subd. 1 of the egregious-harm statute, and that he was not fit and suitable to parent the child. The court also found that, for the purposes of its best-interests analysis, appellant had not engaged in the parenting of the child after his cohabitation with M.B. had ended, and he had not taken the appropriate steps to educate himself about his special needs.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's judgment, defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Minnesota Department of Social Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Minnesota Office of Inspector General, the Department of Health and Human Services Criminal Justice Division, the Division of Child and Family Education, the State Attorney General's Office, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Justice Department, the District of Columbia Department of Banking and Securities and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Investigation."
