  "summary": "On January 6, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Washington entered a final judgment against King County, Washington, that permanently enjoins the county from filing a lawsuit against a public works contractor in the county where the contractor resides.  The SEC's complaint, filed in King County Superior Court, alleges that King County violated the federal securities laws by failing to provide a venue for a civil works contract that required the contractor to use \"Open Face Shield Tunneling\" (OFST) and a specific dewatering system for the project. The complaint also alleges that the court improperly denied King County the right to file a suit against the contractor under the priority of action rule.  According to the complaint, King County also failed to provide an adequate venue for the civil works contractor to file its complaint in the court where the complaint was filed.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company.  On January 8, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to determine the venue of a court proceeding.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the defendants agreed to the final judgment that it was in default and unenforceable under the 2015 federal securities law. The court also denied the request to transfer venue to Snohomish County, which is where the SEC filed its complaint. The SEC previously issued an order requiring the county to file an emergency action in the case of an unincorporated county, which it did not do so.  This case is being handled by the SEC Enforcement Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice. The litigation will be handled by Scott Frost, Chief of the Division of Enforcement, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Umpqua County Office of Public Works and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in this matter."
