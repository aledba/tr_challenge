  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant seeking to have his conviction for second-degree murder and other charges dismissed against him by the court.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 20, 2018, in Moreno Valley, California, Marquez, a member of the rival criminal street gang Kush Blown Kings, planned and directed the murder of a rival gang member.  The complaint alleges that Cervantes, then 17, picked up his fellow gang members, codefendants Mageo and Mariscal, at a local park and ordered them to drive around looking for Marquez and find him walking back from Circle K with two friends, carrying soda and snacks.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the defendant did not have a gun and instead used a wooden bat to murder Marquez.  In a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed a parallel criminal case against the defendant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the pre-judgment provision of Section 1170.95 of the Exchange Act that imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years to life, and a $60 court operations fee.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $2,064.58, a $100,000 civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other emergency relief.  On August 2, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a preliminary injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and preliminary and permanent injunctions against further violations of the charged statutes.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the California Office of the Attorney General in this matter."
