  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to a life sentence without the possibility of parole.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on January 22, 2016, while working at a package store in Gordon County, Georgia, a man wearing a \"hunting mask\" and \"poncho\" with a mask covered his entire face and covered his eyes.  According to the complaint, the man then allegedly entered the package store's back alley and demanded money from the cash register, telling the cashier that he would give him the money.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, however, the transaction evidence was not sufficient for the defendant to show that he had a willingness to use a firearm to get money to enrich himself.  Instead, the complaint alleges, the Appellant allegedly used the money to purchase a gun and then used the stolen cash to make a Ponzi-like payment to a co-defendant who had been previously convicted of a felony.  In addition, the SEC alleges that the defendant was unable to identify the robber because of the mask and the mask, and that he did not know if he had been a felon at the time of the alleged armed robbery.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $4,000, prejudgment interest of $2,500, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On March 2, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Mascianica of the United States District Court in Atlanta granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendant, as well as a conduct-based injunction against further violations of Section 24-4-404 of the federal securities laws.  A hearing for the motion was scheduled for May 24, 2018.   The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Georgia State Attorney General's Office, and the U. S. Secret Service."
