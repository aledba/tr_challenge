  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Edwin Matute, Jr., who was convicted of three counts of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, J.M., and sentenced to 27 years' imprisonment.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, alleges that, on July 23, 2014, Matute entered a guilty plea in a criminal case against his cousin, who was also charged with the same conduct.  According to the complaint, after learning that defendant had been having sexual intercourse with a child for three separate occasions, he asked his cousin to accompany him to the police station and to let him know if he did not understand the warning.  Matute agreed to the plea without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint and agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay a civil penalty of 27 years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Matute.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Margaret S. McCole granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of the evidence.  A hearing on August 4, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-20 (2014).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations, and Joseph G. Sansone, Regional Director of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Arizona Department of Criminal Justice, the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Arizona State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
