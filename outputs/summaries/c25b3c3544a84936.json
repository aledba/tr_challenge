  "summary": "On April 7, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of two felony counts of assault in the second degree and endangering the welfare of a child.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, from January 2015 through January 2016, defendant's son (hereinafter the victim), who was almost three months old at the time, sustained a fracture of his right femur after defendant, who was then 19 years old, forcefully picked him up by the leg as the victim was lying in a swing.  The complaint alleges that defendant was irrationally allowed to question other women at trial about his overtures to them, and, when confronted by the victim's mother, defendant replied, \"If he did it, he didn't mean to.\u201d  The SEC alleges that the defendant was not capable of causing the sustained injuries on his own and that he had picked up the child \"aggressively because he was upset that the [victim] was crying.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against defendant.  In its continuing investigation, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against defendant from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as a civil injunctive action from the District Attorney.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the New York Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry."
