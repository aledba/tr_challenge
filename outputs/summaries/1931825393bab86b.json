  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendant in a parental termination case against her.  The court found that Mother had failed to comply with a court order to terminate her parental rights.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, the court improperly considered evidence regarding the previous termination of parental rights to determine whether Mother was in the best interest of the children.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Utah today announced criminal charges against Mother for her role in the alleged misconduct.  As alleged in the complaint, in November 2018, Mother was sentenced to 12 months in prison for drug and alcohol-related violations. The court also found that, while in prison, Mother had been exposed to methamphetamine while in utero, and that she had suffered severe mental and physical abuse. The complaint further alleges that, after she was incarcerated, Mother began to use methamphetamine, failed to seek and complete drug treatment, and committed multiple violations of her criminal probation.  On May 22, 2019, the juvenile court issued an order terminating Mother's parental rights without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint. The order also ordered Mother to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Mother has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Advocacy and Advocacy with the assistance of the Utah Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS). The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. McCole and supervised by Scott L. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Utah Department of Health and Human Services (DOHSA)\u00c2\u00a0Investigations in the matter of Mother's alleged misconduct are continuing."
