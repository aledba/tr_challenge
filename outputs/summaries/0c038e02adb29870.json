  "summary": "On June 6, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California entered a final judgment against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Equifax Information Services LLC, which are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1785 of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, charges Wells Fargo with violations of the reporting provisions of Sections 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(5) of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Wells Fargo has agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  Wells Fargo also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $8,435, which is equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against the defendants.  On June 8, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Capital One, alleging that it failed to adequately investigate the allegations in its complaint and failed to respond to the SEC's requests for a temporary restraining order, a cease-and-desist order, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of certain of the receivers' accounts.   The complaint also alleges that Capital One failed to timely respond to an SEC subpoena request for a copy of its credit report, which was sent to the agency by the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter."
