  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment against Quinten McMurry, a convicted felon, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, alleges that, in June 2016, McMurry was charged by a district court in Petrie, Iowa with a felony charge of making a false report of an incendiary explosive device. The complaint alleges that the district court imposed an illegal sentence by ordering him to pay court-appointed attorney fees before the amount of the fees was known. In addition, the complaint alleges the court ordered McMurry to enter into an Alford plea of guilty to the charges that resulted in a conviction and the court dismissed the other charges. The SEC alleges that McMurry failed to comply with the court's order to apportion the total court costs between the counts of conviction and those dismissed by the court, and that the court erred in ordering the defendant to pay only one-third of the court costs.

The sentencing court in this case never addressed or decided which court costs McMurry had to pay. Instead, it ordered him to settle the matter by agreeing to a judgment that would impose a permanent injunction, impose a $20,000 civil penalty, and pay restitution in the amount that was determined by the clerk of court. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws. The judgment also imposed a $40,000 penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar. The judge agreed to the settlement without admitting, denying, or condensing the allegations of the complaint.
