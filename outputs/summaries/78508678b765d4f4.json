  "summary": "On July 1, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against defendants Coinstar, Inc., Redbox Automated Retail, LLC, and Crystal Lake, Illinois, that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and injunctive relief.  The court also granted the defendants' motion to transfer venue.  According to the court's order, Coinstar and Redbox agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Coinstar for its role in an automobile accident in which Debbie Schuster was injured.  Coinstar has agreed to pay $1.2 million in disgorgment, $1,500 in prejudgment interests, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Crystal Lake agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mark Fennell.
