  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was sentenced to 64 months in prison for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, Powers was first sentenced in 1990 and received an enhancement under the Armed Forces Criminal Act for prior convictions including a state-level charge that followed his escape from jail. The SEC alleges that Powers was a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, possession of an unregistered firearm, transportation of a stolen vehicle, and possession of counterfeit currency. The complaint alleges that the district court improperly speculated about facts surrounding the defendant\u2019s failure to receive a benefit for his substantial assistance in a murder case. The court ultimately imposed a sentence that was procedurally and substantively unreasonable.  The SEC further alleges that, in a parallel action, Powers filed a motion to vacate his sentence, which was later denied by the court.  In its judgment, the court found that Powers violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5G1.3 thereunder, and that Powers, as a result of his incarceration, was liable for a civil penalty of 64 months.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the SEC has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Powers from future violations of Section 5, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his sentence. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Order No. 5, No. 1371 (11th Cir. 2013).  The U.N. Office of Justice and the Office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Powers.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court of Appeals issued an order suspending Powers from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The order also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of the SEC, as well as from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Separately, on May 9, 2018, the Court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order against Powers, ordering him to surrender his passport, pay a $75,000 civil penalty, and be barred from serving any prison term.  A hearing scheduled for June 13, 2019 is scheduled for July 24, 2019.  To learn more about pre-judgment review, see"
