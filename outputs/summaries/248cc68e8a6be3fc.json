  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Richard Mise, a convicted child molesting defendant, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Mise violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act by failing to disclose that he had touched two of the victims' vaginas while they were in the house. Mise also was convicted of a felony child molestation and a Class C felony. The SEC also charged Mise with violating Rule 404(b). Mise has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $50,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The final judgment also prohibits Mise from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the SEC's investigation. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Mise.  Mise pleaded guilty to the charges and agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, to a five-year officer-and-director bar, and to a three-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from associating with anyone other than his own children. The court also ordered Mise to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a $25,000 civil penalty. The settlements are subject to Court approval. The case is being handled by Scott J. Mathews, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Mises. The Court appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
