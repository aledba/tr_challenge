  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against three defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that Nathaniel Hoskins, Julian Martin, and Torrie King were members of the Imperial Insane Vice Lords, a Chicago-based gang that controlled drug operations near Thomas Street and Keystone Avenue. According to the complaint, the Vice Lords had a sustained hierarchy that persisted over a ten-year period and its members worked toward common objectives. The complaint alleges that the defendants held meetings, controlled certain areas, and used punishments to maintain control over lower-level members. In one recording, Hoskins allegedly told Martin that he was with Martin, Brown, and others following the murder of Hurley and that Brown informed them that he had killed Hurley. Martin also allegedly helped Brown change his appearance after the murder. The court also found that Martin had discussed or hinted at the attempted murder of Smith and Carr with another Vice Lords member in the days after the alleged murder, and that he paid for his room at the Red Roof Inn the night before the murder to help Brown alter his appearance. The defendants' final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay a civil penalty of 360 months to life, and requires them to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged scheme. Martin has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maryland State Attorney General's Office, and the Maryland Department of Criminal Justice."
