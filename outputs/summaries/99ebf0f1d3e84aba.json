  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Gonzalo Vasquez-Gonzalez, a Mexican citizen who was removed from the United States for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Vasquez.  According to the court's order, Vasquez, who was originally from Mexico, was arrested for a felony grand theft from a person and sentenced to 180 days of imprisonment and 36 months of probation. The court found that Vasquez was eligible for a discretionary waiver of removal under Section 212(a)(1) and failed to inform him of his eligibility for a potential waiver. Vasquez also was convicted of a felony battery arising out of a separate incident with a different victim.  Vasquez has agreed to settle the case by agreeing to the entry of a permanent injunction, which prohibits him from violating the federal criminal laws, and to pay a civil penalty of $250,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (OIE) today announced that it has issued an order to expedite the filing of a court order requiring a hearing on the merits of the case. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, charges Vasquez with violating Section 206 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1940, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The litigation will be led by Mr. Viana and Ms. Gaunt, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Kasper and Eric R. Werner of the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. The investigation was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry and Antonia Chion.
