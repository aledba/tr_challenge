  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against HomeAway, Inc. (\"HomeAway\"), a Texas-based online home-rental rental company, and its owner, Deirdre Seim, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 17a-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants and ordered them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Lefoldt, Texas, the defendants agreed to arbitrate threshold questions related to the arbitration provision in the April 2016 Terms and Conditions, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In addition, the court found that, under Texas law, a party resisting arbitration has the unilateral right to avoid arbitration at any point without notice.   The complaint also alleges that, in Rent-A-Center, W., Inc. v. WestEnd Capital Management, L.L.P., 853 F.3d at 674, that the parties had agreed to arbitration based on a clause in the arbitration agreement that expressly specified that a certain number of claims would be resolved by way of arbitration, regardless of whether prior versions of the arbitration provisions required arbitration.  As a result of the court's order, the parties have agreed to compel arbitration in reliance on this provision without providing notice. The SEC's order also requires the parties to show cause and consent to the entry of judgments that impose permanent injunctions, imposing civil penalties, and imposing penny stock bars against each party. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Texas Department of Insurance."
