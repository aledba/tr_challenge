  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of second-degree murder in connection with the January 10, 2016, stabbing death of a Shreveport, Louisiana woman.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that defendant Michael Allen, a forensic pathologist with the Louisiana State Police Crime Lab, provided false testimony to the court regarding the nature, location, and severity of the victim's injuries.  According to the complaint, Allen provided testimony that corroborated the testimony of his sister, Shameka Grider, who testified that she had seen the victim burn a brush pile outside of her house.  In addition, Allen allegedly told his sister that he had just been released from jail against all odds and compares himself to a great white shark on the streets that needs to eat.  He also allegedly claimed that he knew the victim from when she was employed as a correctional officer.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that Allen was ineffective in failing to object to the state's introduction of the evidence of the alleged victim's death, which was corroborated by Grider's testimony.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Allen consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000 and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Allen from further violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  On May 24, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against Allen, ordering him to surrender his passport, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against him.  Judge McCole also granted the motion for an officer-and-director bar against Allen and ordered him to comply with the court order prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer and sell of, or offer of, any securities in the securities of any broker, dealer, municipal, or municipal securities dealer.   The court also ordered Allen to pay a $50,000 penalty.  To settle the case, Allen agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunction, and the appointment of a trial attorney."
