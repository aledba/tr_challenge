  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Travis Darnell James, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to nine years in prison for a second-degree murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Louisiana, alleges that, on July 30, 2017, Travis James was confronted by a man who claimed to be a drug dealer who had been stabbed multiple times. According to the complaint, James told the man that he had been thrown from a car with multiple stab wounds and that he was going to the hospital. The complaint further alleges that the man told James that he did not know how he got the stab wounds but that he \"was going so fast\" that he hit the victim in the chest. The SEC alleges that James replied, \"you know, they got me. Somebody stabbed me.\"  The court also found that the defendant had a history of drug use and had been previously incarcerated for simple burglary. The court's order against James, which was entered in a parallel action, permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, James consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoined him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordered him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordered him not to participate in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future. The final judgment also prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any officer-and-director disciplinary proceeding.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted an asset freeze against Travis James, who was later convicted and sentenced to prison.  On August 2, 2018, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act and Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 14d-3 thereunder. The Court granted the request for a temporary restraining order, ordered a conduct-based injunction, and issued an order requiring the defendant to surrender his passport, pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and be restrained from associating with any person with whom he has a prior felony conviction. The order also prohibits the defendant from using the internet to disseminate or sell any information concerning his prior criminal convictions."
