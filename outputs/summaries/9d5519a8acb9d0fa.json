  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today issued a final judgment ordering a trial court to inquire about a defendant's age, experience, and understanding of the rules of criminal procedure.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Sylvester Hooks, who was charged with two drug-related charges, sought to waive his right to counsel. According to the complaint, the trial judge gave Hooks a document entitled \"Self-Representation Advisory Form/Trial\" and later asked whether Hooks had read the form \"real carefully.\" The complaint further alleges that the trial court failed to ask about the defendant's \"technical legal knowledge\" and that the defendant did not \"knowingly and intelligently\" waive the right of counsel. The complaint also alleges that, as a result of this conduct, Hooks was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment and McGirth, 209 So. 3d at 1157, was ordered to represent himself during jury selection. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hooks.  In its complaint, filed in federal district court in Orlando, Florida, the SEC alleges that Hooks violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (Sept. 24, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case has been supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Florida Office of Inspector General, and the Florida Department of State Office of Criminal Investigations."
