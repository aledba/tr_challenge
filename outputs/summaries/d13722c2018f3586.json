  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment in favor of Belmont Holding, LLC, a Mississippi-based real estate development company, and its co-defendant, Jason Davis, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on March 8, 2016, Belmont filed a complaint in replevin in the County Court of Jackson County, Mississippi, alleging that, after filing a notice of appeal, it was unable to post a cost bond within thirty days of the final judgment as required by Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, on June 13, 2017, the court granted Belmont's motion to dismiss, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, a judgment that permanently enjoins Belmont from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 11-51-79 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder, and orders Belmont to pay a $374,000 civil penalty and a $38,000 officer-and-director bar.

On May 26, 2010, the judge issued its estimated cost for preparing the trial transcript, which was $38; on June 21, 2016 the court clerk entered a Rule 11 certificate of compliance, evidencing the satisfaction of the statutory bond requirement. On June 24, 2016 it filed a brief in support of its appeal against the judgment, which, in its opinion, was denied by the court because it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal. On July 23, 2018, a federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi issued an order requiring the receiver in default to pay the $374 civil penalty. On August 18, 2017 the court denied the receiver's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the receiver"
