  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of South Carolina today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing administrative proceeding against South Carolina-based real estate developer John M. McIntyre and his company Silver Oak Land Management, LLC.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbia, South Carolina, alleges that, on April 19, 2013, the SEC issued a Cease and Desist Order, concluding that Appellants had committed seventy-eight violations of the federal securities laws. The Commission also issued a Report and Recommendation, concluding the Commission's findings were \"conclusive,\" and imposing a maximum civil penalty of $540,000.  According to the complaint, however, the Commission had no reasonable expectation that the Commission would issue a final judgment that would impose a permanent injunction and impose a $50,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against McIntyre.   The Commission's order, which was unsealed today, permanently enjoins the Commission from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the Commission to conduct an administrative proceeding pursuant to Section 35-1-605(a)(1). The Commission has agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the U. S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission in this matter."
