  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendants Roy and Catherine St. Pierre for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that defendants failed to pay them reasonable attorney's fees for their work improving a stand of maple trees on defendants' land for maple sugaring.  According to the complaint, defendants advertised a Jeep for sale and discussed purchasing the vehicle. The complaint further alleges that the defendants never agreed to pay a share of profits to the substantially prevailing party under the PPA. Instead, defendants allegedly spent too much time cutting the brush surrounding the trees and spent too little time preparing the sugar bush. The court ultimately concluded that the parties did not have the money to pay for the labor necessary to operate the business.  In its judgment, the court found that defendants had substantially prevailed on their claims, and that defendants were not entitled to withhold payment because they failed to establish a good faith counterclaim under 9VS.A. \u00a7'4007(b).  The court also ruled that defendants did not violate the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.  This case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Vermont Department of Insurance, and the Vermont Office of Inspector General in this matter."
