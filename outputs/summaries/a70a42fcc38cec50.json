  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered final judgments in favor of Tenant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Tenant violated Section 78B-6-802 of the Exchange Act by subletting a portion of a warehouse building without his knowledge or consent.  According to the complaint, Tenant agreed to settle the case by agreeing to pay $53,100 in attorney fees and $30,000 in cross-appeal costs.  Tenant also agreed to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his attorney fees.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for Utah today announced criminal charges against Tenant arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.    The complaint alleges that, in violation of the federal securities laws, Landlord violated Section 7(b)(2)(A) and Rule 7b2-3 thereunder, and that he is entitled to attorney fees for successfully defending against Landlord\u2019s alleged violations of Section 8(a) and (c).  The court also found that, because Tenant was in possession of the warehouse at the time the complaint was filed, he did not have the right to the warehouse and therefore did not qualify for attorney fees as the prevailing party.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the court has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Tenant from violating the charged provisions and orders him to pay civil penalties of $153,600 plus reasonable attorney fees, and orders Tenant to comply with a court order requiring him to vacate the warehouse in accordance with the terms of the settlement.  On May 2, 2018, a federal district court in Utah granted a temporary restraining order and issued an order suspending the asset freeze pending final judgment on the merits of the case. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter in the Salt Lake Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Utah Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
