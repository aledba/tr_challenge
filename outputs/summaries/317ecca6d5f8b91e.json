  "summary": "On April 5, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a Van Nuys, California-based company and its co-defendant in a $1.8 million health care fraud case.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, International Trade & Consulting, LLC (ITC) and Abdul King Garba, owned and operated ITC, a durable medical equipment supplier, and submitted claims to Medicare for medically unnecessary power wheelchairs. The complaint alleges that, between 2006 and 2009, ITC and Anieze-Smith fraudulently billed Medicare for a total of $1,890,433.82, including $\u2002897,726.91 that Medicare paid to the company, even though only $60,411 of that amount was actually billed to Medicare.  In addition, the complaint alleged that ITC failed to adequately account for the losses caused by the defendants\u2019 conduct throughout the course of the fraudulent scheme.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders them to pay restitution in the amount of $814,445.95. The judgment also orders Anie-Smith to pay a civil penalty of $19,500. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the United States Postal Inspection Service. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov."
