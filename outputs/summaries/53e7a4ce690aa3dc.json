  "summary": "On January 10, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Randy E. Hoffman and Sherry L. Hoffman, husband-and-wife, in a timber-reservation case.  According to the court's order, Hoffman and Hoffman agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 521 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order requiring them to remove the timber from the property.  In its order, the court found that the defendants had no interest in the timber, and that their rights to the timber were extinguished when they failed to remove it within a reasonable amount of time.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, the defendants agreed to a permanent injunction, to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits, and to pay civil penalties equal to their respective profits.  On January 19, 2017 the court granted the parties' motion for a preliminary injunction, entered an emergency consent judgment, and issued an order suspending the defendants from future timber harvesting.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
