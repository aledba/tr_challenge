  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment against Oklahoma State Department of Human Services caseworkers who allegedly failed to protect vulnerable children in the Matthews' home.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, alleges that, between January 2004 and March 2014, various individuals, all with good cause, reported to the agency that the Matthews were being abused by their father.  According to the complaint, the caseworker allegedly told the children that he or she would \"screen out\" a referral that alleged the home was dangerous and filthy, that the children were bathed once a week to save money on water, and that the child was being \"misplaced\" in the home by his or her fellow co-workers.  In addition, the complaint alleges that when an individual called to report the abuse to the state, the individual \"screened out\" the referral and instructed the child not to bathe.  As alleged, the child's injuries were so severe that he rendered the child \"profoundly\" handicapped and in need of institutionalization.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On October 4, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered an order permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 each, and ordering them to disgorge their allegedly negligent conduct and pay civil injunctive relief in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  This case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, John R. Rymas, and Amy C. McKinley of the Philadelphia Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oklahoma Department of Health and Human Services, and the Oklahoma Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
