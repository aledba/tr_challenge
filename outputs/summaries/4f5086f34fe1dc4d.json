  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment against Madison C., a registered nurse who was convicted of domestic violence and sentenced to prison for her role in the case.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Madison and her then-boyfriend, Jaden R., to prevent her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 43-247(3)(a) of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, Madison, who was born in 1997, began to engage in services and focus on her children, Leyton C. and Landyn C. when she was 18 years old and living with her parents when she began a relationship with Jaden. As alleged in the complaint, Madison had a history of substance abuse and drug use, and Jaden was a bad influence in her life. As a result of this, Madison was unable or unwilling to participate in the services provided by the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) for both children. Madison also was unable to access the services offered to her by her supervisor, Emily Goodman, due to her severe PTSD. The court found that Madison was in the best interests of the children when she terminated her parental rights to Leyton, Landyn, and Leyton. Madison was also in the early stages of recovering from her domestic violence, when she sought and obtained a protection order against Jaden, and when Goodman was leaving on maternity leave.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Madison. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Lincoln, Nebraska, charges Madison with violating the anti-trafficking provisions of Sections 43-242(2), (4), and (6) of\u00c2\u00a0The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Justice. The litigation will be led by Amy S. Cotter and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Nebraska Office of Child and Family Education."
