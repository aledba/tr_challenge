  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Rachel Chastain, a Washington, D.C.-based mother of two, for terminating her parental rights to her daughter MC (born January 5, 2010).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Arkansas, alleges that Rachel was prevented from having meaningful contact with MC because of her lack of a relationship with her father.  According to the complaint, Rachel's father, Cole Cragg, was incarcerated in Arizona and had recently moved to Arizona to live with his wife Lesley Cragg and MC's half sister AC.  The complaint alleges that the court found that Rachel had no relationship with MC and that she did not participate in family counseling when she was placed in the custody of MC.  In its judgment, the court held that Rachel violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Rachel consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining her from violating Section 9-27-341(b)(3)(A)(i) and (B)(iii) and ordering her to return to Arkansas for family counseling and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Rachel also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years and to be permanently enjoined from participating in the agency's child welfare program.  On May 22, 2018, a federal district court in Arizona entered a temporary restraining order against Rachel from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered her to comply with the court's order.  As set forth in the order, Rachel did not exercise her visitation rights after Cole was awarded custody of the child in August 2014 and did not take any legal action to enforce her visitation right after MC had been in DHS custody for almost six months so that Rachel could get used to his not being around because she was not a fit parent for purposes of custody.   The court also ordered Rachel to come to Arkansas to visit MC and to provide financial support to the child's mother and to contact her local state representative and senator to request that the home study be expedited by child services in Arizona.
