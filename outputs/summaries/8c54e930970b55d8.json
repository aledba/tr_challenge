  "summary": "On January 22, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, on July 15, 2017, a federal district court in Humble, Texas entered an order suspending the defendant from participating in the child safety plan. The court found that the defendant had violated Section 161.001 of the federal securities laws and that he was liable to be terminated based on his failure to comply with the court's order.  In its order, the court also ordered the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 15(b)(1)(D) and Section 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty. The judge also granted the defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 16(a)(2)(A) and (B) and Rule 16a-3 thereunder, and ordered the court to determine whether to impose a permanent injunction against further violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rules 206(3) and 206 (4)-8 thereunder; and orders the destruction of any evidence that may be relevant to the termination determination.  On January 24, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Father, charging him with violating Sections 206 (1), (2), (3), and (4), and ordering him to return to the United States and pay a civil monetary penalty of $5,000. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Bort. The case is being supervised by C.M.R.H. Welshhans and Ms. Gaunt.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Office of Children and Family Education and Advocacy."
