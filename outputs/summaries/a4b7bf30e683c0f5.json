  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona today entered a final judgment in favor of the Arizona Department of Water Resources (ADWR) against Pueblo Del Sol Water Company (Pueblo).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Arizona, alleges that, in 2008, the Arizona Legislature issued an order requiring ADWR to consider unquantified federal reserved water rights when determining whether a developer has an adequate water supply for purposes of a federal reserve water right.  According to the complaint, ADWR then issued a draft decision and order finding that it was unable to determine the minimum amount of water needed to fulfill the agency\u2019s requirements.  The complaint further alleges that ADWR failed to consider the issue of whether the reserve water rights should be included in the ADWR specifications.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's order, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Arizona today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged scheme.   The court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an injunction against future violations of the federal reserve rights, as well as a civil injunctive action. \u00c2\u00a0The court also granted the parties\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Arizona Water Commission v. Arizona Water Resources, Inc., No. 17-cv-5221 (2008).    In its complaint, the SEC alleges that the Arizona Attorney General and Secretary of the Department of the Interior violated the federal securities laws by failing to adequately assess the adequacy of the state reserve water supply.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that DWR violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Arizona law.  DWR has agreed to settle the case against it by consenting to a permanent injunction, with the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court at a later date.  Additionally, DWR agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which would be offset by a $50,000 civil penalty, and to pay an officer-and-director bar.  Finally, the court agreed to a partial injunction and to the imposition of a $75,000 penalty.  This settlement is pending approval by the Arizona Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Arizona Division of Commerce. "
