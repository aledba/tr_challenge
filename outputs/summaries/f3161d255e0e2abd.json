  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a Miami-Dade Police Department officer who was arrested for carrying a gun during a routine traffic stop.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the officer, who was also charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, on the evening of November 30, 2016, the officer stopped a black Audi sedan that was parked in the middle of the road and ordered the driver and passenger to exit the car. The court further ruled that the officers had reasonable suspicion to detain the driver of the Audi and that he had a gun in his back pocket.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the officers did not have reasonable suspicion of any possible threat to the driver or the passengers of the car, and instead simply delayed the officers\u2019 approach to the Audi.  In addition, the court found that the officer had no reasonable basis to detain both Jones and Gibbs during the stop, and therefore did not need to issue a ticket for the driver.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The order also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a law enforcement agency, including the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order.  Separately, the Court issued an order denying Lopez and Dweck\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence in the case, ordering them to comply with the court order, and ordering the officers to provide a copy of the complaint to the SEC as well as to provide an explanation for why the officers acted this way.  On November 31, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleging that the Miami Police Department conducted a traffic stop in violation of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Securities Act of 1933. The SEC also charged the officer who conducted the stop with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act. The complaint also alleged that, as a result of the conduct of the officers, Gibbs was unlawfully restrained from leaving the car and was subsequently arrested by the Florida State Police. The case was investigated by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley of the Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by"
