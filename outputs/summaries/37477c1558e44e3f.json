According to the complaint, DCP and the DOJ violated the preemption provisions of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act by failing to impose price-discrimination and volume discounts on wholesalers. The court also found that the post-and-hold provisions violated Section 15b-3 of the Exchange Act, and that DCP was liable for violations of Section 16(a)(2)(A)(3)(B) under Section 15a-3 thereunder of the Act. DCP has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions. The settlement is subject to court approval. The litigation against DCP will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Connecticut Office of Regulatory Affairs in this matter."
