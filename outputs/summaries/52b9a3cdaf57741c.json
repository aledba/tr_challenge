  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Bank of America N.A. against the company for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on September 20, 2016, the court found that, contrary to the court\u2019s finding that the defendants were subject to personal jurisdiction in Indiana, the defendants had not breached the federal securities laws.  The court also ruled that, based on the defendants\u2019 actions in negotiating and entering into the loan purchase agreement, they were not subject to the jurisdiction of the federal district court in which they were located.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Indiana today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  As alleged in the complaint, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order halting the defendants from violating the securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amounts of $9 million and $11 million, respectively.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, BofA agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1404, which is equal to the penalty imposed by the federal court.  On September 21, 2018, Judge Chin granted the SEC request for an emergency asset freeze and other emergency relief, including an asset freeze, and ordered that the court consider the merits of the SEC action.  A hearing is scheduled for October 24, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1784 (Aug. 24, 2016).
