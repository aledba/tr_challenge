  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida yesterday entered a final judgment ordering the disclosure of personal financial records and attorney-client privileged information to a third party.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that, following the death of her father John Barron, Michelle Barron-Lunde obtained approximately $200,000 from John Barron's estate. According to the complaint, after John Barron passed away in 2016, the couple held three joint bank accounts. The complaint alleges that John Barron required more care and required frequent visits to his medical and attorney appointments and to the bank. The SEC alleges that as a trustee of the subject account funds, Barron wrote checks to Petitioner, which she deposited into the trust. The court found that the records were not discoverable because they were brought out through Petitioner's deposition testimony, and the court found the material portions of the complaint to be relevant to the discovery of the records. The Court also found that, in the absence of a subpoena, the defendant could not have obtained the records without first reviewing them to determine whether a privilege applied.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order halting the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any documents related to John Barron. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Hett. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Florida Department of Insurance, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United States Attorney's Office for the State of Florida and the Florida Secretary of State's Office.
