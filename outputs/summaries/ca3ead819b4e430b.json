  "summary": "On February 26, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Christopher Howard, Jr., a member of the now-defunct Mill Brook Gang, for orchestrating a series of high-profile shootings in and around Mill Brook, New York.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Howard told one of his friends that he was going to a party with a rival gang member and wanted to \"beat him up\" in order to \"get status\" in the gang.  The complaint further alleges that Howard told the friend that he would \"peter roll one of those guys\" and \"hit him in the face\" if he did not want to be left out of the gang's business.  Howard also allegedly told his friend that, when confronted by the rival gang members, Howard replied, \"I ain't just being the average individual amongst the whole bunch.\"  The SEC alleges that, contrary to these statements, Howard did not engage in any aggressive or aggressive acts of violence.  Instead, Howard allegedly used his own gun to carry out the shootings.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Howard, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Howard consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $1,000 civil penalty.  On March 6, 2020, the Honorable Robert W. Washburn of the United Kingdom entered a judgment against Howard against him, ordering him to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged sections of the securities laws.  Washburn also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and ordered to pay $2,500 in restitution, which he will pay in the amount of $100,000.  He also agreed not to be associated with any other criminal organization, and to be prohibited from associating with anyone with a history of violence, including his own criminal history.  Additionally, Washburn agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar, which prohibits him from participating in any type of criminal activity, including securities fraud, securities law, or securities law violations.  Williams agreed to the same conduct-"
