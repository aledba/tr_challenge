  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Lawrence Johnson, a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that Johnson, who was previously sentenced to 180 months in prison for a felony robbery, attempted to commit aggravated robbery, and a 1997 conviction for complicity to commit a controlled substance offense.  According to the complaint, Johnson had several prior convictions from Ohio, including a 1982 conviction for attempted robbery, a 1983 conviction for robbery and a 2005 conviction for accomplishing a felony.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Johnson had had at least two felony convictions for robbery under the previous federal laws, and that one of those convictions constituted a crime of violence under the current federal laws.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, that neither conviction qualified as a \"crime of violence\" under the relevant federal laws and that Johnson did not have at least three prior convictions for crimes of violence that required the government to prove the elements of the underlying violent felony, such as a robbery, an attempted theft, or a felony criminal conviction.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Johnson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 180 months, the statutory minimum, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the United States.  Johnson also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and to be restrained from associating with any person with a bank or investment in a real estate development project.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 559, 248 (6th Cir. 2017).  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Order\u00c2\u00a0to encourage victims of domestic violence to check the background of anyone selling or offering them a security deposit using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0Violence Detection and Detection,\u00c2\u00a0On\u00c2\u00a0January\u00c2\u00a017, 2018."
