  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Nevada today entered a final judgment against a Las Vegas man who was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to prison for second- and third-degree felony murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Las Vegas, Nevada, alleges that Vernon Newson, a California resident, opened fire on Anshanette McNeil and her two-year-old son while they were driving in a rented SUV on a busy Las Vegas freeway on-ramp. According to the complaint, Newson then entered the SUV and fired seven times, including seven times through the victim\u2019s right cheek, chin, forearm, upper arm, and lower chest. The complaint alleges that Newson was acting frantic, irritated, and nervous at the time of the shooting, and that he had no shoes, a cell phone, or cell phone. The SEC also alleges that the couple fought frequently while driving, and the evidence presented in the case suggested that the defendant was under the influence of methamphetamine and hydrocodone, which may have caused her to act unreasonably or even threateningly. Newson also allegedly told the victim that she should delete text messages between herself and the victim for fear that the police might use those messages to link Newson to the death.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Newson.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of California entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Newson from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Newson has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to a five-year conduct-based suspension from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General of the Las Vegas Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
