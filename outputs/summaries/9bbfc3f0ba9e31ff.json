  "summary": "On July 10, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins a defendant from violating the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $34,500.  The court also ordered Mart\u00ednez to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of his sentence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed criminal charges in Puerto Rico.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the defendants pled guilty to an Article 401 possession-with-intent-to-distribute offense and were sentenced to 34 months in prison.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the judge had the burden of establishing that the defendant pled guilty during the plea colloquy to a prior felony conviction for an attempt/conspiracy to possess heroin with intent to distribute, in violation of the federal drug laws.  He also had the duty to determine whether to impose a penalty based on the defendant's prior conviction.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2017.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The judge also agreed to a five-year suspended sentence for an additional five years, which would be increased to a 30-year \"maximum\" term or decreased to a 10-year \u201cminimum\u201d term, depending on the circumstances of the alleged drug trafficking case.  Finally, the court agreed to the imposition of a 20-year prison sentence, which will be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Puerto Rico Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Office of Inspector General. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Criminal Investigations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background"
