  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California today entered a final judgment against Cal Fire, a Cal Fire fire district, and its former chief for defrauding the public.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, California, alleges that Cal Fire violated the antifraud provisions of Section 425 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Cal Fire employed Corey Baughn as a firefighter at its Ukiah Valley Fire District, where he was a member of the unit's board of directors, and he received a cease-and-desist letter from Cal Fire stating that he would not be present in Cal Fire's facilities when the victim complained to the fire chief about her conduct.  In a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed an emergency action to halt the alleged misconduct.  Cal Fire has agreed to settle the SEC's action by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of any civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Cal Fire and the union have agreed to a settlement that permanently restrains the Commission's action against them. The settlement is subject to court approval. The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael R. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and Cal Fire. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to identify whether they are registered professionals.
