  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Bankers Life & Casualty Co. and Western Helicopter Services in an elder financial abuse action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that Bankers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, defendants failed to pay insurance premiums to Bankers in exchange for insurance policies, and instead delayed and denied claims to be entitled to insurance benefits under the policies.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in imposing various impediments to their efforts to collect insurance benefits, Bankers delayed or denied claims for reasons that did not comport with the requirements of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.    In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Banker. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action on May 9, 2017, against the defendant for failing to pay his or her insurance premiums and failing to comply with a court order requiring him to return the money or property that he or she transferred to the vulnerable person.  This action is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 547-48, 204 P.3d 1038."
