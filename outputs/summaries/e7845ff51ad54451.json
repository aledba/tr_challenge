  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia today entered a final judgment in a case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Neil Chatterjee, the acting Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that, in 1977, the federal government transferred much of its regulatory authority to the then-defunct Federal Power Commission, which was responsible for vetting and approving construction of interstate natural gas pipelines and expansion of existing pipelines.  According to the complaint, the agency did not have jurisdiction to determine whether to grant a Certificate to Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC, an investment firm that was the subject of an SEC investigation.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the SEC improperly used administrative law judges as part of its enforcement efforts.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits, and require the defendants to pay civil penalties equal to their profits.  Additionally, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct an independent review of the matter.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of New York entered final judgments in Bennett v. SEC, finding that the agency had jurisdiction over the matter, without requiring a court to rule on the merits of the claims, that it had jurisdiction to issue a Certificate, and that a court of appeals could determine whether the agency should issue a judgment ordering the issuance of a Certificate.   The court also issued an order temporarily restraining the SEC from issuing or issuing any enforcement orders without a court-ordered injunction, and temporarily suspending the agency from issuing any orders related to the issuance or issuance of any such order. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Virginia Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
