  "summary": "The Chicago Fire Department Pension Board today announced that it has obtained a final judgment against a former paramedic and divisional aide who was denied a duty disability pension based on her alleged PTSD.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on June 21, 2017, a paramedic who was previously employed by the fire department was diagnosed with PTSD in 2010.  The complaint alleges that, on December 22, 2010, she was dispatched to the scene of a shooting where a large crowd stood by the body of a firefighter who had been shot in the head.  As alleged in the complaint, the plaintiff's PTSD symptoms persisted for several years after the events in December 2010 and October 2012, and she became hypervigilant, felt startled when the alarm at the firehouse sounded, experienced anxiety while on duty, and withdrew from relationships.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the paramedic, her supervisor, Assistant Chief James O'Connell, and her supervisor.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the Board agreed that the plaintiff did not have PTSD and that she was not disabled from performing her duties as a firefighter.  However, according to the Board's order, certain events in her personal life that occurred during her employment, including the end of a romantic relationship and the death of her grandmother, caused her to delay her ability to perform her duties and to withdraw from her romantic relationship.  On March 15, 2016, the court granted the Pension Board's request for a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered her to return to work.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, the Illinois State Auditor's Office, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations Division, the State Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General, the Division of Public Health and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson, Ms. Kelly, and Mr. Gaunt. The case has been supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Public Health Division.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages the public to check the background of anyone offering or offering them a job by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are professionals with a history of mental illness and to determine whether they have sufficient expertise to perform their duties."
