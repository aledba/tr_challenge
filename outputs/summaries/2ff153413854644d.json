  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of South Carolina today entered a final judgment against Merry Land Properties, LLC, a Rhode Island-based real estate development company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charleston, South Carolina on November 8, 2007, Merry Land and its owner, Gregory Baisch, raised the issue of whether the property was entitled to a \"right, title, or interest\" under the federal and state laws.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to these representations, Hoyler failed to adequately consider the nature of the property and the reasons why the property should not be included in the proposed community marina.  In a parallel action, on January 31, 2011, the court granted the master's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Merry Land to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the master consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins Merry Land from participating in any future municipal development proceeding, including municipal development projects, and orders the master to provide a copy of the deed to the disputed marsh for the purpose of obtaining a \"critical area permit.\"  The final judgment also prohibits Merry Land, Baisch and the adjacent property owners from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer in connection with any municipal development project, and bars Hoyler from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Further, the order prohibits the purchase, sale, alteration, or destruction of any property in violation of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, including the right to reapply after five years of litigation.  Additionally, the judgment prohibits the acquisition and destruction of property by any third party without reasonable cause, and prohibits the destruction of or alteration of any of the properties in question.  For further information, see S.C. Dep't of Highways & Pub. Transp. No. 567, 355 S.E.2d (1911) and No. 17(b)(5) of Greenbelt, Wis. (1913).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson, Ms. Werner, and Mr. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Internal Revenue Service."
