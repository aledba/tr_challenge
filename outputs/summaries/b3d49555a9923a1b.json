  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against Baltimore City resident Daquan Middleton, who was found guilty of three felony counts of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first- and second-degree felony murder, and first-and-second-degree assault. The court also found that Middleton was not liable for the charges in the indictment, and instead was liable for a four-year suspended sentence for robbery, consecutive to that for the assault; and a three-year suspension from the criminal justice system for the same conduct. Middleton also was found liable for first- degree felony murder for a separate felony, and for second- and third-degree criminal charges. The Court of Appeals also found Middleton guilty of first and second degree murder. The SEC's final judgment, which was entered on May 24, 2016, ordered Middleton to pay a total of $1,965.95 in restitution, a penalty equal to the amount of his criminal conviction, and a civil penalty of $750,000.  Middleton consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, which is subject to court approval. The final judgment orders Middleton disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil monetary penalty, a bar against Middleton and a penny stock bar against him, and an officer and director bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The judgment also imposes a five-year bar on Middleton.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Maryland today announced criminal charges against Ponsi, Middleton's father, and Eldridge.  The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the return of Middleton from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Baltimore Regional Office.  On May 25, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, charging Middleton with one count of attempted murder, with the SEC requiring him to pay restitution of $2,958.95, and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the securities industry. The complaint also names Craig Pearly as a defendant for the purpose of recovering his stolen bicycle.  According to the SEC, Pearly and Middleton agreed to settle the case by agreeing to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws. Pearly also agreed to a 10-year prison term."
