  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans today entered a final judgment against a former Harbor Police officer who was charged with stealing a gun from his father.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Antione Ferbos of Harbor, New Orleans and his partner, Miles Guirreri of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office, falsely told the court that he was aware of a recent car burglary in the area and that a gun was stolen in the car burglary. The complaint further alleges that he called the precinct to have the victim brought to the scene to possibly identify the gun. According to the complaint, the victim told the officer that she saw the gun fall out of M.B.'s pants as he struggled with his father on the sidewalk, and that her husband picked up the gun and subsequently handed it to the officer. The court agreed to the final judgment, which permanently enjoins Ferbos from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Ferbos to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his sentence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans announced criminal charges against Ferbos. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's New Orleans Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Inspector General, and the Louisiana Department of Justice in this matter."
