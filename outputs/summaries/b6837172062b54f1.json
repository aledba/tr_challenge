  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Washington today entered a temporary restraining order against a Washington, D.C., licensed clinical psychologist and her husband, Eric D. Volkert, who is also a licensed, practicing, and licensed psychologist, from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Seattle on September 5, 2012, former medical professional Elizabeth A. Ziegler, Ph.D., provided her expert opinion on the subject of a federal court order requiring her to produce medical reports and review her own medical records. The complaint alleges that, in reviewing her own files, she opined that there was no objective evidence of concussion or mild TBI stemming from the accident, and that she could not find support for such a diagnosis in her medical records from the day of the event.  The complaint further alleges that Zieler failed to inform her treating doctors that she had received a doctor-patient testimonial privilege, which prohibits her from disclosing medical information to anyone other than her own treating physician.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Kasper and supervised by Marc Blau. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Washington Office of Inspector General. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
