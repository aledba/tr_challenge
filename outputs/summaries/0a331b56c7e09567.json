  "summary": "On February 20, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah entered a final judgment against the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, filed on July 23, 2015, the Tribe filed a complaint in federal court in Utah alleging that the federal district court lacked jurisdiction over the Tribe's claims.  The complaint alleges that, after accepting full performance under the contract, the tribe refused to pay Becker a penalty equal to the amount owed to the federal court.  As alleged in the complaint, Becker has raised preemption and sovereignty as federal defenses, and that the state court has no jurisdiction to determine whether there is federal jurisdiction.  In its final judgment, the court found that the Tribe violated the federal preemption provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13d-1 thereunder, and granted the Tribe a temporary restraining order, an emergency court order, and an order requiring the Tribe to return to the reservation.  Without admitting or denying the tribe's allegations, the United States Attorney's Office for Utah today announced criminal charges against Becker.   The SEC's complaint charges the Tribe with violations of the federal securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On February 24, 2017, the Honorable Judge Barry G. Lawrence of the Utah Court of Appeals issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the litigation in this matter.  Judge Lawrence also issued a preliminary injunction against the Tribe, which is subject to court approval, ordering the receiver to send a copy of the complaint to the receiver, and ordering an expedited hearing for the Tribe on February 26, 2018.
