  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendants in an honest services wire fraud case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that, while serving as mayor of Richardson, Laura Jordan exchanged votes on apartment development projects for cash, sex, and luxury hotel stays, among other benefits from fellow defendant Mark Jordan, the apartment developer.  According to the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal bribery and kickback statutes, and ordered them to submit new jury instructions that would determine whether to charge them with violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants agreed to permanent injunctions, to be barred from participating in any federal bribery scheme, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 or more.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against Laura Jordan and Mark Jordan in connection with the same scheme.  As alleged, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder, and that the jury instructions violated the anti-bribery provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d).  The court also found that, in Skilling's case, a federal district court erred in its finding that a state official cannot be charged with a bribe pursuant to a federal bribery or kickback statute.  Skilling also was found liable for a civil injunctive action for violating the same conduct, and the court granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.   The Court's order also prohibits the defendants from violating any federal law, including the securities laws, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amounts of $5,000 and $1,000, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 24, 2019).  In its order, the Court also issued an order requiring the jury to consider the nature of any bribe, whether it was a bribe, a kickback, or additional conduct such as the receipt of gratuities.  It also ordered the defendants not to violate the federal laws, including Section"
