  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a California man who claimed to be the father of a child conceived and born to another man.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City on December 27, 2012, Michael M.L. \"Mark\" Suedi, a California resident, and his wife, Dawn D. (\"Dawn D\"), were romantically involved when Donald was conceived and the child was born.  The complaint alleges that, while raising the child, Victor impregnated Mary, who was not married at the time of the child's birth.  As alleged in the complaint, Mary and Roger brought Donald into their home as their son and have prevented Victor from having contact with the child.  After discovering the child and making unsuccessful efforts to establish his paternity, Victor filed a second petition seeking an order quashing the action.  In its judgment, the court held that, despite his best efforts he was prevented by Mary from doing so and that he has nonetheless \"openly held out the child as his natural child\" and attempted to assume the obligations of parenthood.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the SEC consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The court also granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, which is subject to court approval. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Gabriel P. and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by G. David Fraser.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U. S. Secret Service in this matter."
