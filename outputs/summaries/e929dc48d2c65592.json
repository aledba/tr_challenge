  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of North Carolina today announced charges against a North Carolina man for his role in a high-speed car chase that resulted in the death of a government official.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Tomonta Simmons violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the SEC's findings, Simmons was not criminally liable for any of the alleged violations of the federal, state, and local laws, and that he was not a factor in the decision to revoke Simmons\u2019s supervised release.  According to the complaint, the court improperly classified Simmons as a \"crimes of violence\" when, in fact, he was a passenger, not the driver of the car involved in the alleged assault.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Simmons consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the federal and state securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of 30 to 36 months, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the United States.  In a parallel action, the Department of Justice today announced criminal charges against Simmons arising from the same conduct that led to the suspension of his supervised release, which was later announced by the SEC as a result of a related administrative proceeding.  To learn more about supervised release laws, see Press Release Release No. 598 (4th Cir. 2016).
