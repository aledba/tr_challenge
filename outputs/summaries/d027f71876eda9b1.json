  "summary": "On March 29, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a Long Beach, New York-based landlord for failing to pay rent in a summary proceeding.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Long Beach on April 12, 2016 and unsealed on April 19, 2017, Defendant Charlene Cordero of Long Beach sought to recover rent owed by a tenant who entered into a so-called settlement without counsel.  The complaint alleges that the landlord, Rippy New York, LLC, agreed to pay $136,371.31 in rent and additional rent, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the landlord from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the landlord to pay a civil penalty of $1,700.00.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the landlord.  As alleged, the court granted the landlord's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered a hearing on the matter, and issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.  On May 24, 2016 a federal district court in New York granted the relief sought by the landlord and ordered the receiver to comply with the court's order.  A hearing scheduled for May 26, 2016 is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Long Beach Housing Authority, and the Nassau County Department of Social Services in this matter.
