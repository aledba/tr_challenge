  "summary": "On May 20, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a judgment against Bernard S. Black for defrauding his sister, Joanne Black, who suffers from a long-standing mental illness.  The court found that, before Renata Black died, he had violated his fiduciary duties to her by failing to disclose the effect of the disclaimer on Joanne's well-documented interest in the nearly $3.5 million in assets from which he stole from her.  According to the court's order, the defendants agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of three times the amount they received from each of the trusts.  In addition, the court granted Mr. Black's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered a forensic accounting, held a multiday evidentiary hearing, and ultimately concluded that the defendants had breached their fiduciaries duties to Joanne.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Ms. Litvak and her husband, Samuel Black, filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants on August 8, 2018, seeking a judgment ordering them to vacate the agreed judgment.  On November 7, 2017, a federal district court in Denver entered an agreed judgment against all three of these trusts for the full amount of $376,464.88 that was owed to Ms. Black by her sister, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and ordered to pay $13,000 in legal fees and costs.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Northern Illinois, alleges that, on January 29, 2016, the defendant and his sister filed a complaint for declaratory relief against a Colorado court for the purpose of granting an asset freeze and ordering the judgment to stand as to the third trust.  As alleged in the complaint, the judgment in this case was improper because Joanne was not a beneficiary of the trust and therefore had no rights to any of the assets in the trust, and that the judgment was a product of fraud or collusion.  Additionally, the complaint alleged that, in a parallel action, the same day, the Colorado court granted the defendants' motion for relief, they sought a judgment granting the judgment against each of those trusts, agreeing to the judgment for the benefit of the defendants, and to pay a $4 million civil penalty.  This settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John R. Rymas and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office."
