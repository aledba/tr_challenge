  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against Jason Lewandowski, a former Day County Sheriff, who was convicted of first- and second-degree felony murder, commission of a felony while armed with a firearm, and burglary in the first degree stemming from the shooting death of Jeremy Hendrickson (Jeremy).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fargo, North Dakota, alleges that, on July 21, 2012, Lewandowski claimed he aggravated his injuries when he tripped and fell in a ditch after deer hunting.  According to the complaint, after learning about the shooting, he confronted his brother about it and confronted him about it.  The complaint alleges that Lewandowski replied, \u201cI'm sorry, sorry man,\u201d put his.22 caliber pistol to Jeremy\u2019s head and shot him in the head.

He also claimed that the State improperly withdrew the plea agreement later that evening after the victim's family objected to the terms of the agreement.  Finally, he claimed that he had a continuing \"right to remain silent and stop questioning at any time.\"  The court found that the state breached a plea agreement at the time it entered the agreement, and that it should have suppressed the statements he made to Lunzman on the night of the shooting.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, the state failed to adequately consider Lewandowski's intoxication and impaired mental state in its decision to suppress those statements.  For example, the SEC alleges that the defendant had previously waived his Miranda rights and was not suffering from any hallucinations or delusions when he was questioned by Lunzman.
