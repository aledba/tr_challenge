  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans today entered a final judgment against D90 Energy, LLC, a Louisiana-based oil and gas company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, alleges that D90's failure to pay its taxes on three oil-and-gas wells and one saltwater disposal well in Jefferson Davis Parish was a violation of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, D90 failed to file a valid valuation of the wells when it was required to do so by the SEC.  D90 also failed to timely respond to the SEC's order for reimbursement of taxes paid under protest for 2015 and 2016.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against the company, its owner, and two other individuals.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint filed in the federal court for the Western District, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins D90 from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and orders the company to pay disgorgement of $1,821,213, prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil monetary penalty of a total of $160,000.   The court also ordered D90 to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which is equal to the amount of any civil penalty paid by the company.  Finally, the Court issued a temporary restraining order, which prohibits D90 and its owner from commenting on the merits of the case or making any recommendations to the court regarding the appropriate course of action.  On June 2, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Gershfeld of the U.N. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order imposing a $75,000 penalty on D90, ordering him to pay $20,000 in restitution, and imposing a civil penalties of $50,000 each. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the New Orleans Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner."
