  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Utah today entered final judgments against Utah ski resort operators for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that the Utah State Board of Directors (Board of Directors) improperly held that ski area operators are entitled to a duty of reasonable care for injuries caused by skiing related to the inherent risks of skiing.  According to the complaint, the board of directors previously held that liability for skiing-related injuries was a \"fundamental right\" of a ski resort operator.  In fact, according to the court's order, the Board had no duty of care to determine whether a ski area operator was entitled to liability for any of the above-mentioned risks.  Instead, the court held that a preinjury release by a parent on behalf of a skier constitutes an inherent risk of skiing, and that a reasonable amount of care should be required to offset any potential injury caused by that injury.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's action, theBoard has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the Board from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and orders the Board to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  It also imposes a $75,000 civil penalty against the board.   The court also agreed to a partial injunction against future violations, which will be determined by the court at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Farrow and supervised by Scott A. Birkenheier of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Office of Insurance Regulation, the Utah Department of Natural Resources, and the Utah Division of Health and Human Services in this matter."
