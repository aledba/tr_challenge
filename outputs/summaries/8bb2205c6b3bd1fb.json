  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against a New Bedford, Massachusetts man accused of helping an undercover FBI agent smuggle $10,000 out of the country for his own use.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that Antonio Freitas, a former FBI agent assigned to the agency's Boston field office, provided false testimony to a federal judge about the nature of the bulk-cash smuggling and currency structuring provisions of the federal securities laws. Freitas allegedly told the judge that he and a Portuguese man named \"Lenny\" wanted to buy Carlos Seafood, a commercial-fishing business located in New Bedford. The complaint alleges that Freitas agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a $17,500 civil penalty and a $1,000 officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Freitas also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Freitas on two counts of securities fraud and one count of aiding and abetting a foreign agent's conduct in connection with the bulk cash smuggling. The final judgment orders Freitas to comply with the court's orders and pay a civil penalty of $17.5 million. The court granted Freitas's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return to the field of law enforcement. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Massachusetts Department of Justice in this matter."
