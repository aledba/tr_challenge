  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) and its director of environmental health and safety control (collectively, DTSC).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that, in 2008 and 2009, the California Secretary of State's Office (\"DOSTC\") issued an order requiring the Department of Environmental Health and Safety Control to perform an environmental assessment and cleanup program under Chapter 6.5 of the federal environmental law for releases from hazardous waste facilities.  According to the complaint, the DOE&rsquo;s order required the DOE to perform the cleanup, including by way of the site's closure or postclosure plan.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the DSTC's complaint or its findings, the department of health, safety and well-being consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the DOE from violating the federal antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the DOE and DTSc to issue an order to expedite the cleanup.  The court also granted the SEC's request for a writ of mandamus, a temporary restraining order, and an order appointing a receiver for the site.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Soco West, Inc., a California-based waste treatment company, for its role in the alleged violations of Section 25187 of the state's Environmental Quality Act.  On June 26, 1995, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the company, alleging that it violated Section 25189, and that it had abused its \"discretion\" by refusing to transfer oversight of the cleanup of a hazardous waste site from Chapter 6 to Chapter 6,8.  It also alleged that the company violated Sections 25187 and 25356, by failing to comply with its obligations under the federal reporting requirements of Section 5 of the code.  Finally, the complaint alleges that the DOE violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 6(d) thereunder and that the DTDC violated Section 5(b)(1) and (3) of that federal reporting provision.  As a result of the litigation, the company has agreed to settle the case against it by consenting to the issuance of a court order requiring it to do an independent, expedited, and cost-effective accounting of the waste"
