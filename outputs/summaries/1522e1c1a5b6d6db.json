  "summary": "The Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order to revoke the licenses of a Pennsylvania barber, barber manager, and barber teacher.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, alleges that the Pennsylvania Board of Professional and Occupational Affairs (BPA) improperly revoked the barber licenses of two individuals who had been convicted of felonies.  According to the complaint, Kevin A. King, a barber who was sentenced to 5 to 10 years of incarceration for a felony that occurred in Illinois seven years earlier, was not rehabilitated and was not permitted to practice as a licensed barber.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services (DOH) today issued an order requiring the revocation of King's barber license.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, King consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  King has agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar and director bar.  He has also agreed to be permanently enjoined from associating with any person with a history of felony or of a prior felony conviction, from participating in any form of employment, from raising children, to practicing as an attorney, to participating in community service, to serving as a public health professional.  Additionally, King agreed to the appointment of a hearing examiner to determine whether a penalty should be imposed upon him based on his prior criminal conviction.   The court granted the request for a temporary restraining order against King and ordered him to return to the barbershop where he was previously employed.  A hearing examiner will determine whether to impose a penalty based on King's past criminal convictions and whether to issue an order suspending or otherwise imposing a penalty upon him. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office and the Pennsylvania State Board of Education in this matter."
