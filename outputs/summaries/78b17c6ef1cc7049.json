  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Cameron R. Pearson, a trustee of a limited partnership in a Delaware limited partnership, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17-305 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on January 14, 2019, plaintiff, in his capacity as trustee as a general partner of Pearson Investments Limited Partnership (Pearson Investments), claimed that he had the right to an accounting under the federal securities laws because he was a \"partner in a general partnership.\"  The complaint further alleges that, as trustee of both trusts, he was simply seeking an order regarding the administration of that trust upon his death.  In a parallel action, on March 22, 2018, a federal district court in the District of Columbia entered a judgment that permanently enjoins plaintiff from future violations of the securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of $10,858,673, prejudgment interest of $1,046,003, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
