  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Social Security Administration v. John Westley Tate Jr.'s (\u201cDefendant\u201d) motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against him.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 9, 2013, Tate, who was born in 1956, became unable to work due to a medical condition that prevented him from engaging in any substantial gainful activity.  The complaint alleges that on September 17, 2012, on the date of the alleged onset date, he became incapacitated and disabled.  As alleged in the complaint, the complaint alleged that on that date, the claimant suffered from a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that prohibits him from performing work that he performed in the past.  In a parallel action, on November 13, 2018, the SEC issued an order requiring Social Security to respond to a complaint filed by Tate's family member alleging that he had suffered a serious spinal cord injury.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Tate consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the Department of Health and Human Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
