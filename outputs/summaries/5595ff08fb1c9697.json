  "summary": "On February 13, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio entered a final judgment against R.A., a juvenile delinquent who entered an admission to the Ohio Department of Youth Services without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the complaint.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ohio on January 25, 2018 and unsealed on February 26, 2018 in the Eastern District of Washington, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The court also issued an order requiring the defendant to show cause and effect to withdraw his admission.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against the defendant.  On January 24, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David G. Miller, Kelly L. Gibson, Patrick J. McCluskey, and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Miller and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Attorney General's Office, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov\u00a0to quickly identify people selling investments using the SEC\u00c2\u00a0investigations tool.  For example, on November 8, 2017, a federal district court in Dayton, Ohio entered an order granting a temporary restraining order against a defendant from entering an admission that would impair his ability to appeal the decision of the trial court. The court's order granted the request for a temporary injunction against further violations, and ordered the defendant's release from the institution of his or her criminal conviction.
