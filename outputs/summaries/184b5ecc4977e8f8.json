  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against two Atlanta residents for their role in a scheme to steal millions of dollars from government contracts.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, on January 3, 2019, the District Court in Atlanta issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order suspending the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder. The court also ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $200,000.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to file tax returns for the years in which they received bribes in exchange for receiving government contracts, and failed to disclose to the court that the payments were not \"bribes.\"  The complaint further alleges that Anthony Roper, the managing partner of Platinum Tax Associates, failed to inform the court of his receipt of the bribes.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Roper consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to pay civil penalties of $100,000, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  Roper also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued a final order suspending her from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On July 10, 2019 the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a penalty equal to the amount of her sentence. The SEC also instituted an investigation, which was conducted by Michael J. Mitsven and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Roper and Ms. Burt of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit."
