  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of Sacramento in a related case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Sacramento, California, on March 13, 2014, the city of Sacramento approved the McKinley Village project.  The complaint alleges that the city failed to adequately analyze the impact of the project on the surrounding neighborhood, particularly the potential for off-site subsurface gas migration.  As alleged in the complaint, the project is inconsistent with the city's general plan, which requires that projects with significant environmental impacts be included in the overall plan.  For example, the complaint alleges the project would cause significant increases in the number of cars and trucks driving through the neighborhood.  In a parallel action, the California Department of Commerce today announced that it has issued an order requiring the city to provide an EIR on the project, which is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the City has agreed to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  It has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years, with the right to reapply after five years.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Mascianica, and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Secretary of State's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
