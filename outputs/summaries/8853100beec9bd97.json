  "summary": "The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing administrative proceeding against Sunrise Energy, LLC (Sunrise).  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Pennsylvania, alleges that First Energy and Sunrise violated the attorney-work-product privilege by failing to disclose emails sent to and from counsel for First Energy in response to a PUC request for documents related to an ongoing litigation between Sunrise and First Energy.  According to the complaint, First Energy, which is not a party to the litigation, generated at least 64 emails that were responsive to the PUC's request.  The complaint further alleges that the emails were drafted and sent by counsel for Sunrise, for the purpose of representing the client's shared interest in representing First Energy's legal position on jurisdiction under the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standards Act (AEPS Act) and that, with respect to those emails, the defendants did not have standing to challenge the disclosure of those emails because they shared a common legal interest with First Energy that was not protected by the AEPS Act.

In a parallel action, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania today issued an order suspending Sunrise from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney in the public interest litigation proceeding.   The order also prohibits Sunrise from providing access to certain documents that are not subject to disclosure under the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, such as records that are the work-product of an attorney.  Additionally, the order prohibits First Energy or its counsel from providing records to the Commission in anticipation of litigation or trial, and from providing any assistance to a Commission in the Commission's investigation of the matter.  Finally, the court granted Sunrise's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the Commission from issuing subpoenas, from accessing documents in the possession of a Commonwealth-issued subpoena, from issuing an order requiring the Commission to obtain a copy of any subpoena or other emergency order, from making any material public, from entering or entering into an agreement with a Commission member, to"
