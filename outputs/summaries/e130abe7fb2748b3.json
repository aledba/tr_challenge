  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against four correctional officers for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that on October 4, 2012, correctional officers used excessive force in an incident in which a handcuffed Waddleton was \"slam[ed] on the ground\" by Salinas, Rodriguez, and an unknown officer. The complaint also alleges that, on three separate occasions, the officers used force to restrain Waddell, who complained of pain in his wrists and left ankle, and that he was \"pissed off.\" The complaint further alleges that the officers did not respond to the officers\u2019 requests for a copy of the video, which was not available to the court at the time of the alleged misconduct. The SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in federal district court in Corpus Christi, Texas, charges the four officers with violating the anti-fascism provisions of the federal securities laws. The defendants have consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating these provisions, and order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars. The court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, which is subject to court approval. The order also prohibits the officers from imposing any monetary penalty or bar them from serving as officers or directors of a public company. The administrative proceeding against the four defendants is continuing.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney General's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against each of the defendants.  According to the SEC, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order and an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, and the Texas State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
