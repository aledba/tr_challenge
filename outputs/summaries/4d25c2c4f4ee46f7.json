  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Deon M. Rice, a former Burger King employee who was charged with aiding and abetting a third person's unlawful use of a weapon.  According to the SEC's complaint, on August 29, 2016, Rice was working at a Burger King restaurant in South St. Louis City when a group of six men entered the restaurant and engaged in fistfights with members of another group. The complaint alleges that Rice, who was in an intimate relationship with Jerome Hawkins-Shaw and believed that he had cheated on him with Young, began to drive across town with the men, telling them that he should have a fistfight with them and that he would kill them if they brought a fight to the apartment building. Rice and two other men, Lerrenzo Young, and Jeronc\u00e9 Evans, followed Rice and Evans, but did not follow Rice. Rice also allegedly used a crowbar to strike Young\u2019s vehicle.  The SEC alleges that the jury found Rice guilty of first-degree involuntary manslaughter, second-degree felony murder, and unlawful possession of a firearm. Rice was sentenced to seven years in prison and three years for armed criminal action, to run concurrently with the other defendants, for a total of nine years. The SEC also found Rice liable as an accomplice to the third person in the fistfight.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Rice.  On August 31, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action charging Rice with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-1 thereunder. Rice pleaded guilty to one count of felony manslaughter and was ordered to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The court granted the SEC request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, and ordered Rice to surrender his passport. Rice has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $7,500, which is equal to the civil penalty. Rice will also be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security measure. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for September 13, 2018."
