  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a Texas man who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in El Paso, Texas, alleges that N.C.S., a Texas resident, and his wife, A.E.M., of Dallas, violated Section 161 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The complaint alleges that the Department of Human Services failed to adequately evaluate the safety and well-being of the children and failed to inform the children of the dangers posed by drug use, domestic violence, and other drug-related criminal activity. According to the complaint, the defendants continued to use marijuana and methamphetamine even though the trial court had found that Nick was unable to provide for the children's basic needs or to protect them from the endangering environment in Ava's home. In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Nick. The SEC also announced that it had obtained a temporary restraining order against Nick, ordering him to submit to a drug test, and appointing a licensed child-placing agency as managing conservator. The court's order, which is subject to court approval, requires the court to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify the termination of parental rights to the children.  In its order, the court also ordered the Department to consider whether there was any reasonable basis for the termination order to be instituted. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Health and Human Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. The\u00c2\u00a0SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can quickly and easily identify people who are not registered professionals by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Advisers.gov website to quickly identify people with whom they may want to invest in investing in investments."
