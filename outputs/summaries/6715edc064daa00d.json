  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a defendant who agreed to withdraw his guilty plea in a parallel criminal case.  According to the SEC's complaint, on September 25, 2012, Officer Jeffrey Stratman of the Fairview Heights Police Department conducted a traffic stop on a motor vehicle driven by the defendant. The complaint alleges that, on the morning of the stop, Stratman stopped the defendant for failing to signal before changing lanes. As alleged in the complaint, the defendant replied to the officer's question by saying that he understood that the officer was acting in performance of official duties when he stopped him. As the complaint alleges, however, he was led to believe by his defense attorney that he did not signal when he did, and the officer had completed a warning ticket for the same violation. As a result of the traffic stop and subsequent seizure, the defendants were not able to present a valid defense. The SEC alleges that Stratman and his K-9 partner, Larry Flinn, entered into a partial agreement to withdraw the defendant's guilty plea without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by Amy Gwiazda. The case has been supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Chicago Division of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois State Attorney's Office in this matter."
