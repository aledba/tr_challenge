  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Alfred E. \"Alfred\" Plance, Jr., a Pennsylvania resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, Alfred, Jr. of Pennsylvania, owned a 146-acre farm in which he and his wife, Joy, raised concerns about the legitimacy of Alfred's will.  The complaint alleges that Alfred failed to record the deeds, which were submitted to the court as proof that Alfred had revoked his will and, therefore, died intestate.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Alfred consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Alfred.  On August 20, 2014, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Alfred and ordered him to comply with the court's order that he comply with, and consent to, a cease-and-desist order from Alfred, as well as an order appointing a receiver for Alfred's farm.  Alfred also agreed to the appointment of a receiver, and agreed to be barred by the court from issuing an order requiring him to cease and desist from issuing or selling any security or other security in his or her possession.  As a result of the Court's order, Alfred was barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after five years.  Timothy agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with interest, pay civil penalties, and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The court also ordered Alfred to surrender his farm to the receiver, who would then be responsible for the receiver's purchase and sale of the farm, and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  To settle the matter, Alfred agreed to a permanent injunction prohibiting him from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in the sale or purchase of a security or any other security, and that the receiver would be required to provide a copy of the deed to Alfred in the event of an emergency.  This settlement is subject to court approval. "
