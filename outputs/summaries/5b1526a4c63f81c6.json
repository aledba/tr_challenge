  "summary": "On August 31, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana entered final judgments against GoAuto Insurance Company (GoAuto) and Robert Newman (\u201cMr. Newman\u201d) in a civil injunctive action brought by the SEC.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that GoAuto and Mr. Newman violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, on May 3, 2017, Mr. Herron was stopped for a red light in the turn lane of Louisiana Highway 116 when he and his passenger, Dr. Bradley Kirzner, were stopped by GoAuto for a stop-and-go violation of the federal securities laws. The complaint alleges that immediately after impact, the car rolled backwards, striking the truck of the other driver. The SEC alleges that shortly after the accident, Ms. Alla and her husband, James Herron, left the scene without calling or waiting for the police, and shortly after, the truck rear-ended the other car.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Go Auto and Mr., Newman.  On August 31 the SEC filed an amended complaint, seeking permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, GoAuto agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the charged provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $17,500.00. The settlement is subject to court approval.  GoAuto also agreed to pay $15,000.00 in civil penalties and to a $20,000 civil penalty. In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC charged GoAuto with liability for a separate automobile accident in which it and its passenger, Robert Newman, were involved in a serious automobile accident. The court also found GoAuto liable for liability for an amount in excess of the company's contractual automobile insurance policy limits.  To learn more about liability, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018."
