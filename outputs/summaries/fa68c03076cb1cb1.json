  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Yazan Aledamat, a California resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles on October 22, 2016, the court improperly permitted the jury to determine whether a box cutter was an inherently deadly weapon.  The complaint alleges that, in October 2016, defendant approached a woman working at a lunch truck and asked her for her phone number; she declined, explaining that she had \"very hot\" and \"had a big ass.\"  The court found that, because the defendant did not use the box cutter as a deadly weapon, the jury could not determine whether it had \"actually\" relied upon the valid theory.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Aledamanat.  On November 5, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in the District of Columbia issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering the court to issue an order temporarily restraining defendants from violating the above-mentioned provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule\u00c2\u00a05(b)(2) thereunder, ordering Aledabanat to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against him from further violations of Section 5(b).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Los Angeles Police Department, and the California Department of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
