  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against defendant Alonzo M. Ponzi, Jr., who was convicted of a series of auto burglaries and placed on probation.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 19, 2018, in the Lytton Casino parking lot in San Pablo, Calif., a 17-year-old Oakland resident was arrested by a San Leandro Police Department officer who conducted an electronic search of his car. The complaint alleges that the officer found a purse that matched the description of a purse stolen from a victim of a similar car theft earlier that day.  The complaint further alleges that one of the men had recently stopped smoking marijuana, and the other two were boasting about making money.  As alleged in the complaint, the officer had met the two individuals through a group of friends in Oakland, did not know them well, and had not yet had the opportunity to engage in any criminal activity.  In addition, the complaint alleged that the two men had engaged in a pattern of stealing purses and other miscellaneous items, including a Chevrolet Camaro, Lexus and Dodge, and that the three men had committed multiple felony burglaries in two different counties and that they had recently secured jobs in Las Vegas.  Alona P. told the probation officer that he was going back and forth between Oakland and Las Vegas because of the negative influences he fell under the sway of.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against him.    The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the San Francisco Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Market Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the California State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the California Office of Inspector General."
