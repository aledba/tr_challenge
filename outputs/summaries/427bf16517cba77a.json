  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Verizon Wireless, LLC, a Florida-based telecommunications company, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, Florida, alleges that, in 2011, Christopher Bateman obtained cell phone service from Verizon through his company, Five Points Health Care Ltd. (\"Five Points\"). According to the complaint, Mr. Bateman agreed to the terms of a customer agreement that included an arbitration provision that would require the parties to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $568.02 per month. The complaint further alleges that the arbitration provision was inconsistent with the agreed-upon settlement provisions of the customer agreement, and that the parties could not compel arbitration if they had agreed to do so.  In a parallel action, the United States Bankruptcy Commission today announced that it has issued an order suspending or canceling the service of five telemarketers, including five Florida-area telecom companies.  On August 2, 2014, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and entered an order freezing the assets of five telecom companies, including Five Points and Five Points, and ordering them to pay civil penalties of up to $1.5 million.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from violating the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount owed to them by the parties in the complaint.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 587, 593 (Mar. \u00c2\u00a0Aug. 2, 2016).  The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Gaunt. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Secretary of State's Office."
