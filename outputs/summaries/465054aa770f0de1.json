  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California yesterday entered a final judgment against Caltrans, the state agency that administers the federal securities laws, for failing to establish design immunity under Section 830.6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that Caltrans failed to establish the discretionary approval element of the design immunity provision of the federal law.  According to the complaint, in 1992, 2002, and 2011, Caltrans designed and executed a four-lane divided expressway with the intention of adding rumble strips on the shoulders.  In 2011, the complaint alleged that Rajendra, a civil engineer who approved the plans, did not consider the rumble strip when he or she reviewed and approved those plans.  As alleged, Rajendra also stated in his declaration that he did not \"consider\" the use of rumble strips.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Caltrans from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Caltrans to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Caltrans has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  It also has agreed to a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 12a-1, and 12b2-2 thereunder.  A hearing on the proposed settlement is scheduled for May 24, 2018.  On May 25, 2018, the Honorable Judge Steven G. Burt of the San Diego Regional Office issued a temporary restraining order halting the issuance of the final judgment, ordering the SEC to provide an accounting of the amount of alleged injuries, the number of vehicles involved in the accident, and the manner in which the injured were injured will be determined by the court at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Transportation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Homeland Security, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the California Secretary of State's Office (DOA) for their assistance in this matter.
