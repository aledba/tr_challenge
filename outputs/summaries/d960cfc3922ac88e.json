  "summary": "On July 6, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Cellspin Soft, Inc., a microcap company, and four other companies for allegedly violating the antifraud provisions of the federal patents.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Cellspin, along with two companies, Fitbit, Moov, and GoPro, falsely claimed that their products could automatically transfer and publish data from a smartphone to a mobile device.  According to the complaint, however, these claims were not patent eligible because they did not apply to a specific technology.  Instead, the complaint alleges, Cellspin and the companies claimed that they had developed a way to transfer data from one device to another without having to use any of the patented technologies.  In fact, the SEC alleges that the companies had not developed any such technology, and that none of the asserted patents were patent eligible.  For example, according to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. failed to mention that Apple had not patented any of its products, and Apple and Amazon did not have any patents eligible for patent protection under the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Apple and Moov agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Apple also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the charged provisions and to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of its profits.  Finally, the court granted the companies\u2019 motion for summary judgment, which is subject to court approval, to the issuance of a permanent injunction, freezing the defendants\u2019 assets, and ordering them to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million and $2 million, respectively.  Additionally, the defendants agreed to the appointment of a receiver to facilitate the transfer of data between devices, and to be subject to a court order requiring them to provide a copy of the data to be sent to the receiver.  On June 5, 2019, the District Court granted the defendants a temporary restraining order, ordering Apple to pay a $1,500 civil penalty, and requiring Apple to comply with the court order.  Separately, the companies agreed to pay an $8 million civil penalty and to the payment of a $500,000 civil penalty.   The settlements are pending approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
