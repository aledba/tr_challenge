  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against defendant Carlos Avena, Jr. for his role in two carjacking homicides.  According to the SEC's complaint, Avena was the only defendant who was ever sentenced to the death penalty.  The SEC alleges that Avena had a long, documented history of drug use, a difficult childhood, and a history of violence.  Avena allegedly used PCP and marijuana to commit the three carjackings.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendant was a \"killing machine\" with a long history of abuse at the hands of his father, a \"wetback,\" and a \"cancer\" that must be removed before it can be cured.  In a parallel action, the California Court of Appeals today issued an order suspending Avena from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On May 24, 2016, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Avena and ordered him to return to the United States to be sentenced to death.   The court also ordered Avena to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar, as well as disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $2,500 and $500,000, respectively.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC in its order suspending the SEC from issuing an order imposing an injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Avena has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, and orders him to pay $1.5 million in civil penalties.  A hearing on May 25, 2016 was scheduled for 11:30 a.m. EST.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 522-23, July 17, 2016. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Attorney General's Office, the U. S. Attorney\u2018s Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
