  "summary": "On August 25, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the SEC's motion for summary judgment against the defendants.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to adequately monitor and record investments in the Vanderbilt University Retirement Plan and Vanderbilt University New Faculty Plan.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to adequately record investments with excessive fees and failed to monitor and remove imprudent investments.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, for years, Defendants, for example, retained investments with high expenses and poor performance relative to other investment options that had five years of historical underperformance.  As alleged, the Defendants also failed to maintain a record-keeping arrangement in which certain investments had to be included and could not be removed from the Plan, even if they were no longer prudent investments, and in which the Plan was prevented from using alternative record-keepers who could provide superior services at a lower cost.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The judgment also orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the court will determine whether to impose a penny stock bar against each defendant and whether to issue a civil injunctive relief order.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2017."
