  "summary": "On October 11, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Bonnie Shain, a retired physical education teacher who sought accidental disability retirement benefits based on injuries sustained on January 9, 2014.  The court found that Shain was not totally and permanently disabled from the traumatic brain injury, and that she was capable of performing her duties as a teacher.  According to the court's order, Shain filed an administrative proceeding on September 7, 2017 against the Board of Trustees, Public Employees' Retirement System, and the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) for the purpose of determining whether to suspend or revoke Shain's right to reapply for her pension.  In its order, the court also ordered Shain to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and ordered her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the order of the court, the Board agreed that the amount of the civil penalty would be determined by the court at a later date.  Shain also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years.  Additionally, the order prohibits Shain from associating with any person who has suffered a serious injury with any cause of a permanent or total disability, and prohibits her from participating in any offering of any kind of compensation other than for her own benefit.  Finally, the Court ruled that the Board's decision to suspend Shain violated the right of reapply provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 10 of the Exchange Act, Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  It also imposed a five-pronged standard for determining whether a person with a disability should be retired from practicing or practicing medicine.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 11, 2019).  The Court also issued an order suspending Shain and ordering her to submit a written opinion in a parallel action.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David A.
