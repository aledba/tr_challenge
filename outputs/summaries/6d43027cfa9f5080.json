  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio on April 17, 2019 entered a final judgment against Melissa Cohan, a mother of two who was not employed at the time of her husband\u2019s death, ordering her to pay $1,382.00 in overpayments in the amount of $24,204.00.  The court found that Cohan violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Cohan has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains her benefits and requires her to repay the overpayment in a timely fashion.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Cohan consented to a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, and ordering Cohan to pay a civil penalty of $13,193.00, a penalty equal to her disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $15,202.00 and $11,011.00 for the year Cohan was entitled to benefits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the southern district of Ohio today announced criminal charges against Cohan.  According to the complaint filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, on January 24, 2006, the Social Security Administration (SSA) issued an award notice to Cohan informing her that it would cease her benefits payments until it had recovered her overpayment incurred prior to July 2008, when Cohan would be entitled to a waiver of that overpayment recovery.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that the SSA failed to inform Cohan of her obligations to pay for her education and that she was not required to do so.  As a result of this conduct Cohan is without fault for the overpayment incurred after July 2008.   The complaint also alleges that, in a parallel administrative proceeding, the SEC improperly withheld benefits from Cohan based on her reported earnings in 2008 and 2009, when she was employed as an attorney.  Finally, the Commission improperly declined to determine whether Cohan had a right to seek a waiver from SSA's overpayment determination, and whether she had a duty to comply with that determination.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 26, 2006).  The SEC&rd;s Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people who are claiming to receive Social Security benefits by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC Investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0"
