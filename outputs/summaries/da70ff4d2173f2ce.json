  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a group of medical professionals charged with violating the Eighth Amendment.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Wexford Health Sources, LLC (Wexford), a private company that provides medical services at Stateville Correctional Center, and its medical director, Saleh Obaisi, violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose that Wilson had developed a severe hernia and was in serious pain.  According to the complaint, Wilson told medical personnel that he first noticed the hernia in 2011, and around that time he saw Dr. Wilson for the first time.  Wilson also alleges that he repeatedly and fruitlessly attempted to push the herniated tissue back into his abdominal cavity.  He also allegedly refused to hear potentially relevant medical details (including the ineffectiveness of attempts to \u201creduce\u201d it) and was dismissive about Wilson\u2019s treatment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Wilson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar from serving as an officer or director of a public health institution.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Wilson.  On August 30, 2016, the court granted a motion for summary judgment in favor of Wilson, and ordered a preliminary injunction against Wilson, ordering him to comply with the court's order, and appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver.  An SEC proceeding against Wilson is pending.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 24, 2016).  The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Chicago Regional Office, under the supervision of Assistant Regional Director David A. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Office of Inspector General, and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
