  "summary": "The Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has obtained a final judgment ordering Lehman Township Supervisor J. Justin Sivick to pay $30,000 to settle charges that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Pennsylvania, alleges that, as a Township supervisor and Public Works Director, Sivistick engaged in activity for the purpose of encouraging the Township to repeal its Nepotism Policy and hire his Son.  According to the complaint, the Township Board of Supervisors approved the Township's hiring in late 2012.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office issued an order requiring the Township Attorney General to provide a copy of the Ethics Act to all Township employees in order to determine whether they had violated Section 1103(a) or 1105(b)(5) when they recommended that the Township hire his son.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order, the township attorney has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078,098, plus prejudgment interest of $3,072, and orders him pay a civil penalty of $'87,949.36.  On February 1, 2019, the Court granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order, which requires the Township attorney to provide an accounting of the township's finances, to conduct an internal investigation, and to issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the Township.  A hearing on the matter is scheduled for May 24, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1722 (2017).  The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0report\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0the accuracy of\u00c2\u00a0of investor\u00c2\u00a0statements\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0SEC filings.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by\u00c2\u00a0using\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and\u00c2\u00a0whether they are professionals.
