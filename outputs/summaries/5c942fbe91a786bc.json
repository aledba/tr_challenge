  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware today entered a final judgment against Keith Rickabaugh, a registered representative of the Department of Social Security, denying his claims for Social Security disability insurance and supplemental security income.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, on July 12, 2010, Rickbaugh, then a licensed clinical social worker, told the SEC that he had severe impairments in his ability to cope with stress, anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia.  The complaint further alleges that Rickabough had difficulty with his work, had difficulty communicating with others, and was unable to perform any past relevant work.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he experienced frequent hallucinations, which he described as \"tangential thought processes\" and \"mild restlessness,\" and had trouble with his concentration and concentration.  He also allegedly had hallucinations that were consistent with the previous medical opinions he had received.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the SEC did not consider the evidence presented in the record to be sufficient to determine whether or not the claimant was disabled.

On August 22, 2012, the Court granted a temporary restraining order and entered a judgment ordering a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(3) and ordering a hearing on August 24, 2012. The court granted the temporary restraining injunction and entered an order ordering a permanent injunction against future violations, ordering the appointment of a hearing officer, and ordering the issuance of an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation.  A hearing officer will be appointed by the court upon motion of the SEC.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David Kalkstein, Donna Lentine, and Mitchell Schmidt of the Philadelphia Regional Office, and the case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The examination was conducted in the Office of the Chief of the Secretary of State, and supervised by"
