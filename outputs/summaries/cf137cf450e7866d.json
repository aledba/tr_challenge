  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana yesterday entered a final judgment in Miller v. State, 77 N.E.3d (Ind. 2005) that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The court also granted Miller's request for a temporary restraining order and a hearing to determine whether to proceed with a retrial.  According to the court's final judgment, on August 10, 2014, Miller was found incompetent to stand trial on a felony charge of attempted murder and ordered to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  On August 17, 2017, the trial court entered findings that Miller had acted with the requisite intent to kill, and that he had engaged in conduct with the intent to commit the crime.  Miller's second appeal, filed on January 27, 2016, charges Miller with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in Miller's first appeal, Miller consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains, and ordering Miller to pay civil penalties of $100,000, $50,000 and a $25,000 civil penalty.  In a related administrative proceeding, Miller also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, with the right to reapply as a judge upon motion for a hearing in the future.  As part of the settlement, Miller agreed to settle the SEC's charges against him by agreeing to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, and to a five-year bar from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a trial judge. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Nov. 2013).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and supervised by Amy C. McKinley of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Indiana State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
