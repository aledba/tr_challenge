  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on August 19, 2018, H.C., a 17-year-old minor defendant, was sentenced to 18 months of probation without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the complaint.  According to the complaint, the sentencing hearing was conducted by a probation officer who reviewed the complaint and found that the defendant was not entitled to a fair sentencing hearing because he had not cooperated with the trial court's investigation.

The court also found that, in the instant case, the defendant had refused to plead guilty but had instead accepted a pretrial offer to be placed on the sex offender registry, which it found to be excessive and demonstrative of inexcusable conduct.  On the other hand, as alleged in the case at trial, the trial judge had suggested that respondent should be given probation on a felony battery charge, which he had agreed to, rather than a sentence of probation.  To settle the SEC's charges, the judge had to determine whether to impose a permanent injunction, impose a conduct-based injunction, and impose a penalty equal to the amount of his sentence.  Finally, the jury deliberated for a short period of time before deciding whether to send a message to the defendant that \"I'm not going to do that. This is a trial.
