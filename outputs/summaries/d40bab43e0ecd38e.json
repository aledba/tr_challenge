  "summary": "On June 5, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina entered a final judgment against defendant Kurt Allen Corey for failing to conduct a jury instruction conference prior to submitting the issue of whether the \"position of trust or confidence\" aggravating factor existed in this case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, Corey was charged in 2013 with committing a sex offense against a child. The complaint alleges that, in 2013, the trial court found that defendant had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 15A-1231 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder.

The Court of Appeals also issued a temporary restraining order against Corey, ordering him to comply with the SEC\u2019s order to conduct jury instruction conferences before submitting the charges.  On June 6, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC request for a temporary injunction, ordering the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order, and ordering the filing of a criminal complaint against Corey pursuant to the Commission on the Status of the Criminal Justice Act of 1940. The Court also issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent jury investigation, including an examination of whether there is sufficient evidence to determine whether a defendant has a reasonable chance of participating in a criminal trial.
