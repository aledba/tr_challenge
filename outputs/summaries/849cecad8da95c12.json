  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment against Tyrell Johnson, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for endangering the welfare of children.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Jersey, alleges that Johnson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Johnson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and requires him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Johnson also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey announced criminal charges against Johnson.  On December 10, 2011, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Johnson, charging him with violating Sections 9(a)(2) and 9(b)(3) and 13(a) and 15(a), of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting the SEC's violations of Section 15(e) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b-11, and 13b12-13.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Johnson agreed to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his or her sentence.  As a result of the settlement, Johnson was also ordered to pay restitution of $1,768, and ordered to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  To settle the case, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered Johnson to return to the U.K. to reside and work as a free and simple citizen.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 24, 2012, for which the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage parents to check the background of anyone selling or offering them advice on how to spot signs of child abuse or neglect.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages parents to be wary of any solicitation of the sale of or offering of a gun, and encourages children to be cautious of any offer of the gun."
