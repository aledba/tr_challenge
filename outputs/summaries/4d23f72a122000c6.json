  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Douglas County judge who improperly appointed a special prosecutor to handle the case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Omaha, Nebraska, alleges that Michael N. and his parents, Heather and Robert N., were unlawfully placed in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) while Michael was in the Department's custody.  According to the complaint, the court issued an order requiring the defendants to appear before the court for a hearing on the merits of the case, which the court found to be reasonable and reasonable.  In addition, the judge's order requiring them to appear for the hearing was inconsistent with the court's finding that the parents were not properly served or provided with notice of the detention hearing.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On March 20, 2018, the District Court entered an order that permanently enjoined the defendants from violating these provisions, ordering them to return to their homes, and ordering the issuance of a temporary restraining order against Michael and Heather N. from violating those provisions.   The court's order also ordered the parents to present themselves to the court as well as the juvenile court to determine whether they were entitled to participate in the selection of counsel for the subsequent detention order.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-213 (2016).  The complaint also alleges that the defendants violated Section 5 of the federal securities laws by failing to show sufficient evidence to support their claims that they were properly served with due process and that the judge was improperly appointed to represent the state in this matter.  Finally, the complaint alleges that Heather andRobert violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act, Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  Heather's and Robert also are charged with violating Section 5, Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder and with aiding and abetting the defendants' violations of Section 10"
