  "summary": "On October 19, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan entered a final judgment against Kellogg Co., a Michigan-based manufacturer of ready-to-eat-cereal products, that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The court also granted the company's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Memphis, Tennessee, on September 26, 2016, Kellogg, the International Union, and Local Union 252-G, which represents employees at additional Kellogg's plants, entered into a 2015 Master Agreement and a 2015 Supplemental Agreement, which amended the terms and conditions of those agreements. The Master Agreement, however, did not apply to casual employees. Rather, according to the complaint, the arbitration provisions do not apply because the parties do not consider casual employees part of the bargaining unit. The complaint also alleges that the arbitration clause does not cover the claims in the Battle Creek Supplemental Agreement.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Kellogg failed to disclose to the court that he did not have jurisdiction or authority to issue a remedy for the cause of the strike.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC\u2019s action, the company consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating these provisions. The settlement is subject to court approval. The court granted the request for a preliminary injunction, which is pending final approval by the court. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and the Michigan Department of Commerce in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1771 (Aug. 13, 2016)."
