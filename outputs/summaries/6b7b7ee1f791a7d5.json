  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against a Georgia-based mother and father-in-law for failing to pay child support.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that, from 2009 to the time of the filing of the adoption petition in 2016, Lauren Grehofsky, a stay-at-home mother, attempted to contact her stepdaughter, C. N. P., through calls and Facebook messages to discuss the child and told her that she would be hearing from her lawyer in three years. The complaint further alleges that from 2009 through the time she filed the petition for the child\u2019s adoption in Texas, she attempted to communicate with the child but could not communicate with her because she did not have the money to send the payments. The court also improperly considered Chris\u2019 purported actions in thwarting her efforts to communicate. The SEC alleges that the trial court improperly considered the child in her care and failed to consider the child as a parent.  In its judgment, the court found that the mother lacked justifiable cause for her failure to provide for the children and that the child was in the best interests of the mother.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the mother consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The case is being handled by Scott M. McCollum, David A. Hannan, and Amy C. McKinley of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Graham Loomis and supervised by Amy M. McKinney."
