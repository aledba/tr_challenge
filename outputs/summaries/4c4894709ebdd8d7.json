  "summary": "On January 30, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The complaint also alleges that the defendants have failed to adequately disclose to the court that Latif, as an unadmitted non-resident alien, has a constitutionally protected right to travel internationally, to be treated like others, and to seek an explanation for her inclusion on the No-Fly list.  According to the SEC's order, Latif has not yet filed a complaint in the United Kingdom, and has not responded to the Commission's requests for a hearing on the matter. The Commission's order also prohibits the defendants from raising the issue of whether or not they have standing to challenge the inadmissibility determination of Latif's visa and the TSDB, and requires the defendants to submit a written response to a court order requiring them to do so.  In its order, the court also issued an order suspending the Defendants from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty of $100,000. The court's order freezes the defendants' assets and prohibits them from raising any additional funds from the Commission, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service. The order also freezes the assets of the defendants, and prohibits the destruction of documents.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating these provisions. The final judgments also order the Defendants to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and disgorge their alleged ill-effects. The Court also granted the defendants the right to request a hearing in which they will determine whether to proceed with a civil action against the Commission and whether to issue an order permanently enjoining them from future violations of the anti-terrorism provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Rule 12(b)(5) thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, and the FBI."
