  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered summary judgment against defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the Estate of Nicholas J. Kardos, Deceased, and his wife, who died in January 2016.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that, in 2016, Kardos was diagnosed with mesothelioma, a type of cancer caused by exposure to asbestos.  According to the complaint, the medical examiner's examination that led to his diagnosis, which was performed by a non-movant, showed that the patient had been exposed to asbestos while employed at Gulf Research, Inc., a now-defunct Pennsylvania-based company.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Kardos' affidavit and deposition testimony were inconsistent with his deposition testimony, and were inadmissible at trial.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Separately, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Appellees in a related administrative proceeding against another defendant in the same case.  On January 2, 2018, the Court granted a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 each.  An SEC order granting summary judgment requires defendants to provide depositions and affidavits to the court in order to show cause of action or defense.  For example, the SEC previously issued an order requiring defendants to submit affidavits in support of a motion for summary judgment, and a court order requiring them to provide evidence to support a jury trial. The court also ordered that defendants not cross-examine witnesses during trial, because they are not entitled to the same level of scrutiny as the jury.   In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Kardos arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  Among other things, the attorney general's office today announced that it had obtained an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor"
