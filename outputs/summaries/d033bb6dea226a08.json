  "summary": "On May 30, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Vermont entered a final judgment against the Town of Ludlow, Vermont, in which it agreed to pay a $25,273,100 civil penalty.  The court entered the final judgment in favor of the Town.  According to the court's order, on April 1, 2018, Ludlow filed a grand list of condominium properties that it deemed to be worth fair market value, which included the value of the units and common areas.  As alleged in the complaint, the Town's grand list included properties that had been appraised at or above fair market values, and the time-share owners in Jackson Gore Inn and Adams House claimed that the property was worth $32,179,000 and $11,885,000, respectively.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, the town agreed to the settlement, which is subject to court approval.  In its final judgment, the court found that the Town violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the Town to pay $20,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the property's assessed value. The court also ordered the town to provide a copy of the grand list to the hearing officer, which it did not do.  On May 31, the Court granted the town's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits it from issuing or selling any security or other security, including the right to reapply after five years. The Court also granted the request for an expedited hearing to determine the appropriate valuation of the properties.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2018).  The SEC's complaint charges the Town with violating Section 17-a-b and Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgment of ill-gotten gains plus interest, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar. The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 3619 of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-1 and seeks the appointment of a hearing officer to determine whether to issue an order appointing an independent auditor to evaluate the valuation of certain properties. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Vermont Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Vermont Attorney General's Office and the Vermont Department of Commerce in this matter."
