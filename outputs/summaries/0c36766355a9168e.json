  "summary": "On July 10, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in a civil injunctive action brought by a group of school-age children who are seeking to stop a nationwide measles outbreak.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Schneiderman violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The complaint also alleges Schneiderman aided and abetted Schneiderman's violations of the federal anti-fraud provisions. The court's order, which is subject to court approval, orders Schneiderman to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. Schneiderman agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The Court's order also prohibits Schneiderman from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to comply with the court's orders. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Schneiderman. The SEC is continuing its investigation into whether Schneiderman acted as an unregistered broker in this matter. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Health and Human Services. The litigation will be led by Daniel Wadley and supervised by Amy C. McKinley.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health, and the Office of Education and Inspections and Examinations."
