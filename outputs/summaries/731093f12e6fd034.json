  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Vincent S. Barriere, Jr. of Marshall, Missouri, finding him guilty of first-degree assault pursuant to Section 565.050, RSMo 2000, and second-degree criminal action under Section 571.015. The court also entered a judgment that permanently enjoins barriere from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, at the time of the April 17, 2016, shootings, Barrioere was a persistent offender who had previously assaulted Wallace with his fists and had also \"pistol-whipped\" Wallace on his eyebrow causing Wallace to require emergency hospital care.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Barri\u00e8re.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on April 24, 2017, in the United States District Court in the Eastern Division of Mississippi, Barrierer agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 567.031 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment also ordered him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, BarRIere consented to a judgment imposing permanent injunctions, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, and ordering him not to participate in the preparation and execution of his defense. The SEC also imposed a $10,000 civil penalty against Barrio\u00e8re. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, ordering Barrieree to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and imposing a $75,000 bar.  A hearing for the SEC is scheduled for May 4, 2018.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.   The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U-S Attorney's Department of the Southern Division of the District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
