  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Joel W. West, Jr., a convicted felon, for his role in a 2013 attempted armed robbery and armed violence.  The court found that West violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its order, the court also ordered West to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his prison time.  According to the court's order, West agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint.  West also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and ordered to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  On November 9, 2013, a jury found West guilty of aggravated kidnapping, armed robbery, and other felony charges. The court also found him liable for a separate felony charge of armed violence, for which he was sentenced to 10 years in prison.   The SEC's order against West, which is subject to court approval, orders him to pay $7,500 in restitution, a $1,500 civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The order also prohibits West from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, electronic, or otherwise of any kind in connection with the purchase, sale, or purchase of a security-related product.  It also prohibits him from associating with any third party, including a broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, or investment adviser.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 10-1(a)(2) (2014).  The case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois Attorney General's Office in this matter."
