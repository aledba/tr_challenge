  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a former employee of Drug Mart, Ohio-based loss prevention and business development.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dayton, Ohio, alleges that Michael Rivenbark violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from August 2012 through the end of July 2012, when he went to a meeting with the director of human resources, he allegedly told her that Drug Mart did not have reasonable accommodations for him because he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The complaint further alleges that, after he was terminated, he began using his break time to go to his car and read a two-page letter he had written over the course of a week discussing how Drug Mart handled his condition.  After a few days of deliberation, the complaint was overruled.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against RivenBark.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The judgment also prohibits him from participating in any officer-director or director-director-level disciplinary proceeding, including in the selection of a defendant for a jury trial.  On August 9, 2012, the trial court entered a judgment ordering a temporary restraining order, ordering him to return to work on September 2, 2013, and imposing a $15,000 civil penalty against him. The court also ordered him to comply with an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver. The receiver also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney. The jury deliberated for a total of five days before the final judgment was entered on September 22, 2013.  To determine whether to proceed with the jury selection process, the SEC requested that the court consider the merits of the complaint and determine whether it is appropriate to impose a permanent injunction. The SEC also requested that a hearing be held on the matter at a later date to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to determine if there is a reasonable basis for the termination. The hearing was conducted in the office of the Ohio Secretary of State's Office and the case was supervised by John R. McCluskey, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Ms. Ring."
