  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found liable for ineffective assistance of counsel in a Rhode Island criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Providence, Rhode Island, alleges that, in March 2009, Yara Chum was convicted on felony assault and firearms charges stemming from his participation in a shooting in which three men were injured.  According to the complaint, Chum's lawyer, Samnang Tep, failed to move for a mistrial when confronted by the three men about their involvement in a conflict that followed the disputed marijuana sale.  Chum also alleges that Tep told him that he was contacted by Erin Murray and told that she needed him to take care of something; that someone had broken her windows; that he drove down to Peach Avenue with a friend, and that he ordered the men to shoot the men on the porch.  Tep allegedly replied, without admitting or denying the allegations, that he had not made an \"incurable prejudice\" statement to the jury and that the jury had not moved for a \" mistrial.\"  The complaint alleges that the Rhode Island Supreme Court improperly assessed that deficiency by replacing the reasonable probability test with an incurable prejudice standard.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Chum to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable William J. Rymas of the United States District Court in Providence granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Chum and ordered him to pay disgorgement of $1,078, which Chum agreed would be sufficient to satisfy the court's order.   The court also issued a certificate of appealability, which requires the court to determine whether a motion for a preliminary injunction or a permanent injunction is reasonable and reasonable.  Without further explanation, the order also requires the defendant to show that he understood his Miranda rights and that statements of counsel are not evidence.  For further information, see State v. Chum, No. 17-541-JJM-LDA, (R.I. 1982).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Department of Justice's Cyber Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Connecticut and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
