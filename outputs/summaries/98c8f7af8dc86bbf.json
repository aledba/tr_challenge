  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment against a former supervisor of Hope Orthopedics who allegedly engaged in a pattern of sexual harassment and other misconduct.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that, from at least 2012 through 2014, former Hope Orthopaedics supervisor Jack Roberts violated the antifraud provisions of Section 659A.030(1)(f) of the federal employment laws.  According to the complaint, Roberts agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In its judgment, the court found that the former supervisor violated the anti-harassment provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of those federal statutes, and ordered him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public university.   The settlement is subject to court approval.
