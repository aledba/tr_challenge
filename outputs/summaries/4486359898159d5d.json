  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the United Steelworkers of America (USW) in a civil action brought by the company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, alleges that, in July 2016, Akers National Roll Company, its subsidiary Akers, and its health and welfare benefit plan (collectively, the company) announced that they would no longer be able to arbitrate the retirees\u2019 claims under the company\u2019s new healthcare plan. The complaint also alleges that in 2016, when the company announced its intention to eliminate this healthcare plan for former Avonmore plant employees who had retired before March 1, 2015, it improperly closed the case administratively and improperly.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that the company violated Section 6 of the collective bargaining agreement, which provides for mandatory arbitration in the event of a dispute arising from a separate employer-employee health plan.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's action, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the District Court issued an order requiring the company to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and ordering it to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
