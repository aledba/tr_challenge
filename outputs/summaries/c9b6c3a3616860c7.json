  "summary": "On May 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in a related administrative proceeding.  The court found that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder, and ordered the agency to comply with the court\u2019s order.  In its order, the court also ordered the DEA to provide the court with a copy of the ARCOS data, which it obtained through a public records request.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, the agency consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the agency from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to provide access to the data.  According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in federal district court in West Virginia, the order imposed a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the issuance of subpoenas or other emergency relief, and requires the DEA and the agency and the district court to provide an accounting of the volume of opioid prescriptions purchased and sold in the United States and around the world.   The final judgment also prohibits the DEA from providing any additional information about the opioid epidemic to the public in the future, including the amount of opioids being sold, the number of prescriptions being prescribed, and the percentage of prescriptions that are being prescribed by a specific manufacturer or distributor.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1119 (Aug. 31, 2018).  The SEC &rsqua;s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov website to quickly and easily search for information about people selling or selling opioid drugs using the search tool. \u00c2\u00a0On May 3, 2019, the Court issued an Order requiring the DEA &rsQuo; to provide timely and accurate information about opioid prescriptions and related drug-related products and services.\u00c2\u00a0The order also requires the agency &rs.gov/public-records to provide background information about drug users and dealers in order to determine whether they are eligible to apply for a court order requiring them to disclose the data in a timely manner.  Specifically, the Order requires that the SEC and the Department of Justice comply with court orders requiring disclosure of the data, and that the court consider the merits of the case before issuing the order."
