  "summary": "On April 8, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana entered a final judgment against Dennis Thompson, Sr., a former trustee of a state-chartered school district, ordering him to pay $11,887.20 in attorney's fees and $3,900 in administrative fees to secured creditors.  According to the court's order, on September 12, 2018, Mr. Thompson filed his first proposed Chapter 13 plan, which provided that, prior to confirmation of the plan, the trustee would pay adequate protection payments to each secured creditor in the amount of 1% of the secured claim.  The court also ordered that the payment of attorney fees be in equal amounts, which is consistent with the policy of incentivizing attorneys to participate in bankruptcy proceedings.  In its order, the court found that the equal payment provision violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b)(5)(B)(iii)(I) of the Bankruptcy Code.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, Thompson consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to pay a $1,500 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1325(a)(1)(B).
