  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment in favor of a Missouri-based forensic interviewer who was charged with improperly representing himself as an expert witness in child sexual abuse cases.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, alleges that Anthony Harper, a forensic interviewer for the Children\u2019s Advocacy Center, provided false testimony to the court regarding delayed disclosures of child victims of sexual abuse. According to the complaint, Harper repeatedly told his mother and sister that he experienced both auditory and visual hallucinations and that he had experienced both of these when speaking to forensic interviewers. The complaint further alleges that Harper was unable to properly present details about his experience with delayed disclosures, because he was not trained to deal with the issues of delayed disclosures. The SEC alleges that, in addition to providing false testimony, Harper also failed to provide specific evidence of the circumstances surrounding J.J.&nbsp; that Harper had experienced hallucinations that he described as \"junk science\" created solely for use as evidence at trial. In addition, the complaint alleges that Suttles failed to consider the reliability of Harper&rsquo;s testimony when she questioned him about delayed disclosures in child-abuse cases, and failed to show the relevance of the evidence presented by the trial court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Harper. The case was handled by J.L. Gibson, Kelli Swinton, and John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Swinton.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Missouri State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
