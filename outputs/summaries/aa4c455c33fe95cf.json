  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against defendant David K. Hansing, who was convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ohio, alleges that, from approximately 12:40 a.m. on September 5, 2014, Hansing asked J.G. to stay after her shift and do a liquor tasting with him.  According to the complaint, after Hansing entered the bar, he took off her dress, put her on the bar stool, and proceeded to carry her around the room.  As alleged, after the alleged assault, JG. did not appear to be substantially impaired, but rather, had difficulty maintaining her balance.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Hansing took a few beers and put his fingers in her vagina and anus, and that, at the end of the evening, he followed her out of the bar and into the hallway, where he allegedly engaged in a long-running sexual assault with another woman.   The complaint further alleges that after the assault, when confronted by a neighbor at the Pour House who asked Hansing to have a rape kit done, he agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, however, the defendant has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, ordering him to disgorge $1,038,078, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against him from further violations of Section 17(a) of Securities Act Section 13(b)(2) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against him. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment by using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using this tool to identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, the SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Ohio Department of Banking and Securities, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Ohio State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
