  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of two felony counts of possession of contraband.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, on June 21, 2019, Judge David J. Burt of the U. S. district court for New York entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also ordered the defendant to comply with the court\u2019s order to remove a sharpened metal spike from his pocket, which caused damage to the cell door.  In its judgment, the court also found that the defendant had violated the pre-clearance provisions of the federal securities laws, which require the jury to determine whether a defendant has a reasonable doubt about the nature of a crime.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against him.  Judge Burt also issued a temporary restraining order against Mr. Tibbels, who was also convicted of a prior felony for his role in a similar conduct.  Burt has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the appointment of a receiver for his communications with the receiver.  He has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product.  On June 24, 2020, Burt pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance and was sentenced to a five-year prison term. The jury deliberated for two hours before finding Burt guilty. The court granted the jury's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered Burt to consent to a conduct-based injunction. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson, Ms. Pypka, and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Colorado Department of Criminal Justice."
