  "summary": "On May 10, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho entered final judgments in favor of two Idaho residents who were injured while working for an out-of-state freight company.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Kasey Jorgensen and Michael Hill violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Hill was injured while troubleshooting a fuel truck together with the driver of the truck and was forced to use a sledge hammer instead to remove a wheel off an axle from a tie crane. The complaint further alleges that Hill's injuries arose out of his employment relationship with the company, which was not covered by the federal laws, and that he was not adequately trained, supervised, or assigned work in the forum state.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hill.  On May 9, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Union Pacific, charging the company with violating the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and (4) of Exchange Act Rules 206(4)-8 thereunder, and charging Hill with violating Section 15(a) of The Exchange Act and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder and Section 16(b)(2)(A) thereunder of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal law, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties of $1,000,000 and $2,500, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The case was supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Idaho Department of Insurance, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
