  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that, in early 2018, the Ohio Board of Elections declined to certify two ballot initiatives submitted to the board of elections.  In its order, the court found that the Ohio ballot-initiative statutes impose a prior restraint on the ability of a person or party to express their views through an initiative.  According to the court's order, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States constitutions, Ohio has a right to participate in the initiative process with \"an independent reasoned determination\" whether it is within the scope of the state's grant of legislative authority.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Board of elections has agreed to the issuance of a temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction, which is subject to court approval.  On August 21, 2018, a federal district court in Dayton, Ohio issued an order suspending the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of the proposed ballot initiatives, and ordering the Board to issue an order permanently enjoining them from violating the federal securities laws, including the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The court also issued an emergency court order halting the issuance and purchase of the ballot initiatives.  To resolve the litigation, the SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Secretary Of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Attorney General's Office in this matter."
