  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska today entered a final judgment against Patricia L. Rude, a former trustee of Rumac, Inc., a now-defunct Alaska-based real estate investment trust. The court found that Patricia violated her fiduciary duties as a trustee by improperly valuing the assets of two of her family members as trust assets. According to the court's order, Patricia failed to prove that she was trustworthy, trustworthy, and transparent in administering the trust assets, and that she did not have intent to violate the trust by redeeming the property. Patricia also failed to show sufficient evidence to justify her decision not to remove her as trustee. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Patricia. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Anchorage, charges Patricia with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. Patricia has agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. The settlement is subject to court approval. Patricia agreed to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The judgment also prohibits Patricia from participating in any trustee-related offering of a penny stock, and prohibits her from participating as a broker-dealer in any offering of penny stock. In addition, Patricia has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the securities registration provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(5) and 13(c)(2) and ordering her to pay prejudgment interests of $28,500 in the amount of a civil penalty of $1,500. The final judgment also requires Patricia to pay interest to the trust trustees and to pay civil penalties of $100,000. The settlements are subject to Court approval. The complaint also seeks a court order requiring Patricia to comply with the court\u2019s order not to revoke her trust.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alaska Secretary of State, and the Alaska Department of Banking and Securities."
