  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Montana today entered a final judgment in favor of a Montana chiropractor who was not liable for her injury.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Jessie Howlett, an ophthalmology technician, awoke to numbness in her right hand pinky and ring fingers, and began to experience stiffness in her upper back.  According to the complaint, Morris, a registered representative of Montana Chiropractic Center, P.C., told Howlett that he had seen over 1000 patients and that he always inputs patient history and findings into patients' files through the chiropractic profession. The complaint further alleges that Morris failed to disclose to the jury that he suffered a herniated disc when treating patients, and failed to provide evidence of the cause of the injury to Howlett. The SEC also alleges that, in addition to providing expert testimony, Howlett provided evidence of Morris\u2019s habits and routine practices when treating other patients, including his use of a diagnostic tool to detect and prevent her from suffering a serious spinal injury. The court also found that Morris was liable for the injury because he did not provide evidence to support his claims.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Morris from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $1,499.80 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Morris.  On March 4, 2019, the federal district court in Montana issued a temporary restraining order halting Morris from appearing before the SEC as an expert witness in a medical malpractice case. The order also prohibits Morris from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock, and prohibits him from appearing as an attorney or practicing before the court as an independent.  A hearing on May 24, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.
