  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced today that it has obtained a final judgment against Craig Sutton, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 46 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, on June 20, 2016, Sutton was in a romantic relationship with a woman who had been assaulted by Eisenbarth. According to the complaint, he and his cousin, Ezekiel Douglas, were in the house at the time of the assault when they were confronted by Sutton and his friends. The complaint alleges that after Sutton confronted him about the assault, the three of them allegedly agreed to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment also prohibits Sutton from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of a security deposit in connection with the revocation of his supervised release, which is subject to court approval. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Sutton consented to entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and imposing a $10,000 officer-and-director bar. The court also ordered Sutton to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000. The SEC also instituted an asset freeze against all three of the defendants.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New York today announced criminal charges against Sutton.  On May 13, 2013, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Sutton, charging him with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordering him and his brother, Ezekiel, to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations. The Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Sutton and ordered him to return to his home. The case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the SEC Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Michael J. Birkenheier and supervised by Gregory A. Kasper.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Cohen, Michael L. Gibson, and John R. Rymas of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The examination was conducted in the absence of any corroborating evidence, and the case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
