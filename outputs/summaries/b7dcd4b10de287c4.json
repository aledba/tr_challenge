  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan yesterday entered a final judgment against a Jackson, Michigan officer who conducted a search of a car carrying a backpack.  The court found that the officer violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, Richard R. Burkart conducted a routine search of the car in which he observed the defendant, Larry Gerald Mead, in the passenger seat, clutching a black backpack on his lap. The complaint alleges that the search was unreasonable because the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the car and had no apparent authority to search the car. The court also found that Burkart failed to show reasonable causeableness in his search.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mead.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Mississippi entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Burkart from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains with respect to the forfeiture of the defendant\u2019s property.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Burkart consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions, ordering him to comply with the court order, and imposing a conduct-based injunction, barring him from participating in any third-party consent search of any car, and requiring him to provide a copy of the search report to the court.  Additionally, the court ordered Burkart to provide an accounting of all the items found in the vehicle, including a digital scale, 5 prescription pills, 9.8 grams of marijuana, and 4.03 grams of methamphetamine.  Burkart also agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations, including the search of his backpack, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Ostrove and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Michigan Department of Justice in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Surveillance Strategy\u00c2\u00a0to detect and detect suspicious patterns of activity, including:"
