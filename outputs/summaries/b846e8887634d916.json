  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Christopher Lee Coley, Jr., a convicted felon, for his role in the September 21, 2006, shooting death of John Adams.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Coley violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Coley also alleges that the court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial based on insufficient evidence to support his conviction.  According to the complaint, Coley and Lawson hid behind a house and waited for the court to determine whether to grant Coley's request for a temporary restraining order and a new trial.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, after Coley confronted the court about his arrest for sale of cocaine and a probation violation, he confronted Coley about his role as an accomplice in Adams's death, and Coley agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties imposed by the court on Coley.   The court also granted Coley the right to a preliminary injunction, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, other than for his own benefit, and from appearing before the SEC as an impartial arbiter in a case that is not being handled by a neutral third party.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert E. Basinger of the U. S. District court for the Northern District of Georgia entered a judgment against Coley that permanently restrains him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and orders Coley to pay $1,500,000 in restitution, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  To settle the SEC's case, the court agreed to a permanent injunction prohibiting Coley from appearing or practicing before it as an attorney, and ordered him to sign a civil injunctive relief order that requires him to comply with the court's orders, including a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in securities, and an officer-and-director bar against him from appearing, practicing, or appearing before a court as an analyst or assessor."
