  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Utah today announced criminal charges against a rancher accused of wanton destruction of livestock.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Utah, Marvin Jay Hunt, a cattle and horse breeder based in Iron County, Utah, raised cattle and horses in an area that is unfenced.  The complaint alleges that, at the time Hunt castrated the stallions, he did not want any studs to be turned loose in the area.  As alleged, the complaint further alleges that Hunt was confronted by a neighbor who claimed to own two free-range stallions that he castrated.  He allegedly told the neighbor that he was not entitled to use force in self-defense because he believed that the horses were worth more as geldings than as stallions.  In reality, according to the complaint, the neighbor was a \"pretty decent young stud to be around\" during the days when he was \"pony size\" and would \"challenge\" humans by \"[coming] around with his ears back and his teeth bared and ready to get after you.\"  In a parallel action, the Utah Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Hunt, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Kasper and Eric R. Birkenheier of the Salt Lake Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Department of Natural Resources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and Utah State Veterinarians in this matter."
