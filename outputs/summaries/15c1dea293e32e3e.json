  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut yesterday entered a final judgment against a New Haven man who was convicted of a series of felony charges, including one count of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of felonious assault, and one count each of possession of a.22-caliber pistol and a.38-caliber revolver.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered him to return to his home.  According to the court's order, filed on August 22, 2014, Luis Perez entered the family apartment at Station Court in New Haven and began to argue with his wife, Iris Figueroa, and their four children, Chrystal Perez, Shelanie Perez, K, and L. The court instructed the defendant not to leave the scene of the alleged crime and instead to remain hidden in the apartment until the arrival of the police.

On August 24, 2015, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against Perez and ordered the defendant to return home. On August 25, 2016, Perez was arrested by the New Haven Police Department for his role in a related criminal case. Perez pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to a total of twenty-five years imprisonment and a five-year supervised release. The jury deliberated for two hours before finding Perez guilty on all of the charges. The final judgment orders Perez to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws and ordered that he be restrained from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including his right to a jury trial.
