  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment against J.M. Smucker Company for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Newark, New Jersey, alleges that Smucker violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  Smucker's complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, Smucker induced PIM to file a complaint in the United States District Court in Newark with the intent of obtaining a judgment that permanently enjoins Smucker from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders Smucker to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Court also granted the Commission's motion for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Smucker.  In a parallel action, the Commission also issued an order suspending Smucker and PIM from appearing or practicing before the Commission as part of an ongoing litigation action.  On May 17, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the U.N. District Judge's Office in Newark issued an Order temporarily restraining Smucker, PIM, and other defendants from violating the registration provision of the Exchange Act, and ordering Smucker not to participate in future litigation.   The Commission's order, which was issued on May 24, 2019 and entered by the Court on June 5, 2020, finds that the Commission has the discretion to impose a preliminary injunction, impose a conduct-based injunction, and issue an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to proceed with the enforcement of the proposed injunction.  It also finds that, as alleged in the Commission Order, the First-to-File Rule requires defendants to show that they have sufficient contacts with the receiver to issue an appropriate judgment.  For example, in a complaint filed in the District of Columbia on May 18, 2019 Smucker alleges that PIM violated Section 13 of the Commission Act by failing to comply with a subpoena issued by the Commission on Intellectual Property and Rule 13a-14.  PIM has also agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and to be barred from the securities industry. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Order also provides for the appointment of a receiver for the purpose of recovering allegedly ill-gotten gains from the Commission.
