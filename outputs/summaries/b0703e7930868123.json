  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil action brought by the Williams Island Property Owners' Association.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami-Dade County, Florida, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

Finally, Cohen has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and ordering him to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in the amount of $10,000 and a $50,000 bar.
