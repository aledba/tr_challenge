  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania man for recusing himself from sentencing sex offenders.  The court entered the final judgment on June 6, 2017, that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a penalty of 6 to 17 years' imprisonment.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against Bernal, charging him with violating the antiterrorism provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Pennsylvania, Bernal was charged with rape of a child and sentenced to nine to 18 years of imprisonment, with no further penalty on the remaining convictions.  As alleged in the complaint, the trial court misgraded Bernal's conviction to a felony of the first degree, rather than a third-degree felony, and sentenced him beyond the lawful maximum.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that Judge McDaniel, without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's final judgment, improperly imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of 6 months, 9 months, and 10 days, without providing an opportunity for counsel to present an argument on the merits of the case.  Finally, the court granted the motion for recusal on the basis of evidence presented to the court by the defendant's attorney, who was not present at the resentencing hearing.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Philadelphia Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Office of the Attorney General."
