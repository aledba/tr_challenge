  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Utah today announced criminal charges against a former Air Systems, Inc. truck driver who died in an accident while commuting to work.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that, on August 15, 2015, Air Systems and its truck driver, Geneinne Ellen Davis, negligently overstated the number of hours Worker spent commuting to and from work in the truck.  According to the complaint, the truck driver was not permitted to drive the truck, but instead used the company truck to pick up materials from supply vendors or from Air Systems' office on his way to the worksites.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Air Systems paid for the truck fuel and maintenance costs on the day of the accident, and Air Systems did not impose any restrictions on Worker\u2019s use of the truck at the time of his death.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Davis consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  Davis also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Department of Insurance, the Utah Office of Insurance Regulation, and the Utah Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
