  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Victor Horowitz for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on August 22, 2015, the trial court entered a judgment against Hydra Properties, LLC (\"Hydra\") for breach of contract for failing to comply with a court order requiring it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $468,021.87.  According to the complaint, after the court issued the judgment, Hydra wrote six checks to the defendant, totaling $5220, which he purportedly cashed on the same day.  On October 13, 2016, the court ordered Hydra to respond to the SEC's order by filing a response that, in its opinion, \"did not require any evidence or credibility determinations\" to support its finding that the checks were his property.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Hydra consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount owed to him by the court.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Hydra arising from the same conduct alleged by the SEC in its complaint against him.    In its complaint, the SEC also charged Hydra with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(e) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and seeks a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, and an officer and director bar against Hydra. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to find out whether they have any conflicts of interest.\u00c2\u00a0In addition, the Commission on Investor Education has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint\u00c2\u00a0on the subject of the Commission's Complaint against Hydra, which alleges that the Commission violated Rule 5a-14, that it failed to consider the facts of the matter, and that it has failed to inform the Commission of its\u00c2\u00a0investor\u00c2\u00a0request\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0it\u00c2\u00a0find\u00c2"
