  "summary": "On February 6, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against Community Hills Condominium Association Inc., a New Jersey condominium association, against whom it has agreed to pay a $27,358.71 civil penalty.  According to the court's order, Community Hills violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b)(2) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that Community Hills failed to comply with the anti-modification provisions of the federal securities laws.  In its complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, the court held that a condominium lien is a security interest in the debtor's principal residence, and therefore subject to the \"anti-modifying\" provision of the mortgage lien.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Community has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,839.71, $2,500 per month, and a $6,500 officer and director bar.  Community has also agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d) of Securities Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13d-13 thereunder, and to pay $27.71 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  On February 13, 2019 the court granted Community Hills' request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, and ordered that it pay a civil penalty of $18,724.71.  It also ordered Community Hills to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the bankruptcy court.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1832 (D.N.J. 2017).
