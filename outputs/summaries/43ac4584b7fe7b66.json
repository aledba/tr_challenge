  "summary": "On June 30, 2016, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a final judgment in Barnes v. Maersk Line, Ltd., a U.S. citizen who was declared unfit for duty and repatriated to the U.K.  The court held that the right to maintenance and cure, which is paid for by a member of a union, was not a prerogative of the federal labor laws. Rather, the court found that, as a matter of law, a union contract should be binding on a member. The court also ruled that, under common law, the obligation to pay maintenance and unearned wages was not an inexorable command, and that the duty to pay overtime was not subject to any pre-judgmental determination by the court. As a result, the Court held that, absent a court order to impose a \"preemption\" of the collective bargaining agreement, the duty on a seafarer to pay for maintenance or cure could not be completely abrogated by the federal government. The Court also held that there was no preemption provision in the collective agreement, and neither did the court consider the need for judicial intervention to protect seamen.  In a parallel action, on June 29, 2017, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered a preliminary injunction against further violations of the court's order. The SEC's order, which was entered into by the Court in Barnes, requires the court to consider the merits of the case and determine whether it is appropriate to issue a judgment in this matter. Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Sansone has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Grossman and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The Commission on International Affairs has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in its investigation of these matters."
