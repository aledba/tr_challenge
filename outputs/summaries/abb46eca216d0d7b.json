  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a Buncombe County Sheriff's Department employee who was charged with making a false report about a possible impaired driver.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina on September 8, 2017, alleges that Deputy Reggie Ray was called into the emergency room to assist with an investigation of a possible drunk driver who was driving erratically on Interstate 40.  According to the complaint, Ray observed a red Toyota automobile with a tag number of 042-RCW, which was consistent with the description of the driver of the car.  As alleged, the tipster described the car as \"running erratically\" and \"having an effect on [defendant\u2019s] body.\"  The complaint further alleges that Ray followed the car and observed the driver attempting to flee the scene.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for North Carolina announced criminal charges against Ray for his role in this matter.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Ray consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71 plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,079.71, a civil penalty of $100,000, and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar.  Ray also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years.  On September 9, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Ray, charging him with violating Section 15A-1443 of the Exchange Act and Rule 15a-1 thereunder and with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule\u00c2\u00a017(4)-8 thereunder. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer and director bars against Ray.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2017.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation of this matter was conducted by John R. McCole of the Atlanta Regional Office, and the case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for October 13, 2018.   The case was conducted under the supervision of Andrew J. McCluskey of the Division of Criminal Investigations."
