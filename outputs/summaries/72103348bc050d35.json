  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of South Carolina today entered a final judgment against a South Carolina-based company for failing to find that James Dent was permanently and permanently disabled due to a work-related injury.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charleston, South Carolina, alleges that on May 1, 2012, Dent sustained an admitted injury to his lower back while attempting to move a manhole cover. The complaint alleges that Dent suffered severe back pain and suffered a 21% impairment to the whole person as a result of his work accident.  According to the complaint, Dent was initially treated by Dr. Paula Belmar, a physical therapist at the time of Dent's injury, but was later diagnosed with lung cancer. The SEC alleges that after Dent began treatment with Dr. Belmar and Dr. Forrest, Dent's physical therapist, she found that Dent had lost more than 50% of the use of his right leg and suffered significant impairment to his back. Dent was subsequently diagnosed with lumbar spondylosis with moderate stenosis, and had moderate to severe physical limitations.  Dent was released from the hospital on July 10, 2015.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of S.C. today announced criminal charges against Dent arising from the same conduct that led to the SEC's action against Belmar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s action, Dent consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the State Corporation Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the U. S. Postal Inspection Service (FSA)."
