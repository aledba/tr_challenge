  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Mercy Health, Inc., a Missouri-based health insurance company, for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, alleges that Mercy Health and its board of directors violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to adequately state to the court that the Plan is a church plan and that it is not subject to federal jurisdiction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, Mercy Health agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Missouri today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On October 28, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court entered a judgment ordering the defendants to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  Sanzone also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in the creation, operation, promotion, or promotion of any health insurance program.  Additionally, the court ordered Mercy Health to provide a copy of its annual report to the Commission on Health and Human Services, which is required by federal law to provide timely and accurate information about the health care needs of individuals and organizations.  Sansone agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Missouri Department of Insurance in this matter."
