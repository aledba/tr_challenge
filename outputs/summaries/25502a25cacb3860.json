  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for failing to adequately account for the adverse health effects of ozone depletion.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the SEC's advice, the agency failed to account for adverse health-related effects associated with ozone depletion when setting the primary and secondary ozone standards. The SEC alleges that EPA failed to adequately consider the impact of the ozone depletion on the public health and the environment. Specifically, the complaint alleges that in determining the primary ozone standard, EPA relied on new scientific evidence that shows that ozone depletion is a serious threat to public health, and that, when faced with the same scientific evidence, EPA revised the secondary ozone standard downward. In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Environmental Quality today announced that it has issued an order requiring the agency to consider the health and welfare of vulnerable populations. The order also requires that EPA consider the safety and effectiveness of the secondary standard, which is required by the federal law to protect the public welfare.  In its order, the court also ordered the EPA to provide a \"rational explanation\" for its decision not to adopt a secondary standard.  According to the complaint, the Court found that EPA's decision to retain the primary standard was arbitrary and capricious because it did not consider the evidence presented in CASAC's opinion. The court also ruled that, in the alternative, EPA should have used a three-year average for ozone depletion, rather than a four-year minimum.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, EPA has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders it to conduct a \"thorough\" review of the agency's policies and procedures. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17, July 17, 2018.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi against the agency for the same purpose.  On October 26, 2015, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Conte granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization. The case was supervised by Scott A. Kasper, Chief of the"
