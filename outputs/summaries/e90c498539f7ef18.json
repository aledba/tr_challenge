  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against NuDevco Partners Holdings, LLC (\"NuDevco\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of NuDevCo, for breaching a lease guaranty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, in 2003, Ponderosa Petroleum Company (Ponderosa) entered into a lease with General Electric Railcar Services Corporation (GE Railcar) for 47 railcars to carry crude oil.  According to the complaint, in 2016, when the lease was terminated, Union Tank transferred 47 of the cars to new customers, leaving 6000 unleased cars in its inventory.  As alleged, the new customers demanded that the cars be re-let to transport crude oil, and Union Tank agreed to pay $192,975.80 in freight costs, $9605 in switching costs, and $41,315.30 in storage costs.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against the company.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Insurance, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in this matter."
