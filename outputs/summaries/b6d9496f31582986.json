  "summary": "On January 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Ohio entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of child endangering and sentenced to five years in prison.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, alleges that, on April 18, 2017, the trial court terminated the defendant's parental rights and granted him permanent custody of his children, R.D. and S.D., without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  According to the complaint, the defendant failed to adequately address the issues that caused the children to be placed in the custody of CCDCFS, including that the children were under the influence of drugs and had been placed in temporary custody of their paternal grandmother as a result of their parents' drug abuse and multiple incarcerations.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant had been previously incarcerated for drug and mental health issues and failed to provide adequate support for the children.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants were also behind in their education when they were placed in agency custody, and the children had not yet begun school.   The complaint further alleges that Father failed to comply with the requirements of Section 215 of the Indian Child Welfare Act, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he failed to appropriately supervise the children when placed with either parent.  Finally, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 206 of the Exchange Act, and Rule 206 is inapplicable to the SEC to the parties involved in the case.  On January 20, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action against Father, charging him with violating Section 215, and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years. The SEC also charged the defendant with violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) and 17(b)(3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investigational\u00c2\u00a0assessment tool\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0can\u00c2\u00c2\u00a0find\u00c2\u00a0convincing investors to invest\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0institutional\u00c2\u00a0adoption\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0success\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2"
