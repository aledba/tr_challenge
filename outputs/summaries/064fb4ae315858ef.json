  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former child abuse investigator for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that Christopher Steiner violated Section 5 of the Child Abuse Registry, which provides for the establishment and maintenance of a central registry of child abuse victims.  According to the complaint, Steiner raised the issue of whether or not to include his name in the registry because he did not show sufficient evidence to show that he had committed a serious or serious violation of the federal law.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Steiner failed to demonstrate a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest when he was included in the child abuse registry.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's opinion, the Commission concluded that the child-abuse registry is not criminal in nature and that it is reasonable to consider whether a reasonable person would be entitled to the same rights afforded to a criminal defendant in a civil proceeding.   The Commission also found that, based on the Commission\u2019s findings, Steiners was not entitled to a fair and reasonable hearing under the federal laws, and that the Commission failed to determine whether he had violated the pre-judgment provisions of the Commission Act.  It also ruled that, in a parallel action, the Division of Family and Children Services (DFCS) had failed to prove that it had acted as a neutral arbiter in its determination of whether a child abuser had committed an egregious or serious felony violation.  Finally, the Court found that DFCS failed to consider the reasonable and reasonable basis for its decision to impose a civil penalty.  As set forth in the Complaint, Section 10 of the Exchange Act requires that a person with a criminal record be included in a registry, and requires that he or she prove that he has any reasonable basis to show a reasonable cause to justify the registration.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (1962).  The Complaint also alleges that, contrary to the Commission finding that the registry violated the First and Second Amendments of the United States Constitution, Section 5(a) and (c) thereunder, Section 13(b)(2) of The Securities and Exchange Commission requires that an individual be required to show reasonable cause and reasonable reason to justify his or her inclusion in a federal registry, including that the individual has a reasonable history of abuse, that the complaint has been filed with the Commission, that there has been no history of such an action, that a defendant has been convicted of a serious felony, or that there have been any reasonable"
