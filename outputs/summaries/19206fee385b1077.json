  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found liable for domestic violence and ordered to pay a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Anchorage, Alaska, alleges that the court improperly relied on the testimony of an independent custody investigator and a custody investigator, who both agreed that the defendant had overcome the statutory presumption against granting custody to a parent with a history of domestic violence.  According to the complaint, the court found that the father was not fit for a batterers' intervention program because he was unfaithful and that he had an \"instant pattern of intimate partner violence.\"  The court also found that, contrary to the court's recommendation, the father had engaged in a pattern of aggressive, controlling, aggressive, and domineering behavior that made it difficult for the court to determine whether the defendant was fit for the program.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Alaska today announced criminal charges against the father.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in Anchorage issued a temporary restraining order against Everett, ordering him to surrender his right to a court-appointed receiver, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against him.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay civil penalties in the amount of $25,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 penalty for a second time.  To settle the case, the defendants agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgements of $1,038,078, and ordering the release of a civil injunctive relief order against each of them.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alaska Department of Children and Family Services, and the Alaska State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
