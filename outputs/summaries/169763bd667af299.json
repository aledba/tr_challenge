The SEC's complaint alleges that Craig Howard and his company, C&R Management, LLC, managed the trailer park for Mr. May, who died in December 2010.  According to the complaint, Appellant was the sole owner and sole control person of the Trailer Park, and she was the only person to have a justiciable interest in the property.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas on August 22, 2011, the Court found that Howard and the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that C&Rs violated Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder.

On August 24, 2012, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals entered a judgment against Howard, ordering him to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of The Securities Act, and ordering Howard to comply with the court's order barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the proposed settlement of the complaint.
