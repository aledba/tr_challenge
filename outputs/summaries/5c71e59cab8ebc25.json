  "summary": "On June 7, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of South Carolina entered a final judgment against Shane Adam Burdette, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to twenty-five years and five years in prison for the lesser-included offense of voluntary manslaughter.  The court also entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charleston, South Carolina, on June 6, 2016, Burdette was indicted and sentenced to prison for voluntary manslaughter and possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a violent crime. The jury deliberated for about one hour before the trial court instructed the jury that the defendant may infer the existence of malice when the defendant did not use the deadly weapon, and that the jury could not infer the element of malice from the defendant's actions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for South Carolina today announced criminal charges against Burdeta.  On June 8, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a penalty equal to the amount of the civil penalty.  Burdett agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, which is subject to court approval. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Scott L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Mr. Antkowiak. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
