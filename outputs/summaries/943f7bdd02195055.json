The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that the Commissioner improperly disregarded evidence that Ms. Keiper had severe impairments, including severe depression, anxiety, and ADD, and failed to consider the fact that she was not disabled at the time of her carpal tunnel operation.
