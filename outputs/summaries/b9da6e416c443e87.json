  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in Knight v. State, 267 So. 3d (Fla. 1st DCA 2018) that permanently enjoins him from violating the jury pardon doctrine and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his life imprisonment.  The court also ordered Knight to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  According to the court's order, Knight, who lives with his wife and two young adult children for a short time, used a heavy, metal hydraulic jack handle to beat the victim very severely in her face and head, breaking the arm she used to try to block the attack, and breaking one of her eye sockets. The court found that the defendant had no intent to kill the victim, and the jury instruction on the lesser included offense of attempted voluntary manslaughter with a weapon had been declared erroneous and replaced with a valid instruction before this trial.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Court's judgment, Knight consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to disgorge illusory gains with prejudgment interests, pay civil penalties, and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Knight, barring him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and from participating in any jury selection process.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the SEC's Miami Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson, Mr. Graham, and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Department of State Office of Criminal Justice, the Florida Office of the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General, Criminal Justice Inspections and Examinations, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central Districts of Florida, the Alabama Department of Banking and Securities, the Miami Police Department Criminal Investigation Division, the FBI, the State Department of Health and Human Services Criminal Justice Department, the Criminal Justice Division of Florida and the Florida Attorney General's Office in this matter."
