  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment in favor of a class action brought by Eufronio Jollado Baduria and Daniel Llagas, who are citizens of the Republic of the Philippines, who were employed as seamen on board the Sealift, Inc. (Sealift) vessels from July 11, 2006 through the filing of the complaint.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, defendants engaged in a variety of employment violations, including hiring plaintiffs in excess of the sixty (60) day cap for foreign \u201criding gang members\u201d and employing plaintiffs as \"seafarers\u201d without a merchant mariner document.  The complaint alleges that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1404(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14b-5 thereunder, and failing to pay the highest rate of pay under the Exchange Act.  In addition, defendants allegedly violated the anti-fraud provision of the First-Filed Rule.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Additionally, defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, to be barred from serving as officers or directors of a public company, and to be ordered to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.  Separately, the SEC filed an emergency action in which it obtained a temporary restraining order halting the issuance of the emergency court order.  On January 28, 2020, the Honorable Sandra J. Feuerstein appointed a receiver to facilitate the transfer of the litigation. The receiver is scheduled to be appointed by the court at a later date.
