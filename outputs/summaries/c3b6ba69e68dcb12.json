  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California today entered a final judgment against Facebook, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:FB) former CEO, Mark Dolin, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Mateo County, California, Dolin created thousands of unique \"Pages\" on Facebook on April 12, 2015, which he incorporated into his development of a larger shopping platform.  The complaint alleges that Dolin never objected to the forum-selection clause, nor did he have any reasonable expectation that it would be enforceable.  Dolin also allegedly failed to show that the forum selection clause was in violation of the Exchange Act.  In a parallel action, on January 29, 2018, the United States District Court in San Francisco entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Dolin from violating Exchange Act Sections 13(a)(1) and 13(b)(2) and 14(c) and orders him to pay disgorgement of $2,097.04, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14, and ordering Dolin to comply with Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 12a-1, 12b2-3, and 14c-3 thereunder, and requiring him to submit to a court-ordered injunction. The judgment also orders Dolin and his company, Adema Tech., Inc., to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.
