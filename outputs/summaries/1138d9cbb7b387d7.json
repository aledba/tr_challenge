  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Utah today entered a temporary restraining order against a Utah-based adult who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that, in 2008, a juvenile court found that children were abused and neglected and removed them from Mother's custody. The court also found that Grandmother was an appropriate permanent guardian for Children. The complaint alleges that the court improperly denied her post-judgment motion for a new trial and for a permanent placement with Grandmother.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Grandmother for her role in the alleged scheme.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on July 19, 2016, the court granted the court's request for a temporary injunction and ordered Grandmother to provide meals, maintain safe and legal housing for the children, and undertake parent training. The judge's determination, however, did not apply to Grandmother's permanent placement. Instead, the complaint alleges, the judge improperly denied Mother's request to be placed with a relative or a friend, and the court issued a permanent injunction against her from violating the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins her from future violations of the securities laws, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The final judgment also prohibits the defendant from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering to sell or offer to sell any penny stock at any time. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On August 2, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendant, charging her with violations of Section 78A-6-307, and with aiding and abetting the defendant's violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a conduct-based injunction. The SEC is continuing its investigation, which is continuing to conduct an examination of the underlying causes of the alleged violations. The litigation will be led by Ms. Hardin and Mr. Fischer and supervised by C.J."
