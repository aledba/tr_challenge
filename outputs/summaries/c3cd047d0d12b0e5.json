  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a California attorney who has been charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 425 of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 2008, Jean E. Sprengel, a licensed anesthesiologist, and her law firm, Purposeful Press, LLC (Purposeful Press), agreed to settle charges that she had breached her duty of loyalty by taking legal positions in a prior litigation that were intended to benefit the company's previous manager, who controlled the company.  According to the complaint, the defendants also allegedly engaged in and concealed a conflict of interest by failing to adequately represent their clients in the litigation.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges.  On May 24, 2013, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Last week, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, as well as an order appointing a receiver for the receiver.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  Separately, on May 26, 2018, the Honorable Kathleen A. Burns of the United States District Court in the Southern Division of New Jersey entered a judgment ordering the SEC to conduct a parallel criminal investigation.  Among other things, the Court found that the SEC had violated the duty to protect the interests of the defendants, including the duty of fiduciary duty of serving as an attorney in connection with a public matter, and that the court was entitled to a judgment imposing civil penalties against the defendant based on his breach of duty to serve as a lawyer in the same and different litigation actions.   The court also ordered the SEC and the receiver to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver, which will be reviewed by the court upon motion by the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0"
