  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of requiring school districts to conduct suspicionless drug testing of their substitute teachers.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Palm Beach County, Florida, the Florida Department of Education (D.A.D.E.L.O.) issued an order requiring school district employees to submit to a drug test before they could be hired as teachers. The SEC alleges that, in reality, most substitute teachers are not trained to deal with drug-related issues and are not required to take the drug test. In addition, as the complaint alleges, many substitute teachers have diminished expectations of privacy because of their involvement in school drug-testing.  The SEC further alleges that some substitute teachers may not be trained to spot signs of drug use.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against two substitute teachers for their roles in connection with the D.A.'s drug-test program.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Florida Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order, ordering the District of Columbia to conduct a conduct-based drug test, and ordering the Department of Justice to conduct an independent examination of the conduct of its employees. The investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry and Eric R. Werner of the Division of Education's Office of Inspector General.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Florida Office of Education in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (March 22, 2018)."
