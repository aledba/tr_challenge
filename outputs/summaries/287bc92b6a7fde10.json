  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a former member of the Missouri State Highway Patrol for his role in the May 2014 drowning of Brandon Ellingson.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that MSHP Sergeant Randy Henry violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Henry also raised the possibility of internal MSHP corruption during the investigation of the drowning by insinuating the special prosecutor in the case may have been involved in a quid pro quo with MSHP to exonerate her son in a rape investigation.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Henry repeatedly discussed serious and unverified allegations of corruption within MSHP, was less than candid with the prosecutor and her son, and disseminated unverified claims of corruption in the prosecutor's office.  Henry also allegedly used social media to spread unsubstantiated information about the internal investigation and to the family.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Henry has failed to show that he engaged in a legitimate, nondiscriminatory conduct in connection with his participation in the alleged misconduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Henry consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties he will pay, and a penny stock bar against him.  Finally, the judgment orders Henry to attend a mandatory counseling evaluation under the supervision of Appellee Schoeneberg, which will determine whether the agency's interest in efficiency and inefficiency is warranted.   The court also ordered Henry to pay $1,500 in restitution, a $100,000 civil penalty, and an $80,000 officer-and-director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Hahn and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri Department of Justice, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
