  "summary": "On March 22, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a Texas man who was convicted of selling a controlled substance in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas, alleges that defendant Anthony \"Chilly Willy\" Carter, a forensic chemist who conducted controlled substance and blood alcohol analysis, sold, among other things, an item called \u201cRipped,\u201d which contained the compound fluoro-ADB.  According to the complaint, Carter was told of the illegal nature of the substances, including that the substance he sold was a \"fluoro-adb\" that was manufactured by naturally occurring or cooked up by a human being.\u201d  The complaint further alleges that Carter was not qualified to sell the substance because he had virtually no formal education, on-the-job training, or training in the drug trade.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he continued to sell, despite the fact that he did not know which substance he was selling, the amount of the substance in question was unknown, and the manner in which the substance was being tested differed little from the analysis of non-synthetic controlled substances.  As a result, the jury was unable to determine, beyond reasonable doubt, whether Carter knowingly sold the substance.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Carter consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Carter also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay disgorgement of $5,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $100,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of anyone selling, offering\u00c2\u00a0an investment in\u00c2\u00a0the investment by\u00c2\u00a0using the\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and\u00c2\u00a0find\u00c2\u00a0proof of compliance.\u00c2\u00a0In this case, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar."
