  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio on October 1, 2018, entered a final judgment against Terry L. Bennington, who was convicted of burglary in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also ordered Bennington to pay $1,667 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  According to the court's order, filed in August 2018, Bennington was convicted on all four counts of burglary and sentenced to a total of five years in prison.  In a parallel criminal case, the court previously found that Bennington had committed second- and third-degree felony burglary.  On October 2, 2017, a jury found Bennington guilty of one count of second-degree burglary and two counts of felonious assault.  Bennington pleaded guilty on all three counts of the same felony and was sentenced to five years and three months in prison, with the amount of his prison time to be determined by the court at a later date.  After a two-day trial, the jury found him guilty of all four of the charges and ordered him to pay five years, three months of probation, and one day of officer-and-director and conduct-based injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Benjaminnington consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, imposes a $10,000 civil penalty, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the United States.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $2,500 civil penalty and a $500,000 bar.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Mascianica and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio State Attorney General's Office, and the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation."
