  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Gregory Emmanuel Williams, Jr., a convicted felon who pled guilty to three separate felony property crimes, and sentenced him to prison instead of probation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Williams violated his rights against double jeopardy and abused its discretion by sentencing him to a sentence that was improperly enhanced from a class A felony to a felony.  According to the complaint, Williams was on probation for the 2014 vehicular burglary, which had been entered as a third-degree felony, when the district court initially imposed a zero-to-five-year prison term and sentenced Williams to probation instead of prison.  As alleged, Williams had no reasonable expectation of finality in the sentence he was sentenced to, and the court did not consider all of the legally relevant factors necessary for a sentence to be effective.

Additionally, Williams agreed to be permanently enjoined from associating with any third- or fourth-tier criminal organization, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  He also agreed to a one-year officer-director bar and to a three-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in any type of substance-abuse treatment program.  Finally, the court agreed to send Williams to prison on a one year-and-one-day basis.  It also ordered Williams to participate in an inpatient treatment program for opioid addiction, which is subject to court approval.
