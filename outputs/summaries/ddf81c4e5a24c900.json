  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of four counts of gratification of lust, two counts of sexual battery, and one count of statutory rape.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Attala County, Mississippi, on Nov. 20, 2018, a jury convicted Sidney B. Bishop of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Bishop, who was a member of the Bishops' family, lured Brenda over to his house under the guise of playing with his cats.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the evidence presented to the jury was insufficient for the defendant to prove that he had ever been molested by his stepfather, and Bishop was irreparably prejudiced by an improper limitation of his cross-examination of Brenda's mother; (3) whether the trial court erred by excluding evidence that Brenda had been in the presence of another man suspected of abuse; and (4) whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request an alibi instruction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Bishop.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint against Bishop alleges that he was improperly limited in his ability to cross-examine his mother about a pending fraud charge and a non-adjudicated embezzlement charge, and that he failed to provide reasonable, fair-minded jurors with sufficient evidence to determine whether the jury found him guilty of those charges.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Bishop has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $75,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval."
