  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a Clarington, Ohio couple for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal divorce decree.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Randa Milosavljevic, who was previously ordered not to transfer or encumber marital property in violation of the divorce decree, failed to disclose to the wife that she was entitled to a share of the profits generated from oil and gas lease payments.  According to the complaint, the wife failed to inform her husband that the lease was being held in suspense until the end of the primary term of the lease.  In fact, the complaint alleges, the husband did not tell the wife about the lease until after the final divorce decree was issued, and he did not inform her that he was holding the lease in suspense.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed in federal court in Dayton, Ohio, the court found the wife liable for the loss of the property and ordered her to pay a civil penalty of $191,292.96.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint to the court, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $281,185 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $192,965. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On June 22, 2018, a federal district court in Ohio granted the wife's motion for a temporary restraining order against the husband and ordered him to comply with the court's order to hold a hearing on her motion for relief. The court granted the husband's request for a permanent injunction, ordered the wife to relinquish the truck, and ordered the husband to deposit $2,657.40 with the clerk of court for a total of $3,188.96, which is equal to the amount of royalties paid to the husband in the divorce proceeding. The wife also agreed to a civil injunction prohibiting her from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, or sale of any oil-and-gas lease for a period of five years after the divorce judgment was entered. The divorce proceeding was conducted in the absence of any evidence concerning the alleged misconduct and concealment of assets by the wife. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Mrs. Milos. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
