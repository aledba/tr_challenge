  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) against six individuals charged with violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, from at least December 2017 through February 2018, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") issued a temporary restraining order preventing the release of unaccompanied minors from Central American countries.  According to the complaint, the DHS violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(3) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the Court also issued an order freezing the assets of the defendants and imposing a civil injunctive relief order against the defendants.  On March 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal laws, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Separately, the court granted the defendants' request for an injunction against future violations of Section 15(a) and (c) of Exchange Act Rule 10a-5 and Rule 15a-11 thereunder.  Without further explanation, the order also prohibits the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security or other security-related documents, including the right to a court order prohibiting the destruction of any evidence or evidence, and prohibits the destruction or destruction of documents.  For further information, see Litigation Release Order No. 13-20-2019 (January 2018).  The court also granted the parties' motion for an expedited hearing on March 26, 2019.
