  "summary": "On March 22, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of South Dakota entered a final judgment against the Commission on Gaming against Mark Haddad, a South Dakota resident charged with defrauding investors in a casino.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that, on September 19, 2016, the Commission found that, at the beginning of the casino's investigation, Johnson took $20 in chips from a patron and placed them in the tip box.  As alleged in the complaint, Johnson did not attempt to identify the individual who had left the chips at the table.  Instead, Johnson allegedly placed the chips in a tip box and then placed them there.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, after the initial investigation and hearing, Johnson admitted to the Commission that he misappropriated the chips, and that he did not know who left them.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Johnson failed to report an irregularity to his immediate supervisor.  Johnson also allegedly failed to tell his supervisor that the chips belonged to him.  Finally, the SEC found that Johnson acted dishonestly or fraudulently in placing the chips there, despite having been told by his employer that he had not done so.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s case, Johnson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $20,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, Johnson agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about the settlement, see Litigation Release No. 17-20-2016 (January 5, 2017).  The Commission's investigation was conducted in the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations with the assistance of the Division of Gaming Enforcement, which includes the Enforcement Division's Retail Strategy Task Force. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's litigation will be led by Eric Werner and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, and the FBI."
