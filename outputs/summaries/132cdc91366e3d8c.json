  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment against John Jacob Bernal, Jr., a Meridian, Idaho man who was convicted of felony assault-by-attempt and sentenced to 15 years in prison.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Idaho, alleges that Bernal violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to her previous statements to the police, Bernal did not commit misconduct in the preparation or presentation of his defense. Instead, the complaint alleges that he engaged in a pattern of reckless driving that surprised and embarrassed Bernal.  According to the complaint, when Bernal was confronted by his brother, Gustavo Becerra, who was on the phone with his family, he replied, \"I'm gonna catch you sleeping, I'm gonna F you up.\"  The complaint further alleges that after Bernal left the scene, he followed Carmen to her home where she was on a phone with her brother, who also lives with her.  After the two men spoke, they continued to drive through the neighborhood until they were stopped by road construction.  Bernal allegedly continued to make threatening statements to his brother and to his family members, who were also in the car.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Bernal arising from the same conduct that led to his conviction.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  He also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of the company, prohibits him from associating with any third party, and requires him to show cause and effect, including a copy of the complaint filed in the federal district court for the Central District of California, that he has a right to due process and that he is entitled to a penny-per-share of any amount of money.  Finally, the court found that the defendant committed misconduct by telling the jury that he \"did unlawfully and with apparent ability, attempt to commit a violent injury upon the person of Gustavo, with a knife and/or by a means likely to produce great bodily harm, to-wit: by attempting to stab Gustavo"
