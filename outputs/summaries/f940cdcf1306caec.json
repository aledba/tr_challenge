  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against a Utah man who was convicted of self-defense in a 2017 case.  According to the SEC's complaint, Robert Lynn Sorbonne was arrested on June 20, 2018, as a result of his mother leaving him and requesting a divorce the previous night. The complaint alleges that the father followed his orders to hold the children at gunpoint and threatened to kill them if they did not comply with the court's order.  The complaint further alleges that, after learning of the father\u2019s prior violent and abusive acts, he confronted the father and confronted him, telling him that he had a history of violence and that he was going to kill him if he did not surrender his gun.  In a parallel action, the Utah Court of Appeals today issued an order finding that the court violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder. The court also found that the complaint was not admissible under the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and that the defendant was not entitled to a permanent injunction against the father from future violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Attorney General's Office and the Utah Department of Justice in this matter."
