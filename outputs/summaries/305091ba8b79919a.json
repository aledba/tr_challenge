  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma yesterday entered a summary judgment against a residential landlord who allegedly failed to repair a hot water heater.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, alleges that, on October 20, 2011, Shalalah Saunders (Tenant) discovered that she had no running hot water in her home due to a problem with the boiler.  According to the complaint, Tenant confronted Landlord with the issue and confronted her with the reality that she owed no duty of care to Tenant to maintain the boiler and to provide hot water to her family.  Tenant allegedly told Landlord that she would see what she could do to prevent the boiler from overheating and carrying it to the bathtub to have a warm bath.  She also alleged that Landlord failed to adequately repair the boiler, which she claimed caused her injuries.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Landlord.  Last week, a federal district court in New York granted summary judgment in favor of Landlord on a civil injunctive action arising from the same conduct alleged by Tenant in her complaint against her landlord.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Landlord consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David Grace, David Hays-Kuehn, and John Rymas of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the Office of Advocacy and Advocacy.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Grace and Mr. Hays and Ms. Kuehn. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oklahoma Department of Insurance, and the Oklahoma State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
