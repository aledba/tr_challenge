  "summary": "On February 27, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a mortgage foreclosure action.  According to the SEC's complaint, on December 1, 2006, Doreen T. Grennan executed a note promising to repay a loan from CTX Mortgage Company, LLC in the amount of $280,000 secured by her home in Bay Shore, N.Y.  The complaint alleges that, on the date of the foreclosure action, the defendant executed the note by first-class mail, without a copy of the note, and without a receipt of the required signature.  As alleged in the complaint, Panganiban failed to establish that the note was signed by someone with personal knowledge of the matter, and failed to show that the signature was stamped on the note.  In a parallel action, on February 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Robert F. Quinlan of the New York Court of Appeals granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On March 8, 2013, the court entered a judgment against the defendants that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $150,000 each, and ordering them to appoint a referee to calculate amounts due to the borrower and the servicer. The court also ordered that the defendants submit copies of the complaint to the court, and that the court appoint a receiver to determine whether the borrower is entitled to a hearing or to a judgment of foreclosure and sale. The defendants also agreed to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-registered broker-dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-11-2019.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil action in the United States District Court in Manhattan on February 26, 2018 against the four defendants in the same action. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas and Carol MacKenzie, and the litigation is being led by Jennifer A. Basinger."
