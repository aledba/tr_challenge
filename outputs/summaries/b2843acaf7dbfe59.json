  "summary": "The Honorable Alan Z. Thornburg of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against a defendant who was indicted on two counts of attempted murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that on 27 November 2017, defendant Y.B.G., who was a minor at the time of the alleged incident, took indecent liberties with a minor during a second trial.  According to the complaint, M.G. and her two children, who were present and available to testify, were not present when the trial court declared a mistrial on the defendants\u2019 motion.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant failed to show sufficient evidence to show that he was entitled by reason of former jeopardy to the right to be free from double jeopardy, which is required by the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15A-1063 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from appearing before the SEC as an attorney or practicing as a public figure.  On May 23, 2018, the court issued an order granting a motion to dismiss based on the fact that a jury had been impaneled the previous night and there was no response from the jury. The next morning, on 23 May 2018, Judge Gavenus denied the request to dismiss on the basis of a finding that the jury had not been properly trained on double jeopardy and that the evidence presented to the court was insufficient for the jury to determine whether to grant a fair and impartial trial. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any such order. The complaint also seeks a court order requiring the defendant to show cause why he or she should not be held in contempt of court and set a hearing for 9:30 a.m. the following morning for a hearing on the matter.  A hearing on May 24, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m., but Judge Thornburg denied the SEC request to hold the hearing until the jury was informed of the evidence. The hearing was delayed until 12:30 that afternoon, when the defendant again refused to cooperate and the jury"
