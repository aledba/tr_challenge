  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in favor of the Ohio Department of Transportation (DOOT) and Cosmos Industrial Services, Inc. (Cosmos) in a civil action brought by Fidelity and the IRS.  According to the SEC's complaint, from 2012 to 2015, Cosmos, a contractor, entered into construction contracts with ODOT for various state roadway projects. The contracts required ODOT to make monthly progress payments to Cosmos based on the amount of work completed, after the contractor submitted applications for payment to the government. The complaint alleges that, as a surety, Cosmos had no property or rights to property under the contracts and was entitled to receive the funds as a performing surety under the federal tax lien laws. The SEC alleges that when ODOT declared Cosmos in default on April 6, 2016, it formally assigned the two projects to Fidelity in an amount sufficient to pay the liens.  The complaint further alleges that Fidelity failed to pay its obligations in the future progress payments because the IRS's liens had attached to Cosmos\u2019s interests, and Fidelity did not take over the projects until after the IRS had paid those obligations to the contractor.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Fidelity consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $589,049.49 plus prejudgment interest of $1,336,105.82 for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 589, 591, and 1384 (2014).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert on Investor.gov to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Retail Strategy Task Force has also issued an investor alert on investor.gov, warning investors to be aware of the potential for fraud when making investments in a company that does not pay taxes.  Investors can also check the background of anyone selling investments with the SEC by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify any red flags of potential fraud.  In addition, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Ohio Attorney General's Office."
