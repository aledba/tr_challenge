  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against Morgan Verkamp LLC, a Texas-based law firm, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Pennsylvania, alleges that, in 2008, Morgan and her husband, Frederick Verkamp, worked together at an Ohio law firm. The complaint alleged that Morgan and Verkamp filed a civil injunctive action in Pennsylvania state court against Michael Epp, who was living outside the United States, for fraud, conversion, breach of contract, and tortious interference with both contractual and prospective contractual relations.  According to the complaint, the complaint further alleges that the defendants exchanged emails and spoke on the phone while working in Ohio and Texas, and that Morgan & Verkamp collected several million dollars in attorney\u2019s fees from Epp. Rather than file a complaint, Danziger filed a writ of summons and sought discovery.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania court agreed to send the case to federal court. The court also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The final judgment also orders Morgan andVerkamp to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 each.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The court will determine whether to impose a permanent injunction, impose a conduct-based injunction, and determine the appropriate amount of money to be distributed among the parties.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 1351. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court against Epp in Pennsylvania on June 2, 2016.  On June 13, 2018, the court entered an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent investigation into Epp's activities in Pennsylvania.  To determine whether the SEC is entitled to an independent examination, the agency has requested that the court consider whether to issue an order appointing a receiver. The SEC has also requested a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  This matter is being handled by James W. Moore and Arthur R. Miller of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
