  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Robert Leonard Denhartog, Jr. for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that, in 2012 and 2013, Denharto was convicted of first degree assault of a peace officer and second degree assault for second degree burglary. The complaint further alleges that in 2013 and 2014, when he was charged with the same felony, Denhartog allegedly drove his Jeep into a motorcycle officer and then attempted to evade arrest. According to the complaint, the officer was on his motorcycle at the time of the collision and did not see the Jeep coming toward him before the impact. The SEC alleges that the defendant immediately reversed the Jeep and hit the officer, causing the officer to fall. The court also found that, on the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the defendant did not have the intent to harm the officer. In addition, the court found that the officer had \"squarely put\" the Jeep into the officer\u2019s motorcycle, which put the officer at risk of serious bodily injury.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New Jersey today announced that it filed criminal charges against Denhartogo.  On the SEC's continuing investigation, the agency's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them advice on how to protect themselves from investment fraud.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado State Attorney General's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  For further information, see Press Release No. 559 (Colo. 1999).  The Office of Professional and Risk Analysis has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint Bulletin\u00c2\u00a0on the subject of this matter. The Office has also issued an Investor Alert on the subject, warning investors to be aware of the potential for errors in the reporting and reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, including the reporting requirements of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the books and records provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, and the Office of the Chief of the Market Abuse Unit (OBI). The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people who commit a crime by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investigational tools to identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals and to determine whether they have sufficient expertise to spot signs of misconduct."
