  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Utah today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found liable for a felony burglary and for failing to adequately investigate additional alibi witnesses.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Carrick violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Carrick was the only person in the home at the time of the burglary when he entered the home through a window and entered through a garage door.  Carrick also allegedly told one of the neighbors that he knew the code to the garage door and that he would not need to go through the door if he wanted to enter the home.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Carrick.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000.   The judgment also prohibits Carrick from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a security deposit or offering of any security deposit, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by R. Collin Mangrum and Dee Benson of the Salt Lake Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Utah State Corporation Commission in this matter."
