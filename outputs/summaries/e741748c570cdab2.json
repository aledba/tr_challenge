  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a California-based physician convicted of fraud in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that California Hospice Care (CHC) fraudulently billed Medicare and Medi-Cal for hospice care given to patients who had been falsely certified as terminally ill. According to the complaint, Wijegoonaratna recruited around half of CHC's patients, participated in team meetings, and served as its associate medical director. The complaint also alleges that the CHC staff completing the intake form did not copy the patient's diagnosis, and instead paid some patients to be on hospice. The SEC alleges that this conduct was inappropriate as a more sweeping statement of the law. The court also ruled that the defendants should not be held responsible for billing that occurred after the initial 90-day hospice certification.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against one of the defendants for his role in the scheme.  On May 24, 2017, the U.N. District Judge in Manhattan granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee CHC. The case was handled by Sharon Patrow, her daughter, Erwin Castillo, a registered nurse, and a former CHC employee. The litigation will be led by Ms. Patrow and Mr. Castillo and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0To learn more about investing in a healthcare program, see Investor Alert.gov/Hospice."
