  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the California Department of Justice in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, alleges that, from 2003 through 2007, Candace Cates filed a complaint alleging that the Commission violated its statutory duties to collect money owed to the state from Indian tribes.  According to the complaint, Cates's complaint was filed in violation of Section 1021(5) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the Commission failed to timely and timely respond to her requests for an attorney fee award.  Cates also alleged that, contrary to the Commission's representations, the Commission did not perform its duty to collect and account for the tribes' substantial losses.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Cates failed to comply with its obligations to collect fees from the tribes, including by failing to provide sufficient evidence to show that the tribes were complying with their mandatory obligations under the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) and 14(a)(2)(A) of Securities Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 14a-13 thereunder.  It also orders Cates to pay $2,011,844 in attorney fees, which represents approximately $12.7 million of the tribe's $11.5 million in losses, and a 1.85 positive multiplier.  Additionally, the court granted Cates a temporary restraining order, which prohibits her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, and orders her to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of her disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon.  On May 24, 2008, the Honorable Judge David G. Oberholtzer of the federal court in San Diego entered a judgment against Cates that permanently restrains her from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(c), and 12(d), and ordered her to repay $1,229,565.35 in fees that she received as a result of her complaint, which she did not receive as a part of the compensation for her conduct in the litigation.   The court also granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, ordering the defendants to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, and ordering the Commission to pay civil penalties.
