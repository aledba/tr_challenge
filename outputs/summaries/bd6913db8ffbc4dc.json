  "summary": "On January 9, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against ZFX, Inc., a Kentucky-based \"flying effects service provider\" incorporated and organized under Nevada law.  The court found that ZFX violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the court's findings, ZFX consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of money it has already paid to settle the case.  ZFX also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  According to the court\u2019s order, the court entered a temporary restraining order on the motion to intervene, which prohibits ZFX from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer and from intervening in a settled administrative proceeding.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New York today announced criminal charges against Kirsch and Dean.   The SEC also issued an order requiring ZFX to comply with a court order requiring it to consider whether it had a reasonable basis to intervene in a pending administrative proceeding, and that it had sufficient evidence to determine whether to intervene.  On February 9, 2016, the district court granted a motion to compel arbitration of Kirsch&Dean&ZFX&Kirsch&Rutlinger&ldquo;s motion for permissive intervention, which was filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, and which was approved by the court on January 10, 2018.  As set forth in the SEC's order, this action is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 17, 2018).  The Court also denied ZFX&D&&qq&e;s request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (d) and 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b-1, and 13b2-1 thereunder, and Rules 12b-20 and 13d-3 thereunder; Rules 17a-11; Rules 13b1-1; Rules 12a-13; Rules 14b-14; Rules 16a-1-2; and Rules 16b-3;"
