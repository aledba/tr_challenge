  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of two counts of sexual assault in 1999.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, in 1999, M.D., then a child, told her mother that she had been raped by her father.  According to the complaint, the mother told her son that her son had told her that he had been molested by his father, and that the father had told his son that he was unable to understand the nature of the sexual act and unable to give knowing consent to it.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant told his mother that, when she was 7 years old, defendant entered her bedroom, removed her pants, and penetrated her vagina with his penis.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed under Section 5-8-1(a)(2) of the Criminal Code of Illinois, defendant knew that his father had committed the same act and that he would later be convicted of the same crime.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of three years, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, or in the promotion of any investment in a public company. The court also granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from associating with any third-party, including a broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, or investment adviser, and requires him to provide a copy of the complaint to the court.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans of the Chicago Regional Office issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation of the case. The receiver will determine whether to issue an order permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office in this matter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Illinois Department of Justice Criminal Division Criminal Investigation Division, the Department of Health and Human Services Criminal Justice Department Criminal Investigations Division and the Division of Justice's Office of Inspector General."
