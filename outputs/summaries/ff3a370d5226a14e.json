  "summary": "On May 4, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Vermont entered a final judgment against a Vermont-based water quality control company, ANR, for violating the antidegradation provisions of the federal Clean Water Act.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Rutland, Vermont, alleges that, in 1981, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a water quality certification for the operation of three hydroelectric dams located on the Lamoille River and its tributaries.  According to the complaint, the agency's definition of high-quality aquatic habitat was arbitrary and capricious because it did not consider the need for a specific use of the water to meet water quality standards.  In addition, the complaint alleges that ANR failed to adequately consider the impact of the current drawdown on the water quality of the reservoir.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin ANR from violating these provisions, and order the agency to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  ANR also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $2,500.  An SEC order imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against ANR is the latest in a series of administrative actions that have been instituted against the company and its affiliated entities.  On May 5, 2017, the court granted an emergency court order requiring ANR to comply with the federal water quality rules, which require agencies to maintain or improve water quality. The court also granted the company's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits it from violating the federal securities laws, and ordered the company to pay an $8,500 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000, which is equal to the civil penalty imposed by the agency.   The court's order also requires the company, its affiliated entity, and its associated entity to provide a stream-level water quality test to determine whether a particular use of water is appropriate for the designated use of that water.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17, July 17, 2017.  Separately, the SEC filed an emergency action on May 9, 2017 in the Eastern District of New York, charging ANR with violations of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, and an order requiring the company"
