  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New York City attorney who was barred by conflicts of interest from representing his wife in a pending divorce action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, on November 21, 2014, the defendant-wife consulted with multiple law firms and then briefly retained a third attorney when she was contemplating suing her husband for divorce. The complaint alleges that the attorney at issue, who was then an associate at Cohen Clair, did not retain her as a client and instead retained another attorney to represent her husband in the litigation. The SEC alleges that, contrary to the representations and practices of the law firms, Cohen Clair retained the attorney she consulted with and failed to identify the other attorney present at the time of the consultation. The court found that Cohen Clair violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the court also ordered Cohen Clair to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Kassis and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Office of the United States District Judge in Manhattan. The Court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert on Investor.gov, warning investors to be wary of any solicitation of investments in a small law firm. Investors can check the background of anyone selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also check whether they have retained an attorney who has been associated with a law firm and has taken steps to ensure their clients' confidentiality is protected.  For example, the SEC encourages investors to \"check the background\" of anyone who has retained a lawyer before they invest in a firm by using the\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool to identify whether there is any history of misconduct, whether there has been any misconduct, and whether there have been any disciplinary actions"
