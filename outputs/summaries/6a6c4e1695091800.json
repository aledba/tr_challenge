  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment in favor of Big Sandy Company, L.P., a Kentucky-based oil and gas company, and its former owner, R.J. Graf, LLC (collectively, \"EQT\").  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky on May 24, 2009, Big Sandy alleges that EQT violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by drilling wells without approval and failing to provide an accounting of the amount of the overpayments.  The complaint also alleges that Big Sandy failed to disclose to the court that it had overpaid EQT for coal left in place around a well when the well was drilled.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Big Sandy.  On May 26, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against EQT, alleging that it failed to comply with its obligations under the federal securities laws, and that it was entitled to a partial summary judgment based upon the findings of a recent court order requiring EQT to pay a civil penalty of $777,000.  EQT has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal, state, and local securities laws and requires it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $20,056.95 and $39,403.10, respectively.  Big Sandy has also agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, EQT agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal and state securities laws.   The SEC is continuing its investigation into the matter, which is continuing to be conducted by the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations, with the assistance of the Kentucky Office of Financial Regulation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kentucky Secretary of State, and the Kentucky Attorney General's Office."
