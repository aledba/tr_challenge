  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in favor of a settlement that permanently enjoins the District from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder, and orders the District Attorney's Office to conduct a parallel criminal investigation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., alleges that, under the federal securities laws, a partner is entitled to a duty of loyalty to the firm and to remit to it the fees earned from hourly-billed client matters.  According to the complaint, however, the obligation of loyalty is limited to paying for the services performed by the partner at the time the partner left the firm.  In addition, the complaint alleges that a partner who leaves the firm has no duty to account for profits earned post-departure, except that a surviving partner has yet to be paid for the work it performed and will not be paid until the matter is resolved.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 579 A.2d (D.C. 1997).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Bankruptcy Commission, the U.K. Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Office of Compliance."
