  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against Santraun Deshaud Speller, Jr., a Virginia resident convicted of two counts of grand larceny of a firearm.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that Speller violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from approximately 12:30 p.m. on February 26, 2016, Speller entered the home of a neighbor who had been burglarized the previous day. The complaint further alleges that when Speller left for work that morning, he saw three unknown men enter the home and steal a \"box full of stuff\" out of the trunk of a silver Buick. As alleged, the men then ran across the yard, jumped over a fence, and ran into Bare\u2019s home. The SEC alleges that after Speller and his accomplices entered the house, the three men left the house and ran out the back door, leaving Bare behind with the stolen items. The court also found Speller guilty of conspiracy to commit burglary of a home.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Speller.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 582-60, 562 S.E.2d 799 (1999).  The complaint also names Speller as a defendant for the purpose of recovering stolen property from the alleged perpetrators.  On February 27, 2018, the U. S. Attorney's office for the Northern District of Florida announced criminal sanctions against Spellers.  To learn more about gun laws violations, see Criminal Justice Act Section 17(a)(1) and Section 13(b)(2) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  A hearing is scheduled for May 24, 2018.   The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Alexandria Division of Criminal Investigations."
