  "summary": "On January 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington entered a final judgment against Union Pacific Railroad Company, a Washington, D.C.-based freight train company, for violating federal law on breaks and rest periods.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Spokane, Washington, alleges that Union Pacific, through its director, Gregory Neal Gonzales, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the Department's claims, Union Pacific has not violated the federal laws on breaks or rest periods, and that it has not threatened to enforce those laws. The SEC alleges that the Department of Justice has not, and has no plans to, enforce Washington's break rule, and the complaint alleges that none of these provisions are preempted by federal law. According to the complaint, Gonzales' email, which was sent to an attorney who was representing him at the time of the SEC's action, stated, \"I am fearful of losing my job because I am not being allowed a basic human right of nourishment.\"  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia today announced criminal charges against the company.  On January 27, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendant, charging him with violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and a $10,000 officer-and-director bar.  A hearing is scheduled for February 26, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17204339 (4).
