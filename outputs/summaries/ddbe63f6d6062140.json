  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Eric A. Jones, Jr., a San Francisco man charged with multiple counts of second degree burglary of a vehicle and additional offenses arising from a series of car break-ins throughout San Francisco that occurred over a 17-month period.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, Jones violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC alleges that Jones was the only defendant charged in the series of auto burglaries who had a propensity to commit and did commit the other charged crimes.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jones.  As alleged in the complaint, Jones was also charged with five counts of Second Degree Burglary, three counts of Grand Theft of Property, and one count of attempted second-degree burglary.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Jones consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar.  Jones also agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  On August 1, 2015, a jury found Jones guilty of five felony counts of first degree burglary and one felony auto burglary. The jury deliberated for less than two hours before finding him guilty of the five charged counts. The court also found that Jones had been on bail when he committed the earlier auto burglary and that he had been convicted of other charged criminal charges. The SEC also found Jones liable for five other felony counts, including one for second degree theft of property and one for grand theft of personal property.  To settle the case, the court ordered the jury to consider the relevant facts of each of the charged crimes by a preponderance of the evidence, including whether the defendant committed the charged offenses by a reasonable doubt.  A jury also was instructed to consider whether to use evidence of a prior criminal conviction to determine whether a defendant had committed a prior felony and whether he had committed another charged criminal offense.  For example, the jury was instructed not to consider evidence of the October 2013 conviction of auto burglary, the October 2014 conviction of car theft, the January 2015 conviction of home invoices, and the November 2015 auto burglary in which Jones was convicted."
