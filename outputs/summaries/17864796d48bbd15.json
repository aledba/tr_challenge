  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona today entered a temporary restraining order against Kodiak Fresh Produce, LLC and Blair A. Hillman, alleging that they violated the trust provision of Section 5(c) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of 1940.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on August 29, 2016, the Court entered a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) on KodiakFresh's behalf on December 27, 2016.  The complaint alleges that the Hillmans and Hillmans purchased the Real Property in 2009 and used the property to make lease payments to H & K/Tolleson Steel, which they then used to make mortgage payments to Hobbs, using Canyon State for processing.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the Hillman and Hillman did not purchase the real Property, and Hobbs did not sell the real property to a third party.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the court granted the motion for preliminary injunction, which is pending final approval by the court.  In a parallel action, on January 17, 2017, the United States District Court in Phoenix, Arizona entered an order temporarily restraining the defendants from violating the trust provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of $1,600,000, prejudgment interest of $192,768, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On February 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge granted the court's order temporarily halting the defendants' violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties of $150,000 each.   The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Arizona Office of Financial Regulation and supervised by Marc Blau, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Gaunt, and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Arizona Department of Banking and Securities, the Arizona Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Arizona Division of Securities and Exchange Commission (DFCA) in this matter.
