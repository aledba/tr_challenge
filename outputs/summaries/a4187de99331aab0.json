  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against a third-party beneficiary of an insurance policy that was not in effect at the time of the fire.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sandusky, Michigan, alleges that the insurance company TNT Equipment, Inc. (TNT) violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to pay claims to its insureds for damages to farm equipment that was stored at the facility at that time.  According to the complaint, as subrogees of their insureds, plaintiffs' insureds were entitled to coverage under the policy and therefore entitled to enforce the policy against them.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants were not named as a party to the policy when, in fact, they were not entitled to payment from the company.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 1405 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount owed to them by the settlement.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and is being supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Insurance's Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Insurance, and the Michigan Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
