  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Arizona announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against a California-based juvenile offender for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint alleges that A.C.E.D., a 17-year-old who was charged with a felony theft and harassment charge in April 2013, falsely claimed that he was competent to stand trial.  According to the complaint, however, the court found him incompetent to proceed because he did not provide sufficient evidence to show that he had a mental or developmental disability.  In fact, the complaint alleges, as alleged, that the defendant did not meet his burden of proof, and that the court did not abuse its discretion in finding him competent to proceed.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000.   The court also granted the defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval, to a hearing on the merits of the case, and to a preliminary finding of competency by a court of competent jurisdiction. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John R. Roper and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Arizona Department of Criminal Justice, the Arizona Office of Juvenile Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
