  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against TRAX International Corporation, a contractor for the Department of the Army, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that TRAX violated the pre-judgment provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to provide after-acquired evidence to show that an individual with a disability was qualified for the job.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that, in addition to failing to meet the prerequisites for the position, TRAX also failed to consider the fact that Anthony lacked a bachelor\u2019s degree when she was terminated.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 12111 of the Exchange Act, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order requiring TRAX to conduct an independent review of its policies and procedures in order to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify an adverse employment action.  On May 30, 2012, the court granted the SEC's request for summary judgment, which is subject to court approval, and ordered the company to comply with the court's order.  A hearing on June 1, 2013, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Compliance, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
