  "summary": "On September 21, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against the City of Hayward and its Chief of Police for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 6253 of the California Public Records Act (CPRA) and ordering the city to pay $2,939.58 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Jose, California, alleges that, on January 27, 2015, the California Legislature amended the federal securities laws to permit the City to produce over six hours of police body camera video recordings in MP4 format. The complaint alleges that City employees, including IT manager Nathaniel Roush and the department's records administrator, Adam Perez, spent approximately 170 hours preparing and redacting the videos in order to produce a copy of the recordings. According to the complaint, the City agreed to pay this amount under the terms of the CPRA, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the city. The SEC also announced that it has obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of the city and ordering an asset freeze and other emergency relief. The court's order freezes the assets and proceeds of the asset freeze. The case is being handled by the SEC's Office of Inspector General, the San Francisco Office of Public Finance, and the Market Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center. The litigation will be led by Marc Blau and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the California Secretary of State's Office."
