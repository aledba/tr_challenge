  "summary": "On April 19, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Deandre T. Baskin, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in a domestic violence case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, on January 11, 2018 and unsealed on April 13, 2019, Baskins, then a resident of Ohio, told the court that he had a prior conviction for aggravated burglary, abduction, and domestic violence that required him to be removed from the courtroom.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to the court's order, Baskain continued to act irrationally and repeatedly interrupting the proceedings.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it had obtained an emergency court order to temporarily halt the proceedings of the trial.  On April 18, 2020, the court granted the SEC the request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and ordered the defendant to return to the courtroom on May 5, 2020.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be imposed upon him at a later date upon his motion for a permanent injunction.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
