  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment in favor of Heraeus Kulzer, GmbH, Inc., a Pennsylvania-based microcap company, against Biomet Switzerland, a Swiss company that manufactures and sells microcap products.  The court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the company\u2019s assets, and ordering the company to comply with a subpoena issued pursuant to Rule 26-style discovery orders.  According to the court order, Heraeus sought discovery in the form of \"documents\" and \"copolymers\" for use in manufacturing the microcap product. The court found that Heraeus had failed to show that the German court would be receptive to its request for discovery, and that the request was unreasonable.  In its judgment, the court held that Biomet violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1782 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Court also ruled that the company was entitled to discovery based on the facts of the case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the judgment, Biomet has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Biomet also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The judgment also prohibits Biomet from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in a foreign jurisdiction, and bars it from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in any jurisdiction for the purpose of discovery. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the Northern District of Indiana, charges Heraeus with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) and (4) and 17a-1 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of those provisions. The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction, a civil penalty, and an order requiring Biomet to surrender certain of its documents in the event of a court order. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and the case will be supervised by Amy C. Welshhans."
