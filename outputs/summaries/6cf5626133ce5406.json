  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment against New Jersey's Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services, and New Jersey Secretary of State Patrick McCluskey in a parallel action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, alleges that the state's Medicaid program, the \"Medicaid Only Program\" (ABD), requires states to provide medical assistance to people with disabilities. According to the complaint, the ABD program is intended to provide assistance to aged, blind, and disabled individuals who are eligible for the program. The complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder, the state agency failed to consider the family size of an individual when determining eligibility for ABD benefits. The SEC alleges that in addition to failing to consider family size, the federal agency improperly applied a method of calculating the income of certain family members of an eligible adult or child that did not meet the federal poverty income guideline for a family of four or two. In addition, the complaint alleges, the Division improperly applied an income-based calculation methodology to determine eligibility under ABD, which is contrary to the statutory intent of the federal government, and to the eligibility criteria of ABD. The court's order, which was entered yesterday, permanently enjoins the Division from future violations of these provisions, and orders the Division to comply with the court's orders. The Division's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New Jersey Office of Public Health. The litigation will be led by Timothy J. Donahue. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Department of Banking and Insurance, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
