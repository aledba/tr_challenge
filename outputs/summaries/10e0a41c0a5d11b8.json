  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian, Inc. (\"Hoag\"), a Newport Beach, California acute care hospital, for filing an administrative appeal in violation of the federal and state laws and regulations.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Santa Rosa, California, Hoag filed an Administrative Appeal on May 19, 2012, alleging that the Department of Health Care Services improperly included a calculation error in a calculation of the number of days of covered inpatient nursery care that should not have been included in an audit finding.  The complaint alleges that Hoag failed to timely respond to the Department's determination that the calculation error was an independent and simple calculation error.  Hoag also alleged that the department improperly included \"nursery days\" in its calculation of those days subject to the reductions required by the assembly bills.  In a second administrative appeal, filed on May 29, 2017, the same day the OAHA issued an order to show cause for the dismissal of Hoag's administrative appeal of the $2,413,623 calculation error, the first of two administrative appeals filed by Hoag.  On December 13, 2013, the court granted Hoag a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,038, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Department has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Hoag from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions, orders Hoag to comply with the court's order, and imposes an administrative proceeding against him that is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Health and Human Services. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter."
