  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on April 18, 2017, entered a final judgment against Jonathon Barthalow, a felon who was convicted of burglary, a Level 3 felony.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Richmond, Indiana, alleges that, on November 10, 2017 at the request of the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, Barthanow entered a guilty plea in a felony burglary conviction on a felony battery charge.  According to the complaint, the jury deliberated for less than an hour before finding Barthow guilty of the felony battery, which requires the defendant to show reasonable cause of bodily injury.  In a parallel action, on April 20, 2018, a federal district court in Indianapolis entered a judgment of consent against Barthalowe, finding him guilty of felony battery for the burglary conviction and ordering him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  Bartholeow has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, Barhalfow has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any securities in the United States, other than for the purpose of obtaining a court-ordered injunction against future violations.  On April 21, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Barthonyow, charging him with violating the antipharmaceutical and securities registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(3) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Separately, the Court of Appeals has issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an order suspending or issuing a temporary restraining order, imposing a civil penalty, and appointing an officer and director of a public company to conduct an independent examination of the company's books and records.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The litigation will be led by Jennifer A. Basinger."
