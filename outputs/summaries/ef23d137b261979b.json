  "summary": "On September 11, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment in favor of the trustee against Providence Financial Investments, Inc. and Providence Fixed Income Fund, LLC (collectively the \"Providence Entities\") for the jointly administered bankruptcy estate of Providence Financial.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, Providence Financial and its trustee, Antonio Buzaneli, solicited investors to purchase promissory notes, the proceeds of which would be used to provide working capital in the form of intercompany loans to various businesses in Brazil.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the debtors commingled funds and were operated without corporate formalities such that their independent identities were non-existent and they were merely alter egos of the Debtors.  As alleged in the complaint, the trustee's claims, which were not subject to arbitration, were instead diverted to other uses, some being used to pay principal and interest payments to old investors.  In a parallel action, on June 7, 2016, the SEC charged Providence Financial with aiding and abetting a Ponzi scheme that from 2010 to 2016 raised over $64 million in the United States and $150 million worldwide.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Trustee consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Providence Financial from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the trustee to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the trustee's civil penalty.    The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
