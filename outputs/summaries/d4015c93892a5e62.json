  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against a former member of the Traveling Vice Lords (TVL) gang who was convicted of premeditated murder, four aggravated batteries, and criminal possession of a firearm.  The court also issued a temporary restraining order halting the motion for a new trial.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, Missouri, Marquel D. Dean, who was in a relationship with one of the members of the TVL, was shot in the leg while standing outside a restaurant in June 2013. The complaint alleges that Dean was the only person present at the party at the time of the shooting, and that he was not present when he shot Gary. The SEC also alleges that, in a parallel case, Dean was present in the room when he confronted Gary and told him that he hoped to receive a reduced sentence in exchange for testifying for the State in Dean's case. Dean allegedly told Gary that he had a \"cooperating witness\" who would \"act as a cooperator in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\" The complaint further alleges that when Dean confronted Gary, Gary took a fighting position and shot him at close range. Dean then changed into a red shirt, ambushed Gary, and shot Gary in the stomach. The court denied Dean's motion for new trial on the basis of insufficient evidence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Missouri today announced criminal charges against Dean.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation entered a partial judgment against Dean that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Dean consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws. The judgment also prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any officer-and-director or director-of-a-state program. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Dean also agreed to a five-year conduct-based suspension from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The final judgment also requires him to be barred from appearing, practicing, or participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to a jury trial. Dean has agreed to be permanently suspended from appearing and practicing"
