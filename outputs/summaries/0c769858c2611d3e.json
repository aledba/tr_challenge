  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a Florida-based healthcare company in a medical malpractice case.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on March 12, 2012, Perry Harvey, a Medicare beneficiary, was admitted to the hospital for severe pain and suffering. According to the complaint, the hospital agreed to pay $619,115.82 to settle a claim by the Harvey Estate, which alleged that it was responsible for the development of Mr. Harvey\u2019s pressure sores and sepsis. The complaint further alleges that the hospital had agreed not to include any medical expenses in the arbitration award, and that it had not paid the arbitration amount to the estate. The SEC alleges that in agreeing to this settlement, the Hospital and its estate agreed to the payment of $700,050.73, with a line item of zero for medical expenses. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, on September 21, 2013, a federal district court in Orlando, Florida, entered a judgment against the Hospital for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court granted the hospital's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the amount of the settlement, and a civil injunctive action. The case was investigated by the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, which has issued an Investor Alert on the subject of this matter. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Health and Human Services."
