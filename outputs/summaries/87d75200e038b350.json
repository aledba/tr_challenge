  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Filipino woman accused of failing to provide care for an elderly person.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in February 2009, Tita G. Trajano, a resident of the Philippines, provided live-in home health care for Richard Brown, an elderly man with severe Alzheimer's disease.  According to the complaint, after Richard fell on the floor, he was unable to move or stand up, and the family believed that Richard had fallen out of bed and had difficulty moving around without a cane or walker.  In a complaint filed in federal court in Boone County, the SEC alleges that defendant failed to act in good faith when she knew or reasonably should have known that her efforts were necessary to maintain the health of Richard Brown.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant did not make a good[-]faith effort to provide for Richard's health.  Instead, the complaint alleges, defendant provided Richard with a list on a desk in the kitchen that contained contact information for the family, Joyful Hearts Home Health Support, Inc. (Joyful Hearts), and BrightStar Healthcare (BrightStar), to provide the necessary services.  After Richard fell, the family sought care for him, but he was physically combative and walked around all night shouting.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $50,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $75,000 civil penalty.  On May 16, 2009, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the return of the defendant's passport, which was deemed satisfied by the court's finding that the defendant acted with reasonable and reasonable knowledge when, in fact, she had not made a good-faith effort at providing for Richard, despite repeated requests from the family to do so.  A hearing on May 17, 2009 was scheduled for 5:30 p.m.  To determine whether to impose civil penalties against the defendant, a hearing will be held at a later date.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-12-21(a)(2) (West 2008).  The case is being handled by David Triplett, Mitchell Scott King, and Amy Gwiazda of the Chicago Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Office of Public Health and the Division of Criminal Justice's Office of Health Education and Advocacy."
