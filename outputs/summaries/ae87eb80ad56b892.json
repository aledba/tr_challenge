  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Key Energy Services, LLC, a Mississippi-based company that provided temporary labor in Williston, Mississippi.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, on February 3, 2015, Michael McCallon was injured when the taxi in which he was a passenger was hit by another vehicle. The complaint alleges that, in the course and scope of his employment with Key Energy services, he was injured while performing a work-related injury and was unable to participate in a functional capacity evaluation as required by the Louisiana Workers' Compensation Act.  The complaint further alleges that in one of the instances, Mr. McCallionon was not injured when he performed his work related injury, but rather injured during a taxi ride to and from work.  As alleged in the complaint, the injuries were caused by the third parties with whom they settled claims, and the employer had not paid the employees any compensation when they settled their claims.  In another instance, the complaint alleged that the employee was injured in a car accident when the car driver lost control of the vehicle and rolled over, severally injuring his L-3 vertebra.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Key Energy has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty and attorney fees in the amount of $12,500 of $25,000, which is equal to the amount owed to the employer in the settlement.  Key Energy also has agreed to pay $1,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in a parallel action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Ms. Smith. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Mississippi Department of Insurance. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov."
