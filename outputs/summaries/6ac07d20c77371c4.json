  "summary": "On June 18, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the town of Dryden, New York, ordering the town to adopt a supersession clause that preempts local zoning laws that govern oil and gas operations.  The court entered the final judgment on June 19, 2014.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, the town's zoning ordinance, which prohibits the use of any type of oil or gas drilling, was preempted by a provision in the state's municipal zoning laws.  In addition, the court found that the town had the authority to impose a \"clear expression of legislative intent\" to preempt any local laws or ordinances that were not specifically required by the state.  As a result of the court's order, Dryden and Middlefield were unable to comply with the proposed supersession, which, in effect, prohibited all drilling, extraction and storage activities within their town boundaries.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Town Board, by a unanimous vote, agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the town from violating the preemption provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders the Town to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The court also ordered the Town Attorney's Office to conduct an investigation into the matter. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the New York Office of the Inspector General's Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Gregory Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Environmental Conservation, and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0For more information, see Investor Alert:\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange Advisors.gov (Advisers.gov)\u00c2\u00a0On June 20, 2019, the SEC issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of overproduction of oil, gas, and solution mining in the Marcellus Shale, warning investors to be aware of the risks posed by overproduction.
