  "summary": "The Missouri Department of Agriculture today announced that it has obtained a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 261 of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri, alleges that, on March 8, 2017, the Honorable Leroy Raymond of Kansas City, Missouri, terminated Gregory Stiens for failing to meet minimum standards of performance; habitual tardiness; submitting false statements; and violating agency regulations.  According to the complaint, Stiens was suspended in February 2017 for misconduct and violating the terms of his conditional employment.  In March 2017, on recommendation of the program director and division director, Raymond issued a termination letter to Stiens, stating that the termination was effective as of March 8 and that he was subject to termination for three days.  As alleged, the termination letter was issued \"in the interest of efficient administration and so that the good of the [service] will be served.\"  The complaint also alleges that in February 2018, the Human Resources (HR) director terminated Mr. Stiens.  Raymond also terminated him for violating the department's policy or probation provisions.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Raymond has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and imposing an officer-and-director bar.  Stiens has also agreed to be permanently enjoined from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  On May 2, 2017 the Hon. Raymond issued an order requiring him to comply with certain performance expectations, including that he performed country of origin labeling inspections on March 2 and 3, despite his supervisor\u2019s prohibition of that activity on February 22, 2014, in violation of policy inspection procedures; and (b) failed to synchronize his computer to the WinWam at the end of the day on March 1, 2, 3, and 7, 2017.  He has agreed to a permanent injunction, to be followed by a conduct-based injunction, and to pay an officer and director bar of $150,000.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  This case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Ms. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Missouri Attorney General's Office in this matter."
