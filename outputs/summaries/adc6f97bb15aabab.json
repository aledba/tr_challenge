  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered final judgments against St. Louis Composting, Inc., a Missouri-based composting facility, and its owner in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in 2017, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (DNR) issued a water-discharge permit to Valley Park, Inc. (\"Valley Park\"). The DNR issued the permit on August 27, 2018, without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, and the DNR subsequently issued a final judgment that permanently enjoins Valley Park from pursuing its appeal of the permit. The final judgment also orders Valley Park to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be imposed by the court upon the aggrieved party. The court also granted Valley Park the right to a temporary restraining order, which prohibits it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 621.250 of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay an $8,500 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Valley Park. The SEC also issued an order freezing Valley Park's assets, freezing its assets, and issuing an emergency asset freeze.  According to the SEC's order, Valley Park filed an emergency action on August 29, 2017, which was followed by an administrative hearing on September 28, 2018. The Court granted the SEC and DNR's request for an asset freeze and other emergency relief, including an order appointing a receiver to oversee the issuance and review of the permits. The Commission's order also prohibits Valley Park and the receiver from participating in the issuance, review, or issuance of any permit without prior approval from the agency. The complaint also seeks an injunction against future violations of Section 536.087, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as an order requiring the receiver to file an application within thirty days of the issuance of a permit. In addition, the SEC seeks an order suspending Valley Park\u2019s receipt of a court order requiring it to submit an application for a permit within 30 days after the Commission issued its permit.  On September 28th, the court granted the Commission an order to halt the issuing of permits and to appoint a receiver for the receiver. The order also provides for the appointment of an administrative receiver to determine the timing and amount of any administrative relief that the receiver will receive."
