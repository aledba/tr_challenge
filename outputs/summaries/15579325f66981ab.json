  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered final judgments against Aegis Senior Communities, LLC (Aegis), a California-based senior living community, and three other defendants for violating the right to compel arbitration.  The court also entered a final judgment ordering Aegis to pay $1.2 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the court's order, Aegis and Newirth filed a second amended complaint in April 2016, alleging that Aegis engaged in a scheme to defraud seniors by falsely representing that staffing levels would be determined by the overall needs of the residents, when in fact staffing was based on budget considerations.  Aegis then filed a third amended complaint, in which it made no mention of arbitration or the arbitration agreements, and instead filed a stipulated agreement a week before it had withdrawn its second amended motion.  In a parallel action, the court denied Aegis\u2019s request for a judgment on the merits of the other defendants\u2019 claims, and Aegis entered into a settlement agreement that permanently enjoins Aegis from future violations of the federal securities laws and requires it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. Aegis also agreed to settle the other amended complaint without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order. The court granted Aegis a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against future violations, and the parties agreed to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each. The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-11.   The SEC's complaint charges Aegis with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 16(a)(1) and Rule 16a-3 thereunder, as well as an order appointing a receiver to oversee the settlement. The complaint also names Aegis as a defendant in violation of Section 15(e) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  It seeks a judgment ordering it to disgorge all of its allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to Court approval. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the"
