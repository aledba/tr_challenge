  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the Jewish Federation of Palm Springs and the Desert Area (JF&E), an entity that was formed in 2001.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Las Vegas on March 25, 2009, Gray was appointed as trustee of the Edward B. Cantor Trust.  The complaint alleges that Gray filed an amended accounting for the Cantor Trust in 2005, which omitted the provision of a reserve for depreciation.  In addition, the complaint alleges, Gray filed a second amended accounting in 2006 that omitted the reserve and the amount of depreciation that was paid out of principal.  As alleged in the complaint, the amended accounting did not adequately account for the expenses incurred on behalf of the Cantor trust.  Instead, the court found that Gray was liable for attorney's fees and the fees of her attorney because she did not file a proper accounting.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Gray agreed to the final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay $54,782.52 in attorney fees and a $1,500 civil penalty.  Jimenez agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and ordering Gray to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest of $2,500, and to pay civil penalties of $50,000.  Gray has also agreed to be permanently enjoined from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any offering of a penny stock.  On June 12, 2010, the SEC filed a civil action against Jimenez, charging him with violations of Section 16373, Section 13(b)(3), and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Erwin and supervised by Marc Blau of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Erwin. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
