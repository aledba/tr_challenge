  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in favor of the Air Force Reserve's request for a temporary restraining order against Roseberry-Andrews, an Air Force reservist who was placed on active duty in 2003 and 2006.  According to the court's order, Roseberry\u2013Andrews filed a complaint in August 2002 alleging that various Air Force personnel violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by denying her requests to be transferred to a court that had jurisdiction over her claims.  The court also found that, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder, that Roseberry's claims were not subject to subject matter jurisdiction, and that she had exhausted all of her administrative remedies.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against her for her role in the alleged misconduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the court also ordered Roseberry to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion of the court.  On May 28, 2004, the Court granted the request for an emergency restraining order and issued an order temporarily restraining Roseberry from further violations of the securities laws, ordering her to return to duty, and ordering the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order.  Separately, on May 29, 2007, the Honorable Judge John R. Rymas of the Court of Federal Claims granted the requested emergency relief order and ordered the return of all of the injured and ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and other relief sought by Roseberry and others in her complaint.  A hearing is scheduled for June 5, 2013.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13-cv-1771 (Aug. 24, 2003).
