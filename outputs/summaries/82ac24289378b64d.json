  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Derrick A. Ford, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison on two felony counts of second degree kidnapping.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on January 3, 2016, Ford, then a private investigator with the Jefferson Parish Public Defender's Office, made material misrepresentations to the court about the nature of the alleged non-unanimous jury verdicts.  According to the complaint, the jury was told that defendant pled guilty to distribution of cocaine within 2,000 feet of a drug-free zone and attempted simple robbery in violation of the federal securities laws.  Instead, the complaint alleges that defendant entered a guilty plea on count one of the charges, which he knew was inadmissible because he was a fourth-felony offender under La. C.R.P. art. 782A.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Ford consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Ford for his role in the scheme.  On January 24, 2017, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the New Orleans District Court entered a temporary restraining order against Ford, ordering him to surrender his passport, and barring him from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  As part of the settlement, Ford agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  He also agreed to a five-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future and to be subject to court approval of any such order.  Ford also agreed not to participate in any solicitation of a penny stock or offering of penny stock, and agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against further violations of the securities laws and to the appointment of a receiver for the purpose of recovering stolen property from the receiver.  Finally, the settlement is subject to approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
