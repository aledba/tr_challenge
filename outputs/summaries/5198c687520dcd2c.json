  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Utah today entered a final judgment in favor of the Wakaya and Youngevity International Corp. (collectively, the \"First-to-file\" test) in a parallel federal case.  The court previously ruled that the first- to-file test applies only where there is concurrent federal litigation.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Utah, the Utah case was the first to be handled by a federal court.  In its judgment, the court held that the court should not impose a \"first to file\" rule on a state-federal case, as it did not consider the applicability of the Colorado River test when deciding whether to suspend the Utah action.  As a result of the court\u2019s ruling, the defendants were not able to proceed with their litigation in state court, and the court found that the First to File test applied only when there was a parallel case in federal court and that an arbitrator would need to decide the arbitrability of Wakaya's claims.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Court also ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is $20,000 more than the penalty imposed by the court on Wakaya.  On the same day, the District Court in Utah issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants\u2019 assets, and ordering them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $10,000.   The SEC also issued an order suspending the defendants from participating in any securities offering or offering trading in the securities of any broker-dealer or municipal securities dealer.
