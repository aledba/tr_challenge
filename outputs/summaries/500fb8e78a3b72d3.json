  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Charles I. Hansing, a California resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 13a-14 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, in 2006, the Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Association (\"BADDA\") adopted an operating rule that prevents a person from seeking a position on the board of directors of a public association.  As alleged in the complaint, the ABDA's operating rule is not consistent with the qualifications and qualifications of candidates for the Board of Directors, and is inconsistent with the governing documents.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2010, the association adopted a relationship rule that prohibits a prospective board member from seeking an appointment as a member of the association, even if the existing leadership at a particular development did not think such a person was \"good enough\" to serve as a board member.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hansing consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of any association for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Diskin and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Secretary of State's Office, and the California Office of Financial Regulation."
