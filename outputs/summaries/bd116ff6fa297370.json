  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a prenuptial agreement fraud case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 25, 2017, John F. Dejak, a resident of Ohio, was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the alleged misconduct, the defendant was entitled to 20% of the assets as set forth in the agreement.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the magistrate did not err in failing to require the defendants to file timely objections to the magistrate's decision.  Instead, the complaint alleges, as alleged, that the magistrate improperly relied solely upon the statement of assets that the parties had signed and failed to disclose to the parties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the attorney-client privilege and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their respective assets.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against DeJak.  On November 5, 2018, the court issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants' assets, and imposing a civil penalty of $100,000. The court's order also prohibits the defendants from using the broker-dealer registration provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 13b2-2 thereunder, and requires the parties to provide timely and complete disclosure of all assets and debts. The magistrate also ordered the parties not to obstruct or impede the filing of the complaint. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David A. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Klotz. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Department of Justice, and the Ohio State Attorney General's Office."
