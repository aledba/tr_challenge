  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.  The SEC's complaint, filed on July 7, 2008, alleges that several prison officials violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants consented to the magistrate judge\u2019s jurisdiction based on the fact that they knew of the alleged misconduct.  Branch also alleges that, while incarcerated at Avenal State Prison in 2004, he submitted a declaration in support of another prisoner's complaint in violation of Section 636(c)(4).  The complaint further alleges that one of the prison officers and another officer who screened the other prisoner's motion to withdraw consent did not act with total confidence in their ability to determine whether Branch was entitled to a hearing or jury trial.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Branch failed to inform his counsel that he was being questioned by a magistrate judge about the timing of the discovery of the Chronos.  As a result, Branch was repeatedly transferred between prison facilities over a short period of time, and Branch was then \"confronted\" by fellow inmates who stood by and watched the beating without intervening or sounding the alarm.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Branch agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and appointing a receiver to determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the parties.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Aug. 16, 2013).  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced criminal charges against Branch arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On August 2, 2014, the SEC filed an emergency action against Branch, charging him with violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5 thereunder, and with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Adviser Advisers\") and\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act\u00c2\u00a0\u00a7\u00c2\u00a0Exchange Advisers Rule\u00c2\u00a0#206(2) and Rule 206(3)\u00c2\u00a08 thereunder (\"Adjudicator Advisers\").  The court found that Branch violated Sections 5(a) and (c)"
