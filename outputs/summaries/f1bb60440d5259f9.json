  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland today entered a final judgment in favor of a Maryland man who was sentenced to prison for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that on October 1, 2006, Edwin Robles filed a motion to modify child support based on a 2012 change in the federal law that prevents child support arrearages from accruing when a parent is incarcerated.

The court also ordered the OCEA to conduct an audit and to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support the findings of the Commission's investigation.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-1038(a)(2)(i)(2) (2007).  The complaint also alleges that, in a parallel proceeding, the SEC improperly issued a cease-and-desist order for Robles to file a motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, and that the court improperly issued an order granting the request for an injunction against further enforcement of the securities laws.  Finally, the complaint alleges that the Court improperly granted the court's order for a delay in issuing an order requiring an accounting of the amount owed to an obligor, which"
