  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of North Dakota today entered a final judgment against Bismarck Police Officer Joseph Olsen in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fargo, North Dakota, alleges that, on July 1, 2017, Olsen stopped and questioned King about the right to refuse a chemical test.  According to the complaint, King replied that he read the implied consent advisory to King after he was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and refusing to submit to the test. The complaint alleges that King replied, \u201cIf you have refused the prior screening test, you may cure that refusal by completing this additional chemical test.\"  The complaint further alleges that when King refused to take the chemical test, Olsen informed him that he had a right to consult with an attorney before he took the test, and that he was entitled to that right.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against King.  King has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, King has consented to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Minnesota Department of Insurance, and the Minnesota Office of Criminal Justice."
