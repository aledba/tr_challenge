  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Roger C. O'Brien, who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in West Virginia, alleges that, from January 29, 2016 through January 30, 2016, defendant Robert C. Clarner entered a guilty plea to first degree murder, which was a Class 2 felony. According to the complaint, the plea agreement provided that, in exchange for a specific sentence, the defendant would be required to withdraw his guilty plea and receive a penalty equal to the amount of his sentence. The complaint further alleges that defendant knew at the time he entered the plea that he would not serve a term of the same felony, but received a different, more onerous sentence than the one he agreed to. In granting the defendant's request to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, the court also granted the defendant a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the SEC's orders. The court also denied defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 12-3.05 of the Exchange Act.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia today announced criminal charges against Clarner. The SEC is continuing its investigation. The case is being handled by Eric R. Werner and Glenn S. Gordon of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner, Ms. Gordon, and Ms. Werner."
