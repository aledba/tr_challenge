  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Idaho today entered a final judgment against Idaho Water Resources, Inc. (\"IDWR\") (\"BCID\"), a water rights company based in Pocatello, Idaho, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 31, 2013, the Idaho Department of Water Resources (IDWR) decreed water rights to 700,000 and 163,000 AFY in Cascade Reservoirs.  The complaint alleges that the late claims were precluded because, as the complaint alleges, the early claims were inconsistent with the status of the existing water rights.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, the Late Claims were unnecessary because the existing rights already authorize the right to water in priority after flood control releases.  BCID also alleges that in addition to failing to fulfill its preclusion criteria, the late Claims are unnecessary because they are duplicative of the rights already decreed.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, BCID consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, the SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in this matter.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against BCID. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley and Ms. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Scott A. Kasper."
