  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Dow Roofing Systems, LLC and its subsidiary, Appellee Chamberlin Dallas, LLC f/k/a Chamberlin Roofing & Waterproofing, Ltd., in a civil action brought by the Church of the United States Virgin Islands.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas on March 24, 2015, Dow and Chamberlin raised the issue of arbitration with the Church, alleging that the arbitration provision in the Limited Warranty provided for a ten-year term starting with the date of substantial completion and the date that the parties executed the roofing system.  The complaint further alleges that, in reality, the defendants did not have the power to determine the scope of an arbitration provision.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Dow had the right to unilaterally nullify the agreement in its entirety, and the parties never amended the contract after its execution.  As alleged in the complaint, the Church's claims fell within the scope and scope of a valid arbitration provision, and thus, the parties could not compel arbitration of their claims without violating the federal securities laws.  For example, in one of the cases, the SEC alleges that the Church violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Dow has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Dow has also agreed to a settlement in which it will pay a $500,000 civil penalty.  On March 16, 2016, a federal district court in New Jersey issued an order requiring Dow to submit arbitration questions to an arbitrator, and Dow has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment ordering an injunction against the imposition of any such injunction.  This order requires Dow to show that it has complied with the requirements of the federal arbitration rules, and that it is entitled to a court-ordered injunction against any violation of the arbitration provisions.  Additionally, the court granted Dow's motion to compel arbitration on the basis that it had failed to establish a defense to arbitration of its claims.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Fort Worth Regional Office, and is being supervised by Eric Werner of the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance"
