  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against Colorado resident Stormy Bob Griffith for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Griffith, who was previously convicted of possession of a Schedule I controlled substance.  According to the court's order, filed on August 29, 2013, and unsealed on January 16, 2019, Mr. Griffith, then a resident of Cedaredge, Colorado, claimed that he was in compliance with the federal marijuana laws when, in fact, he was not.  As alleged in the court order, however, that Griffith was not in compliance, and that the court improperly imposed a two-level increase for possession of marijuana.  In a parallel action, on January 17, 2020, the United States Attorney's Office for Colorado announced criminal charges against Griffith.  On January 19, 2020 the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary injunction, ordered a temporary asset freeze, and ordered Griffith to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Mr., who was a Colorado resident at the time of his arrest, consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement of $2,965, and prejudgment interest of $192,038, and a civil penalty of $250,000.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Denver Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado State Attorney General's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-1365 (Dec. 20, 2016).  The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
