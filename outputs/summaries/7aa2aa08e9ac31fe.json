  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Nalco Co. v. Chem-Mod, LLC, a company based in Fargo, North Dakota, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, alleges that, from at least April 8, 2014 through at least September 2015, defendants directly or indirectly violated the \"692\" patent for the treatment of coal combustion flue gas.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to adequately plead to the court's finding that they had violated Section 5 of the federal securities laws and that, in fact, they had not violated the patent.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants directly and indirectly violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(b)(6) and (3) of that federal securities law.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  On September 14, 2016, the U. S. District Judge in Chicago issued a temporary restraining order, which temporarily enjoins defendants from further violations of the charged provisions, as well as ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and requires them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties of $1,500, and pay a $100,000 civil penalty in the amount of $20,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-2510 (Feb. 24, 2016).   \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
