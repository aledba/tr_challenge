  "summary": "On May 3, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia entered a final judgment in favor of a West Virginia-based electric utility, AmBit Power Partners, L.P., that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders AmBit to pay a $34.25 per megawatt-hour avoided-cost fee to a qualifying facility. AmBit agreed to pay the fee on the condition that the PSC allow Mon Power to pass the additional $27.74 on to its retail customers. According to the court's order, the agreed-upon rate was reasonable, reasonable, and reasonable to the utility's customers. The court also found that AmBit could not afford to pay more than the avoided costs, because the avoided cost was equal to the amount of electricity it would have received from the qualifying facility at the time it purchased electricity from the generating plant. In addition, the court ruled that the fee paid to AmBit was reasonable when measured against the \"levelized avoided cost\" of the agreement, and that it was reasonable for the utility to pass on the additional avoided costs to its customers.  The court's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, reserves the issue of whether to impose a permanent injunction, impose a civil penalty, and bar AmBit from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any electricity in the future. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for West Virginia today announced criminal charges against AmBit. The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia Secretary of State's Office, and the Virginia Department of Commerce in this matter."
