  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a temporary restraining order against a Washington Teachers' Union (WTU) motion seeking to have an arbitrator determine whether a class action/group grievance filed by a public school employee is arbitrable.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Columbia, DC, WTU claimed that, in pursuing a group grievance under its collective bargaining agreement with the district of Columbia, it failed to allege a single fact applicable to the entire group of over 180 teachers who had \"received less than Effective ratings\" under the evaluation process. In addition, the complaint alleged that, contrary to WTU's claims, the CTU had not obtained the required \"consent of the individual grievants\" in the group grievance, and that the scope of the requested arbitration was too broad for the court to determine whether WTU may pursue arbitration of that particular grievance.  The complaint further alleges that WTU failed to provide a clear statement of expectations in the area of CSC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC charged WTU with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (\"Advisers\").  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Compliance and Assessments with the assistance of the Division of Education's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Basinger and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the District Attorney's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
