  "summary": "On June 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered final judgments against Surgery Center at 900 North Michigan Avenue, LLC and American Physicians Assurance Corporation, Inc., which together constitute a medical malpractice insurance company that insured Surgery Center.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Surgery Center performed laparoscopic surgery on Gwendolyn Tate on November 26, 2002. The complaint alleges that Dr. Harrith Hasson performed the surgery on Tate at Surgery Center, where he was not a practicing physician, and provided that he did not see Tate or sign her discharge instructions before the surgery center released her.  The complaint further alleges that shortly after surgery, the complaint was filed in the Illinois Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the court granted summary judgment to Surgery Center in May 2003.  In its judgment, the court held that Surgery Center had a duty to settle and that it would defend and indemnify Surgery Center for claims that fell within the policy\u2019s coverage.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Court also held that the SEC had a reasonable chance of finding liability for Surgery Center when, in fact, it did not have a reasonable probability of recovering on the excess policy limit.  As a result of the court finding, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as a civil penalty against the defendant.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jennifer Lowis and Guita Griffiths of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Ms. Lowis, Ms. Griffiths, and Mr. Smith. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Secretary of State's Office and the Illinois Department of Insurance. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.
