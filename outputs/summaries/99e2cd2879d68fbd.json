  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan today entered a final judgment in favor of the City of Detroit against International Outdoor Inc., a Michigan-based company that sought to obtain a use variance in an area of the city designated as the Grand Boulevard overlay zone.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Michigan, in 2011, International Outdoor purchased a parcel of vacant property in Detroit that was zoned for agricultural with the intention of acquiring the property with the knowledge that the city's ordinance prohibited off-site advertising.  The complaint alleges that the property was then divided into two parcels, one of which IO purchased with the intent of one day erecting a billboard on the property, and the other parcel that IO purchased without knowing the ordinance was inapplicable to any reasonable use.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against IO, alleging that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, IO consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the BZA from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer in violation of the federal securities laws, and orders IO to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  IO also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Janssen and supervised by Marc Blau of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Commerce, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Michigan Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
