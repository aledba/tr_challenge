  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland yesterday entered a final judgment against Resource Capital Corp., a Maryland real estate investment trust, on the basis of material facts.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that Resource Capital violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Resource Capital's investment in a mezzanine loan was secured by a portfolio of thirteen luxury hotels, including three hotels in Puerto Rico. The complaint alleges that the loan was in difficulty, such that its payment of interest had ceased, and any wound inflicted by the default would be temporary and manageable.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the McKinney demand, Resources and its officers and directors agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of judgments that impose permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On June 1, 2017, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Mascianica granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The court's order freezes the assets of Resource Capital, its officers, directors, and external auditors, and orders the company to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.5 million, $2 million, and $1 million, respectively.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations, with assistance from Michael LiPuma. The litigation will be led by Messrs. Fore, Spiegel, and Sebenoler. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.  For more information, see Investor.gov."
