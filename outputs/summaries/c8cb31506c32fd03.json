  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against a parole revocation hearing officer for failing to stipulate to a commissioner that he or she would conduct a hearing to revoke a defendant's parole.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in June 2017, Brandon James Berch agreed to the appointment of a hearing officer to conduct parole revocation hearings and commit him to jail for violating the terms of his parole. Berch also agreed to participate in a postjudgment order revoking his parole and committing a defendant to jail. The SEC alleges that Berch consented to the hearing officer\u2019s participation at both the preliminary and final hearings.  Berch was sentenced to 120 days in jail with a total of 66 days credit for time served.  According to the SEC, Berch has already served the mandatory minimum of 12 months in prison.  In a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today filed an emergency action, charging Berch with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Commission has agreed to a final judgment that permanently enjoins Berch from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $10,000 in civil penalties. The Commission has also agreed not to revoke Berch's parole, which is a subordinate judicial duty of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, and to pay a $1,000 civil penalty to be determined by the court upon motion of the Commission. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On July 7, 2017, the court granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order against Berch, which was subsequently granted by the Commission, and ordered Berch to surrender his passport. The court also issued an order requiring the Commission to conduct a prejudgment hearing in the absence of a stipulation, and requiring the Commissioner to provide a copy of the order to the Commission that would determine whether to revoke parole or impose a pre-judgment judgment.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a preliminary injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against the Commission from participating in or performing any of the above-mentioned judicial duties.\u00c2\u00a0 The Commission's order was subsequently revoked and Berch pleaded guilty to the same felony."
