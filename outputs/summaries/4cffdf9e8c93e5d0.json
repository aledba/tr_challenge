  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Justice, and Federal Bureau of Investigation against them.  The SEC's complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that, in violation of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, the federal securities laws that govern the issuance of and purchase of health insurance.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to adequately disclose to the court that the federal agency that issued the federal injunction did not have the authority to issue the final rules.  In its judgment, the court held that the agencies likely lacked the statutory authority under the federal law to issue those final rules and that they did not impose any reasonable expectation that the plaintiffs would be subjected to the injunction.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the federal injunctions and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,500, and requires the Defendants to pay civil penalties of $20,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Hausman and supervised by Spencer E. Amdur. The litigation will be led by Mark R. Sylvester. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California and the Federal Office of Inspector General.
