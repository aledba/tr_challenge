  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against a former arbitrator in a beryllium and copper award case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, alleges that on May 16, 2012, an arbitrator at a hearing in favor of Hoolahan in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the arbitrator's finding of \"unreasonable deference\" to the parties' requests for an award of the award was based on the fact that he had not been suspended prior to termination and had therefore been denied the opportunity to make his first sale.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the arbitrators' finding of unreasonable deference was based solely on the evidence presented to the court.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court agreed to the judgment, which permanently restrains the judgment from the court and orders Hoolah to pay $1,850,162.00 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $135,786. The court also granted the court's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the issuance of an order requiring an attorney to present a written opinion in a civil proceeding, as well as an officer-and-director bar.  On October 11, 2011, a federal district court in Miami, Florida, entered an order permanently enjoining IBC from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering it to comply with the court order, and appointing an independent arbitrator to determine whether to vacate the award.  As part of the settlement, IBC agreed to pay a $1.8 million civil penalty and to be barred from the securities industry for five years.  IBC also agreed to be prohibited from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, municipal bond dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and to pay an officer and director bar in the amount of $2.25 million.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office, and the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office in this matter."
