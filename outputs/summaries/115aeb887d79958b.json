  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against Cody Miller, the former director and president of RAM Sensors, Inc., and defendant-appellee David Miller in a shareholder derivative action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, alleges that, on January 12, 2015, Karen and David Miller entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which they agreed to pay $2,874,437.56 plus interest at the statutory rate of $119,907.18. The settlement agreement also provided that David would be required to pay Karen spousal support of six quarterly payments totaling $450,000.  According to the complaint, however, David had been stealing funds from his brokerage account and mismanaging the company in order to avoid paying Karen's spousals.  Karen's motion to intervene was untimely because the settlement agreement expressly prohibited her from acting as an intervenor in the underlying action and required her to execute a stock pledge agreement.  In addition, the court found that Karen was not a necessary and indispensable party to the action because she had no interest in the funds or the stock.   The court also ruled that Karen had the right to intervene as a matter of right under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and that she had the duty to protect and preserve the interests of her children.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Karen consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $3,554,891.00, plus attorney fees and costs.  On March 21, 2018, nearly one year after the judgment was entered, Karen filed a complaint for divorce against David Miller, alleging that he violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b) and (c) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and requires Karen to comply with certain of the provisions of Section 5(b)(5) and 6(c).  The judgment also prohibits Karen from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in violation of the above-mentioned provisions, and prohibits her from serving as an officer, director, officer, or representative of a public company until the court has satisfied its jurisdiction over the issues raised by the complaint.  For example, the complaint alleges that Karen failed to execute any documents required to secure the consent of the parties to the judgment, including a copy of the consent"
