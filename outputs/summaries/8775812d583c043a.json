  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against a Massachusetts man for refusing to take a breathalyzer test.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, on May 6, 2010, a defendant was arrested for OUI and was subsequently suspended from driving. The complaint alleges that the defendant had three prior convictions of OUI when he refused to take the Breathalyzer, his license was subject to a lifetime suspension, and he was subsequently found not guilty of the 2010 OUI charge.  The complaint further alleges that, after his arrest, the defendant was barred from driving for three prior OUI convictions, and his license had been suspended for a lifetime.  As alleged in the complaint, the suspension was not permanent, and the defendant immediately moved to have his driver's license restored.  In a parallel action, the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against the defendant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, as well as an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any motor vehicle.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains his or her license, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of his and her license suspension.   The court granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order and a hearing before the same judge, and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  A hearing is scheduled for May 24, 2017, for a hearing on the merits of the case.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 4444 (2014).  The SEC's Complaint charges the defendant with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The SEC also seeks a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(e) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and a permanent officer and director bar against defendants who refuse to take or refuse the breathalyszer.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
