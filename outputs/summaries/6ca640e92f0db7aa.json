  "summary": "On May 17, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of Laryssa Jock and her co-defendants in a class action action brought by her employer, Sterling Jewelers Inc. (Sterling).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, in 2008, a federal district court in Manhattan issued a class determination that certified a class of approximately 44,000 women, comprising the then-254 plaintiffs as well as other individuals who had neither submitted claims nor opted in to the arbitration proceeding (\u201cthe absent class members\u201d).  According to the complaint, Jock was not bound by her authority in certifying the class because she, no less than the parties, bargained for the arbitrator\u2019s construction of that agreement with respect to class arbitrability.  The complaint also alleges that Jock did not have the authority to determine whether class arbitration was permissible under the RESOLVE Agreement.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Jock.  Jock is charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Jock II's violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Sterling has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.  Sterling has also agreed to a settlement where she will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations.  On May 19, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action in which it obtained a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing an independent arbitrator to determine class-arbitrability based on the parties\u2019 representations to the court. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  A hearing on May 24, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  To learn more about class arbitration, see Litigation Release No. 569 (January 15, 2018).  In its order, the court also issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the arbitration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and to consider whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant an independent, impartial arbitrator."
