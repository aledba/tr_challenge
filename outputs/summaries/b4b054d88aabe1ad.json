  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against the National Pork Board for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, alleges that the Pork Board improperly approved the purchase of four trademarks associated with the slogan \"The Other White Meat.\"  The complaint also alleges that, in 2006, the Board approved spending $3 million per year to acquire the trademarks for a total of approximately 40% of the organization's annual budget.  As alleged in the complaint, this spending was unnecessary because the Board had already paid for the trademarks in 2006.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2016, the Secretary of Agriculture approved spending the same amount for another year to develop and market an entirely new brand of pork.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on September 24, 2012, the Commission accepted the Commission's request for summary judgment, finding that the Commission violated the federal securities laws, and that it was entitled to a judgment ordering a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities laws and ordering the Commission to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission, the Committee has agreed to the settlement, which is subject to court approval, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a)(1) and 5(c) and orders it to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, and to pay disgorgement of $3,500 plus prejudgment interest of $2,500, and a $50,000 penalty.  On December 9, 2015, the Court granted the Commission a temporary restraining order and ordered it to conduct a review of its books and records to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support its determination of whether to continue making payments under the contract.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office, and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, with assistance from Eric Werner of the Market Abuse Unit, and Antonia Chion of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Chion, and the case will be supervised by Scott Weingarten."
