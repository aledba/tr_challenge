  "summary": "On May 11, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Scott J. Shapiro, Jr. of Saratoga County, N.Y.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in August 2017, Shapiro was charged in a four-count indictment with driving while ability impaired and reckless driving.  According to the complaint, Shapiro told the court that he and his wife both asked him to slow down and \"please slow down you're going too fast.\"  The complaint further alleges that defendant had been drinking water for hours and \"was definitely fine to drive,\" and that defendant was going 58 to 78 miles per hour when he allegedly braked during the accident.  As alleged, the complaint alleges, however, that the Shapiros had retained counsel for purposes of a civil proceeding, and that the judge had not ruled on the merits of the case.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced parallel criminal charges against Shapiro.  On May 12, 2019, the court entered a judgment against Shapiro, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Shapiro consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, imposes a $25,000 civil penalty, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney or practicing as a public figure. The judgment also prohibits Shapiro from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with a criminal conviction, and prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for at least five years. The court also ordered Shapiro to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  A parallel criminal proceeding against Shapiro was conducted by Jeremy Shultis, a State Police investigator specializing in accident reconstruction, and was supervised by David Ennist. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
