  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a Georgia-based funeral home and its owner for defrauding the family out of millions of dollars.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that the funeral home, The Mail Room, and The Postal Service misappropriated the remains of Joel D. Ford, a Georgia resident who passed away in 2018.  According to the complaint, Ford's ashes were sent to a funeral home in Georgia, where the family had his body cremated by a local funeral home.  As alleged, however, none of the ashes were ever located or recovered.  In fact, the complaint alleges, the family's cremated remains were broken into pieces and were never located.  Instead, they arranged for a funeral parlor to ship the ashes to their homes in Texas, Illinois, and Indiana.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1391(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Additionally, the court granted a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the federal securities laws, and ordered the payment of a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1391.2 (4th ed. 2019).  The complaint also names the Georgia funeral home as a defendant, and the Illinois-based Postal Inspection Service as a relief defendant for the purpose of recovering the ashes.  On January 2, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Chicago, alleging that the defendants violated the federal anti-fraud provisions and that they violated the securities laws by failing to disclose material facts or omissions that gave rise to the claims in the complaint. The complaint further alleges that, contrary to the representations of the defendants, the mailroom failed to disclose that the ashes contained shattered \"kitchenware.\"  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against the four defendants. The SEC also announced that it would conduct an asset freeze on the four victims, and that the investigation was conducted by James W. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice, and Arthur R. Miller of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Miller and Ms. Moore."
