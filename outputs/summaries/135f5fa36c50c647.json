  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Alabama today announced criminal charges against Patricia Galbreath, the former County Administrator of Hale County, Alabama.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that Ms.Galbreath violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Ms.galbreath consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $361,757.37.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Commission agreed to a permanent injunction and to the appointment of a probate judge to determine whether a pretermination hearing was required under the federal law.  In a parallel action, the Alabama Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed an emergency action and obtained an emergency court order halting the action.  On September 16, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the County Administrator, Judge Arthur Crawford, and the County Attorney General, charging her with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Department of Justice and the Alabama Office of Inspector General. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
