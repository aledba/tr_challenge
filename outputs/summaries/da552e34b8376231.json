  "summary": "On August 15, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against two convicted sex offenders, J.M. and H.D., for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, alleges that the federal securities laws provide for the registration of sex offenders.  According to the complaint, in 1994 and 1998, both sex offenders were convicted of computer-related theft, a felony that triggered Megan's Law registration requirements, and sentenced to community supervision for life (CSL).  The complaint further alleges that, in 2001, when convicted of a felony, the Legislature amended the registration requirements to include a provision that requires a person to remain offense free for a period of fifteen years following conviction or release from a correctional facility for any term of imprisonment imposed, whichever is later, for the sex offender's underlying conviction.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2001 and 2002, both men were sentenced to prison terms of 15 years and 364 days, respectively, for a third-degree failure to register as a sex offender, N.J. 2C:7-2(a) and (c).  In 2013, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, which temporarily enjoins the defendants from violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (d) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  In 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On August 16, 2018 the UJ District Court in Newark entered a judgment against J.S., M.D. and Rangel, ordering them to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws, ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000, and ordering the offender to pay a $20,000 civil penalty, ordering that the offender be barred from serving any prison term, and imposing a $50,000 penalty on the offender.   The court also granted the defendants' motion to be relieved of their registration obligations and ordered them to pay restitution in a civil case.  As a result, the Court granted the Defendants' requests for an injunction, and the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from further violating the securities"
