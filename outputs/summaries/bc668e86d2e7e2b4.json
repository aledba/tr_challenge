  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment against two Oklahoma men for defrauding investors in a home entertainment center they purchased using a Wells Fargo Financial National Bank/Marquis Furniture, Inc. credit card account.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Norman, Oklahoma, alleges that defendants had defaulted on their Wells Fargo credit card and owed $1,325.47, plus interest, court costs, and a reasonable attorney fee.  According to the complaint, the defendants claimed they had borrowed $2,999.98 to purchase the entertainment center, including the fee charged by the seller, and that the difference in the amount borrowed was withheld to cover the cost of the theater's loss of use. The complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to disclose to the court any contemporaneous correspondence received from the defendants, despite having disputed the debt and having communicated directly on many occasions with Plaintiff and his counsel about that dispute since April 2010.  In its judgment, the court found that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1.898.96. The defendants also agreed to pay disgorgement of $245, which was equal to the amount owed to them in the default judgment.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 1, 2015, the trial court granted the defendants' motion for default judgment against them and ordered them to comply with the court's order to vacate the judgment. The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the court as required by federal law, ordering them to provide an accounting of the amount of money owed to the parties, and ordering the parties to pay an attorney fee in accordance with the agreed-upon amount of the settlement. The judgment also prohibits defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any action by the court. The Court also ordered that defendants comply with a court order that prohibits them from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in securities and from making or selling any offer to sell any security, including securities in the securities industry. The order also requires defendants to provide a written explanation of why they had not paid the disputed $245 of the principal balance in the check that was deposited in their bank account."
