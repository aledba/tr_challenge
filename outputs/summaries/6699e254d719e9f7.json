  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jean Kasem, a Wisconsin resident, for her role in an ongoing administrative proceeding that resulted in a default judgment against her.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 20, 2018, Kasem filed a first amended complaint against defendant Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI) asserting that she was the only counsel for Kasem in violation of Rule 60(b)(6) of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that Kasem failed to file a timely response to the Commission's motion for summary judgment and instead filed an opening brief in support of the motion.  Kasem also allegedly failed to provide any evidence to support her assertion that she had acted negligently in filing the opening brief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Kasem.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Commission has issued an order suspending Kasem from appearing or practicing before the Commission, freezing her assets, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  On August 3, 2019, the Court granted CHI's request for a continuance of the judgment and granted Kasem's motion to withdraw her motion for relief from judgment.  As set forth in the order, the court's order prohibits defendants from acting as unethically or as a control person in connection with a pending administrative proceeding, and requires defendants to show cause and reasonable basis for their actions.  For example, the order prohibits Kasem and CHI from engaging in any conduct that constitutes gross negligence in the context of summary judgment, and prohibits her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future without prior authorization from the Commission.  Additionally, the SEC requires defendants with a history of misconduct to register as a party with the Commission and to provide an accounting of any misconduct that may result in a judgment against them.   The Commission's order also requires Kasem to file an affidavit or declaration with respect to any finding that she has made in the case that she is liable for a penalty in the manner of a judgment that is determined by the Commission by the Court at a later date.  It also requires that the Commission consider whether there is sufficient evidence to determine whether a defendant has committed gross negligence, whether there are reasonable grounds for a judgment, or whether a party has committed misconduct in the course of a criminal proceeding.  Specifically, it requires the Commission to consider whether any reasonable person has established diligence and substantial need for the delay in filing a response to a Commission order. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission has"
