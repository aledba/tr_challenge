  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New York City man accused of perpetrating child sexual abuse.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on August 6, 2016, Christopher Mullen, a licensed clinical nurse practitioner, and his mother, Elizabeth Lashua, consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.

She agreed to settle the case by consenting to a hearing in which she would determine whether to impose a penalty based on the facts presented to her by the trial court, and by consent to the issuance of a court order requiring her to comply with the court's order.

For example, in the case of Messina's case, she agreed to participate in a hearing that was conducted by a certified clinical trial attorney, but did not participate in the selection of a jury.  After the hearing, Messina and Messina each agreed that the jury should determine whether they are entitled to the judgment based upon the evidence presented to them.
