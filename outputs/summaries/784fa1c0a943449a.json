  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania yesterday entered a final judgment against Ray Mabus, the former Secretary of the Navy, for failing to comply with the agency's recommendation that he remove her from his position as Supervisory Security Specialist at the Navy Depot in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that Mabus failed to provide reasonable accommodations for plaintiff's medical condition.  According to the complaint, Mabus was unable to perform the essential functions of his position because of her medical condition, and that the Navy had not deemed her qualified to perform her duties.  Mabus also allegedly failed to show that he was capable of performing the essential duties of his or her position.  In addition, the complaint alleges that plaintiff had a history of medical conditions, including Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and failed to demonstrate that she was able to perform certain functions of her job, such as using the SIPRNET, accessing classified information, traveling, and the required many face to face interactions with other employees at the duty station.   The complaint further alleges that, based on the nature of plaintiff's condition, plaintiff was not able to safely or efficiently perform her job with or without reasonable accommodations.  As a result, the SEC's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins Mabus from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and officer-and-director pay.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, and ordering him not to participate in any federal program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in any type of federal agency or activity that requires him to provide a reasonable accommodation for a person with a disability.  Additionally, the court ordered Mabus to pay $1,078.95, which represents a $2,077.95 civil penalty, and ordered him to be permanently enjoined from serving in any capacity that constitutes a \"qualified individual\" with a \"permanent, full-time job.\"  In a parallel action, the Department of Justice today announced criminal charges against Mabus and Mabus"
