  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Reed Austin Gibson, Jr., a former officer of the Springfield Police Department, for obstructing official business.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ohio on October 31, 2017, alleges that Gibson, who was a member of the Wittenberg Police Department's Division of Criminal Investigations, failed to disclose to the officers that he had engaged in a verbal altercation with an individual who was attempting to obstruct the officers' work.  Gibson also allegedly told the officer that he was going to \"pull on\" the individual, and that he \"was within her rights to be there.\"  Gibson allegedly agreed to the officer's request for a jury instruction, which was overruled by the court.  According to the complaint, Gibson then allegedly refused to give the officer the jury instructions, telling the officer to \"plead the Fifth.\"  The court also ruled that Gibson was not entitled to a jury trial because he had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Gibson.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Gibson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and orders Gibson to pay $75,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a $25,000 civil penalty. Gibson also agreed to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and to be restrained and restrained from making any statements or actions that may be deemed inconsistent with the conduct of the officer or the defendant. Gibson agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval. The settlement is pending final approval by the Court of Common Pleas, which will determine the amount of monetary penalties to be imposed upon Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
