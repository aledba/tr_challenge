  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against the Department of Children and Families in favor of terminating the mother's parental rights as to four of her five children.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, on May 16, 2016, the Department filed a case against the mother alleging that she failed to comply with a court order to terminate her parental rights.  The complaint alleges that the mother was not a model parent and instead sought to conceal her dire financial condition from the Department, sought to rehabilitate the mother, and sought to obtain emergency housing and social services.  As alleged in the complaint, the mother did not complete all of her dyadic therapy sessions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against her.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, which was filed in the U.N.\u0080\u0099s Division of Justice, the Division of Health and Rehabilitation has issued an order suspending the mother from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the termination.  On May 24, the court entered a final judgment against the department, ordering the mother to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and ordering her to pay an $8,500 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000.   The court granted the mother a temporary restraining order against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the Department to conduct a clinical trial to determine whether to proceed with this matter.  To learn more about the importance of parental rights, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1141 (Fla. 4th DCA 2004).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling or offering them investments in their own businesses.  Investors can quickly and easily check whether they are registered professionals by using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify people who are at risk of losing their jobs or having their children incarcerated.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that, based upon the Department's findings, the department failed to adequately evaluate the mother and her children and failed to provide reasonable, convincing evidence that she would not benefit from court-ordered services."
