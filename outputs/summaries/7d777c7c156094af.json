  "summary": "The Kansas Secretary of State's Office today announced that it filed an emergency action against a Kansas City, Kansas man who was given a traffic citation for racing/exhibition of speed, in violation of a city ordinance.  The SEC's complaint alleges that on September 11, 2015, a Topeka municipal court judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing Peter Matthew Ramos from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Kansas Municipal Court Procedures Act.  According to the complaint, Ramos was not sentenced to probation by a district court, but instead received a traffic ticket.  As alleged, Ramos' arrest warrant, which was issued the same day he was sentenced, required him to appear online, plead no contest, and pay his fine.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Kansas today announced criminal charges against Ramos.  On January 21, 2016, the Shawnee County District Court entered a final judgment against Ramos, ordering Ramos to pay a $172,000 civil penalty.  Ramos, who lives in Topeka, Kansas, pleaded no contest on January 26, 2015 and was sentenced to a total of 10 days in prison.  After serving his sentence, Ramos pled no contest and paid his fine and court costs.  At the time of his sentencing, Ramos had 14 days from that date to file his notice of appeal.  Last week, the Kansas Attorney General's Office filed a criminal complaint against Ramos for his role in the alleged scheme.  This case was investigated by the Kansas Department of Justice's Office of Criminal Investigations, which conducted an examination of Ramos' criminal history. The case was supervised by Scott Frost, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Criminal Justice Division. The litigation will be led by Mr. Frost and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Public Safety and the Kansas Office of the Inspector General in this matter."
