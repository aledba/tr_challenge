  "summary": "On April 4, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment against Ramon Pachecho and Associates, Inc. (the \"PACHECO Defendants\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and against Pacheco and the Corporation for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation in connection with the defective air conditioning system in his new home.  The court also found that, in violation of Section 768.79, the federal securities laws, and that the Commission's finding in Gorka did not apply to all claims.  In its judgment, the court held that the defendants were liable to each other for the liability of the other party.  According to the court's order, the defendants agreed to pay $232,440 in disgorgement, $150,000 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their respective fees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders them to pay civil penalties of up to $300,000. The judgment also imposes a $200,000 civil penalty against Pachco and Associates.  Pacho and Associates agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the charged sections of the securities laws and ordering them to disgorge their allegedly illusory gains with interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing on the matter is scheduled for May 5, 2018. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Insurance in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17, July 10, 2016."
