  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against a Kentucky-based attorney who was charged with defrauding a jury in a medical negligence case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Louisville, Kentucky, alleges that, on November 28, 2011, Dr. Charles D. Sherrard, Jr., of Kentucky, provided false testimony to a jury that he was liable for Laura Alexander\u2019s death.  According to the complaint, the jury was told that the jury would determine whether to grant a directed verdict based on the evidence presented by the jury.  Instead, the court granted the jury a temporary restraining order preventing the jury from making a judgment that would impose a permanent injunction, impose a conduct-based injunction, and impose a penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Sherrards.    The case is being handled by Michael J. Waggoner, Chief of the Kentucky Division of Criminal Investigation, and the Office of Public Health and the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kentucky Office of Inspector General, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice's Criminal Division, the Criminal Division's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office."
