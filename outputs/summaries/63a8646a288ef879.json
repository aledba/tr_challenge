  "summary": "On January 22, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with interference with a peace officer.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Wyoming on December 3, 2017, Deputy Bradley Goering of the Teton County Sheriff\u2019s Office stopped a vehicle driven by Christian Garza for driving under the influence of alcohol. The complaint alleges that Mr. Garza refused to comply with a search warrant issued by a judge, which authorized him to take a blood sample from a defendant, and that the officer intended to cite him for speeding.  As alleged in the complaint, however, Garza was not entitled to the blood sample and did not comply with the search warrant.  The complaint further alleges that when the time came for the drawing of the blood from the defendant, he again refused to give it, asserting that he was not allowed to take any blood as ordered by the judge.  In a parallel action, on March 16, 2018, a jury found Garza guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.00.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Mr.Garza consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to return to his car and surrender his driver's license. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Public Finance Abuse Unit, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wyoming Department of Criminal Justice, the FBI, the Federal Office of Inspector General and the Wyoming State Police."
