  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against Colorado-based private property condemnation company CAW Equities, L.L.C. (CAW).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that CAW violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, CAW sought to condemn the entire public trail to construct a ditch from the Highline Canal to the southern end of its properties. CAW's complaint alleges that the federal district court found that the right to condemn was limited by the prior public use doctrine, and that it had to make a showing of necessity for the right-of-way to access its water rights without destroying the existing public trail.  The complaint further alleges that, as alleged in the SEC's judgment, the right of condemnation was not limited by statute, and CAW failed to show that it was authorized to condemn all of the public trail and should not be required to pay attorney fees.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against CAW for its role in the alleged violations of Section 7 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint filed in the United States District Court, the court issued a temporary restraining order and ordered CAW to comply with the court's order and to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of the relief sought by the court.   The court also issued an order suspending CAW from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $25,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Denver Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado Department of Natural Resources."
