  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon today announced criminal charges against a convicted sex offender for failing to report a change of residence.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that, from at least 2012 through at least 2014, the state of Oregon issued a false and misleading statement to the public regarding the mandatory reporting requirements for sex offenders.  According to the complaint, defendants falsely claimed that they were living in a \"residence\" when, in fact, they were not.  In fact, the complaint alleges that defendant had established a residence across the street from the Chevron station, and that he had moved to a new residence shortly after he was released from the jail.  As alleged, however, defendant had not established a new place of residence and had not reported that move to the department of state or federal law enforcement.  Instead, according to the SEC, defendants spent periods of time in jail, at a homeless shelter, and at a public transportation company, all of which were not covered by the reporting requirements.  For example, the SEC alleges that defendants spent most of his time at the shelter, spending time at a bus stop, and in the parking lot behind a Chevron station.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Additionally, defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years, from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a registered sex offender.  Defendants also agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  Finally, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits defendants from making or selling any offer of a security deposit, and ordered the release of any person who has been convicted of a sex-offender-related felony, including a convicted felon, to the Department of State Police, a city police department, or a county sheriff. The court also issued an order requiring defendants to provide a copy of their criminal history and to provide an accounting of their prior criminal history.
