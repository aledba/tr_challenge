  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against Alliant Tax Credit Fund 31-A, Ltd., a Florida-based limited liability company, for fraudulently transferring millions of dollars in cash and commercial paper, stock shares, a mountain cabin, and an apartment complex.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Atlanta, Georgia, Alliant claimed that it was entitled to recover its $8.946 million judgment against Vincent for breach of its partnership contract.  The complaint alleges that the SEC found that Alliant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court improperly ordered Alliant to pay a $1,000,000 civil penalty against Vincent.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against all of the defendants, including Alliant, for their roles in the alleged fraudulent transfers.  Alliant has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $8,946,643 plus prejudgment interest of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, alliant has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the charged provisions, ordering it to disgorge $9,137,285.84 plus $1.1 million in punitive damages, and imposing a civil penalty of $1 million.   The SEC is continuing its investigation, which is continuing to be conducted by John Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Atlanta Office of Financial Regulation, and the Atlanta Field Office of the Office of Insurance Regulation."
