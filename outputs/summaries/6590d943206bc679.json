  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a California man accused of domestic violence in a previous case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, alleges that Christopher M. C.M., a seven-year-old boy, was unlawfully removed from his mother's home on January 7, 2017, on the basis of a conditional removal order issued by a court on January 6, 2017. The court found, by clear and convincing evidence, that K.K. had engaged in physical altercations with his mother and had destroyed her property. The Court also found that the order violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court had the authority to issue a temporary restraining order. The complaint also alleges that, in the first year of their marriage, the court issued a temporary injunction prohibiting K. K. from having any contact with the child, including with the mother, and ordered him to be immediately removed from the home and put back on calendar for a hearing on February 8. The order also requires the court to determine whether there is a substantial risk to the child's health, safety, or emotional well-being in the home.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Department for the Northern District of California today announced parallel criminal charges.  On March 3, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against C. M., alleging that he violated the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, C. m. and his mother, E.S., have agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal laws, orders them to comply with the court's orders, and imposes a $300,000 civil penalty against each of them. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for May 17, 2018, for the SEC to determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency, the California Department of Children and Family Services, and the Federal Office of Inspector General.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-0117 (January 17, 2013)."
