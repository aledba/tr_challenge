  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of Carnival Corporation in a civil injunctive action brought by Mirta Garcia, a cruise ship passenger who was injured while riding on an escalator to embark on her cruise.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, Garcia purchased a ticket to cruise on the M/V Carnival Cruise Line on November 7, 2013. The complaint alleges that Garcia was injured on the escalator and fell on the way to the United States Customs station.  The complaint further alleges that the cruise line failed to provide for the safe entry of business invitees on board the ship.  As alleged in the complaint, Garcia's injuries occurred during the disembarkation process, that is, during the act of unloading passengers from the ship, when the ship's escalator got stuck at the end of a moving walkway leading up to the port terminal.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Garcia had stopped her car in the front of the terminal to drop off her luggage before parking her car before she embarked on the cruise, and that she was injured when she fell from a car while leaving the port.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Carnival and the cruise company consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the \"savings to suitors\" provision of Section 1333 of the Exchange Act. The final judgments also order Carnival to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000,000 and a civil penalty of $1,500,000. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, the U.K. Secret Service, the British Columbia Securities Commission, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority and the Swiss Monetary Authority."
