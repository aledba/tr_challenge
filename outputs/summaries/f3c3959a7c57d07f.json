  "summary": "On August 9, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against a convicted sex offender who was sentenced to a minimum of 25 years to 100 years in prison.  The court found that Brian G. Appellant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that, as a result of his prior convictions, he was subject to mandatory minimum sentences as a repeat offender.  According to the court's order, in a parallel action, the Court issued a temporary restraining order and issued a preliminary injunction, which temporarily halted the pendency of the case.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued an order halting the sentencing proceedings.  On May 28, 2017, a federal district court in Pottstown, Montgomery County, entered an order suspending the sentencing and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty. The Court also issued a cease-and-desist order and ordered Appellerant to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the penalty imposed by the court.  Appellerand has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $2,078, and orders him be barred from serving any prison term for a period of five years.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Appelland has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, ordering him to disgorge $1,098, which includes prejudgment interest in the amount of $500,000 and a $1.5 million civil penalty for a second time, and requiring him to comply with a court order prohibiting him from associating with anyone with a prior criminal conviction. The order also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including in the purchase, sale, or promotion of a security deposit. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Timothy J. Burt. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The examination that led to the discovery of the alleged misconduct was conducted in the Office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of New Jersey. The investigation was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The trial will be conducted by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Cushman."
