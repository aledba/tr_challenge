  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Rafael Leoner-Aguirre, a former member of the Mara Salvatrucha gang in El Salvador, for RICO conspiracy.  The court previously found that Aguirre violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against him.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Aguirres agreed to a jury instruction that required him to show withdrawal from the conspiracy. The SEC alleges that, as a result of this instruction, he and his co-conspirators committed at least six murders, including one that he personally committed, and that he directly participated in three attempted murders. The complaint further alleges that the court failed to require the jury to make an affirmative finding, in the light of the evidence presented at trial, as to whether the defendant committed the two predicate acts of RICO, or whether he did commit the other two.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John C. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner, and the case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter, the Massachusetts Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office."
