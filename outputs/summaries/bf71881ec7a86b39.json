  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment in favor of a Minnesota man who was sentenced to a lifetime conditional-release following a jury trial.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Minneapolis, alleges that Anton Jermaine Brown violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the district court improperly granted a temporary restraining order against Brown, who was awaiting sentencing on unrelated criminal charges.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, from approximately 2:00 a.m. on June 2, 2017 to June 18, 2018, Brown and two of his co-defendants, E.C. and K.V., decided to sleep in an apartment building hallway after returning home from a three-day trial. The SEC alleges that defendants were afraid to go home because it was past their curfew, and the defendants found a ride back to the apartment. The court ultimately denied the defendants\u2019 requests for a second continuance.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver. The receiver has agreed to the appointment without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint. In its order appointing the receiver, the court also ordered that the receiver be accompanied by an attorney, a judge, and a probation officer. The order also requires the receiver to show sufficient evidence to determine whether the receiver has reasonable cause to believe that he or she has reasonable reason to believe he has a right to a speedy trial. In addition, the receiver must demonstrate that he has sufficient background in the field of child forensic interviewing to be able to determine the cause of a reasonable delay.  For further information, see the SEC's Complaint Bulletin on Child Abuse, Abuse of discretion, and Abuse of Trust.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Division of Criminal Justice's Office of Inspector General. The litigation will be led by Mr. Brown and Ms. O'Reilly. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Minnesota Attorney General's Office and the FBI in this matter."
