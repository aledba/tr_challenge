  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California against an immigration officer accused of defrauding his employer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that Ignacio Lanuza, a 38-year-old Mexican citizen who was originally detained for national security reasons and charged as a supporter of an officially listed terrorist organization, was not entitled to a Bivens remedy. Rather, the complaint alleges that he submitted forged documents in an attempt to obstruct the government\u2019s efforts to obtain a permanent resident status for his wife and children. The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the District Court entered a temporary restraining order on May 6, 2014, freezing the assets of the officer and ordering him to pay $12,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $13,000. The court also issued an order suspending the officer from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any immigration enforcement-related documents.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court found that the officer violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the officer consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, impose civil penalties, and bar him from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years. The order also prohibits him from associating with any third party in a case involving an enforcement action, including a federal district court, and from representing himself or others as an attorney or practicing professional in a public office. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case is being handled by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office.
