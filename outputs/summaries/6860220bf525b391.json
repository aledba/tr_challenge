  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against Denver-based furniture manufacturer Denver Mattress Co., LLC and its affiliated companies, Conoco, Inc. and Sofa Mart, LLC.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado on June 21, 2013, the defendants purchased large quantities of furniture at retail for resale or for their own use in advertising their products.  The complaint alleges that, like all the furniture they purchased, plaintiffs engaged in the business of resale and resale of the furniture.  As alleged in the complaint, plaintiffs purchased the furniture primarily as resale items, and thus those purchases were exempt from use tax.  In fact, the complaint alleges, plaintiffs never withdrew the displayed furniture from the showroom floor.  Instead, the court found, defendants simply did not depreciate any of the items for income tax, accounting, or financial reporting purposes.   The court also found that, when plaintiffs removed the furniture from their showroom floors, they were not required to change the furniture in its original or altered form and to give fair placement to some vendors\u2019 mattresses.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Additionally, Defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any securities in the United States, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Defendants also were ordered to pay $75,000 in civil penalties, which are subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Hirschfeld and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Denver Office of Financial Regulation, and the Colorado Office of Insurance Regulation."
