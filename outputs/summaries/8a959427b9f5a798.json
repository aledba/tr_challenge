  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against two former officers of the Massachusetts Sex Offender Registry Board for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, John Doe, a registered sex offender, came to Massachusetts in 2005 to attend school. He had previously been convicted in California for engaging in sexual relations with a sixteen year old when he was nineteen years old; California's age of consent was eighteen. The complaint alleges that, after learning that Massachusetts had preliminarily classified him as a level three offender, Doe immediately left Massachusetts, and SORB ceased publishing his name and criminal history on its Web site under the category entitled \"moved out of state.\" The complaint further alleges that the defendants did not receive due process at the time of publication, because the defendants' names and criminal histories were inaccurate.  The SEC's final judgment, which permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the federal securities laws, orders the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against John Doe. The SEC is continuing its investigation into the matter. The case is being supervised by Jennifer Chun Barry, Chief of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Amy Gwiazda and Ms. Barry. The court will consider the merits of the case.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 598, 600-603, 13 N.E.2d 206 (2014). The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. The Office of Compliance Counsel has also issued an Investor Alert on the subject of this matter, warning investors to be aware of the potential for misuse of investor funds.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Office of Inspector General today announced that it has obtained an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation of the matter, which is being conducted by Scott Frost and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Enforcement's Public Finance Abuse Unit. The receiver has agreed to the appointment of a receiver and to the payment of a civil penalty."
