  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Robinson, who was convicted of two counts of felony murder in the death of Michael Moore.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Robinson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court improperly allowed the State to show two body-camera videos to the jury.  According to the complaint, the jury deliberated for less than an hour before finding Robinson liable for the violations of the federal securities laws.  In its judgment, the court found that Robinson was liable for failing to show reasonable assistance of counsel in admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Robinson also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 24(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Exchange Act Section 10, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains with respect to his prior criminal convictions.   The court also ordered Robinson to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and ordered him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  To settle the SEC's case, Robinson will have to show that he was not deficient in his capacity as a trial counsel and that he is not prejudiced by the evidence presented to him by the trial court.  He also has agreed to be permanently enjoined from associating with any third party that may have contributed to his or her wrongful conviction.  On August 18, 2016, Robinson pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree murder in connection with Moore's death and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  A jury selection hearing was held on August 24, 2016.  Among other things, Robinson consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any securities in the United States, other than for the purpose of obtaining a temporary restraining order against Robinson from further violations of Rule 206(3) and 206 (4).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Robinson for the same conduct alleged in the SEC case.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 206 (1) (2) (a) (b) (c) (d) (e)"
