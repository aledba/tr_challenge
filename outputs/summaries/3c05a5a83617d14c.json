  "summary": "On August 5, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine entered a final judgment against Darryl Coskery, a former line cook and chef, in a civil injunctive action against the Social Security Administration (SSA) for denying his application for Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits and Supplemental Security Income.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Maine, alleges that, in assessing whether a claimant is disabled, the SSA required a Social Security Ruling (SSR) to determine whether a person has a \"residual functional capacity to perform light work.\" According to the complaint, in evaluating a claimant's disability, the SEC required that the claimant \"examine the entire case record, including the objective medical evidence; statements and other information provided by medical sources and other persons; and any other relevant evidence in the individual's case record.\" The complaint further alleges that the SEC's final judgment, on August 24, 2015, determined that, although Coskry suffered from a medical impairment, he retained a \u201cresidually functional capacity\u201d to perform a variety of daily activities, including caring for himself and a dog, maintaining his house, and grocery shopping, that indicated he had not used any illicit substances including marijuana since before the toxicology screenings. The complaint also alleges that in evaluating the claimant's \"credibility,\" the SEC requires that an ALJ evaluate the person's \"character or truthfulness,\" whether he has complied with treatment for the pain that the individual is suffering, and whether he is able to make an adjustment to other work. The SEC also requires that the ALJ consider the \"extent to which an individual's statements about symptoms can be relied upon as probative evidence in determining whether the individual has disabled.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed a parallel criminal case against Coskary. The case was investigated by the Office of Inspector General, which issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0assessment tool.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of using false claims about the severity of a person's impairment to identify whether they are disabled. \u00c2\u00a0In its investigation,\u00c2\u00a0the SEC obtained a court order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering the SEC to conduct an independent review of its findings.  In its order, the court found that, under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that a claimant was not disabled."
