  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment in favor of the individual defendants in a civil injunctive action against the Colorado state senatorial district.  The SEC's complaint, filed on April 23, 2017, alleges that, in 2016, Colorado voters approved Amendment 71, a ballot initiative that made it more difficult to place a state constitutional amendment on the state-wide ballot.  According to the complaint, the amendment required initiative proponents to collect signatures from at least two percent of the total number of registered voters in each state senate district, which is approximately equal in total population.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their signatures collected.  In addition, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment in their favor, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $1,000 and $2,500, respectively, for each of the defendants\u2019 alleged violations of Section 2.5 of the federal district court for the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Mascianica entered a judgment against the defendants, permanently enjoining them from future violations of the First and the Fourteenth Amendment, ordering them to comply with the court-ordered injunction, ordering the issuance of an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, and ordering the receiver to conduct a background check on the receiver.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the relief defendants, and imposing a $10,000 civil penalty against each of them. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Denver Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Justice's Public Finance Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Secretary of State's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
