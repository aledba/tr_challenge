  "summary": "On March 7, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the Board of Education of the New York City Department of Education (DOE) against I.M. Richburg, who was a member of the committee on special education.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan on May 16, 2005, Richburg and her husband, Lorraine Sesti, raised the issue of whether DOE violated the antifraud provisions of Section 504(a) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, in 2005, after learning that he required a \"mini-bus\" to transport him to and from school, I was placed on a full-sized school bus in accordance with his IEP.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the problem was not rectified until October 20, 2005.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Richburg for her role in this matter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 and $20,000, respectively, to be determined by the court at a later date.  On March 21, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered final judgments against the defendants, finding that the defendants violated the RA, the ADA, and the City and State HRLs.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Gabel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Alison Y. Tuitt. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the State Corporation Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FCRA), and the Department Of Education's Office of Pupil Transportation (OIEA)."
