  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of two men who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, on October 25, 2002, Eric Kemp was shot and killed by a group of men in the back of the shop.  According to the complaint, the defendants, James Fields and Ernest Williams, were playing pool and drinking at an electronics repair shop owned by Kemp when they were confronted by the men who demanded to know more about Kemp's past criminal history.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Fields and Williams believed that the prosecutor introduced facts not in evidence and shifted the burden of proof by waiting until closing argument to draw attention to the names of potential witnesses who were not called to testify.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Williams and Williams feared being arrested on drug charges, so they ran to their grandmother\u2019s house nearby and hid from the men.  On October 31, 2017, the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return to their respective homes to restock their arsenals and prepare for a hearing scheduled for November 5, 2017.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint or the facts of the case, Stephens and Williams have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and 17(a)(2) of Securities Act Section 10(b) and 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 13a-14 thereunder, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of up to $1,000,000.  Williams has agreed to settle the SEC case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any firearm, other than for the purpose of proving the element of prior conviction and admitting the evidence to the jury.  Davis has also agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  A hearing on November 6, 2017 was scheduled for 11:30 a.m. that same day, but the jury deliberated for less than an hour before finding that Stephens and McDowell violated Section 5(b).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Stephens"
