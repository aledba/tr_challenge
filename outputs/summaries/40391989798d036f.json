  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against defendant Alejandro Guzman for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 632(d) of the federal securities laws.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Guzman, ordering him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles on June 8, 2017, Guzman consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 632 and 632 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, and 14a-11 thereunder.  Guzman agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against him.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Lance W. and Glenn S. Gordon and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Office of the Attorney General."
