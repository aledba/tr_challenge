  "summary": "On July 18, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico entered a final judgment against defendant Anthony Cordova in a racketeering case.  The court found that A. Cordova violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and entered a judgment of acquittal against him.  According to the court's order, Cordova, a member of the Syndicato de Nuevo Mexico (\"SNM\"), acted as an \"associate with benefits\" with C. Garcia, a former SNM associate, to carry out the alleged scheme.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico today announced criminal charges against A.C. for his role in the SNM's recent activities in a prison riot that left twelve inmates dead and over 200 injured.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar.  A hearing is scheduled for August 21, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1275 (D.N.M. 2016).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Mexico Department of Corrections, and the New Mexican State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
