  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against Space Adventures, Ltd., a Virginia-based space travel company, for a $150,000 investment fraud.  The SEC's complaint, filed on May 11, 2010, alleges that Harold McPike, a wealthy Austrian adventurer seeking to be a space tourist, entered into a contract with Space Adventures for a spaceflight around the moon and to the International Space Station.  According to the complaint, the agreement provided that plaintiff would pay a non-refundable $7,000,000 deposit over the course of three installments and thereafter to make additional payments of $120,000 and $140,000.  In reality, the contract did not permit plaintiff to complete the spaceflight.  Instead, plaintiff sought a refund of his initial $7k,000 deposited deposit and, in 2014, SA terminated the agreement, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, plaintiff's fraud in the inducement and consumer fraud claims are time-barred by Virginia's two-year statute of limitations.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that SA failed to disclose to plaintiff that it had not consulted with Roscosmos about the circumlunar space mission and had no contractual relationship with the Russian space agency.  Rather, the SEC alleges that the defendants simply mishandled the plaintiff's money and did not have the capacity to fulfill the obligations of the agreement.   The complaint also alleges that, in a parallel action, the Virginia Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, charging them with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Finally, the court granted a temporary restraining order against the Defendants from further violations of the federal securities laws, and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.5 million.  On May 24, 2015, the date that SA terminated its agreement, plaintiff made his first installment payment toward the $30,000 dollar deposit that was due, and he lost his initial deposit.  At the same time, on July 25, 2016, the Court granted the defendants' request for a preliminary injunction, ordered the Defendants to disgorge their allegedly fraudulent claims, and issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the receivers"
