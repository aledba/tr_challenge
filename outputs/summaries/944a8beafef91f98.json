  "summary": "On March 15, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Indiana entered final judgments against the building corporation and three of its tenants in an ongoing tax case.  The court's order, which was entered on February 23, 2018, permanently enjoins the Building Corporation from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $11.3 million.  In a parallel action, the Indiana Board of Health today announced that it has issued an order finding that Epworth Crossing, a medical building located in Newburgh, Indiana, is entitled to a charitable purposes exemption under Section 6 of the Exchange Act.  According to the order, the building company and three tenants agreed to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions, and ordering them to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the Building Corp. and the three tenants consented to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Additionally, the court granted the Building corporation's request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against further violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The Court's order also prohibits the construction of any building or building that is not subject to the exemption, and prohibits the purchase, sale, or alteration of any existing building.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-20-17 (January 24, 2019).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L.
