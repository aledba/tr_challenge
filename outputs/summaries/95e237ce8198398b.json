  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri on March 21, 2017, entered a final judgment against Christopher L. Elder, a Texas resident, that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that Elder violated the federal registration provisions of Sections 9124(a)(1), (b)(3) and (4) and of the Medical Practice Act of 1985 and Rules 10b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Elder was a \"minimal participant\" in the conspiracy that ultimately resulted in his suspension of his medical license in 2010.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Elder.  Among other things, the SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Celious Barner III, Cynthia St. Martin, Troy R. Solomon, and Delmon L. Johnson of the Philadelphia Regional Office, with the assistance of the Office of Inspector General's Market Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect patterns of suspicious activity. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by John R. Ake and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.   The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
