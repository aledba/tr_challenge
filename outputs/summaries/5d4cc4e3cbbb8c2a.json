  "summary": "On October 25, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Cincinnati Reds, L.L.C., a team owned and controlled by the Reds, that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Cincinnati, alleges that the Reds violated Section 5739.01(B)(3)(d) and Rule 5739-01(E) and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty against the Reds.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the SEC's continuing investigation, which is continuing, the Reds have not provided any evidence to support its claims that they are liable for use tax on the promotional items sold to fans.  For example, the complaint alleges that, in the 1940s and 1950s, when the Reds were the first major league team to offer tickets to a game, they provided tickets to the game with the understanding that the tickets would be resold at a later date. The complaint further alleges that in addition to providing tickets to games that would otherwise be attended by fewer fans, they also provided the opportunity to receive unique merchandise, such as bobbleheads, shirts, blankets, caps, player cards, tote bags, magnetic schedules, photographs, and bats, that can be obtained only by attending a game.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future. The final judgments also order the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $25,000, $10,000 and $1,500, respectively, for violations of Section 5(a) and 5(c) and (c) thereunder of the sales-for-resale provisions of Sections 5739 and 5739 of the Retail Act of 1940. The settlements are subject to court approval. The litigation will be led by Richard Sandomir. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Attorney General's Office in this matter."
