  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Noe S. (Noe), a 10-month-old daughter of a Compton Varrio Segundo gang member, was unlawfully placed in the home of a nonoffending parent who was incarcerated for two counts of attempted murder.  According to the complaint, Noe was not able to care for Noe because Mother was incarcerated and failed to make arrangements for the child's care.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Noe.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains with respect to Noe's release.  On November 29, 2011, the court granted Father custody of Noe, and ordered Noe to be placed with his mother, Griselda S., who lives at the time of the alleged misconduct.  After the court's order granted Noe custody, Mother was placed with her aunt Julia M. (Noe) or a paternal aunt and uncle, Irene and David L., who live in the same home.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, no one was harmed in the alleged conduct, and the court found Noe not at risk of harm to the child, and placed him with a parent who is incarcerated and unable to provide for the care of the child.   The court also found that the incarcerated parent had a history of substance abuse and mental health issues, and that she was unable to make appropriate care arrangements for her child and the length of that parent's incarceration.  At the jurisdictional hearing, the judge found that no reasonable means of protecting Noe from harm were available to remove him from the home, and issued a temporary restraining order requiring the court to determine whether or not to place Noe with a custodian. The court ordered the custodian to cooperate with family maintenance services, to enroll in a parenting program, and to go to a gang diversion program. The judge granted the order without prejudice to the individual who was found liable for the violations of Section 300 of the Exchange Act, and appointed a receiver to determine the appropriate placement.
