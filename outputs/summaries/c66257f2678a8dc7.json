  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment against a Nebraska State Patrol investigator who conducted an online undercover investigation for child enticement.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Omaha, Nebraska, alleges that Nicholas Frederick, a former state trooper who conducted the undercover investigation, used an e-mail to chat with a 14-year-old girl who claimed to be his daughter.  According to the complaint, the conversation was recorded on a cell phone and the message was sent through the encrypted messaging application Signal. The complaint further alleges that Thomas used the encrypted communications to communicate with the girl, who he believed was his daughter, and to solicit her to perform oral sex on him.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Thomas.  To settle the SEC's charges, Thomas agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 28-833 of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Thomas consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions, ordering him to disgorge, prejudge, and pay civil penalties equal to his pre-judgment judgment, and requiring him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Thomas also agreed to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the conduct of his or her employer.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-0221.  This case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Nebraska Department of Justice, and the Nebraska State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
