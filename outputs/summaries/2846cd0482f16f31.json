  "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has obtained a final judgment ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, from 2008 to 2016, James H. Brennan and Douglas A. Dyer owned and managed Broad Street Ventures, LLC. The complaint alleges that Brennan and Dyer induced investment in Scenic City by claiming that the company was appropriately capitalized and would use the proceeds to acquire small private businesses. Instead, they allegedly diverted a significant portion of the funds to themselves as nontaxable distributions and underreported their income to evade paying taxes on it. According to the complaint, the SEC's final judgment, on August 1, 2017, permanently enjoins Brennan from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Brennan to pay a civil penalty of $184,022.84 and $354,251.58, respectively, in the amount of $4,942,070.18, for the years 2010 through 2014. For the years 2014, Dyer owed an additional $312,799 in taxes and Brennan owed $164,542.18. In total, the complaint alleged that investors lost $4.942 million between 2010 and 2016.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against both defendants. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(b)(2)(A), and a penalty ranging from $1,000 to $2,500,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations, and order them to pay disgorgements of $3,943,070, which is equal to the amount they received in the civil case. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the New York federal district court entered a temporary restraining order against Brennan. The court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, ordered Brennan to disgorge $1.9 million, and ordered Dyer to pay $2.5 million in restitution. The final judgment also prohibits Brennan from participating in securities law enforcement activities and from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlements are pending final approval by the court."
