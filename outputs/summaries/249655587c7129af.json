  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming today entered a final judgment against Caleb Dwight Bazzle, a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for violating the terms of his probation.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, on December 15, 2015, the District Court entered a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder, and orders him to pay a penalty of three to five years of supervised release.  The court also ordered him to submit a \"transaction plan\" to determine whether to revoke his probation and impose a five-year suspended sentence.  In its order, the court found that, in the event of a successful completion of the probation, the defendant could not participate in the treatment court program.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the judge granted the court's order and ordered the defendant to comply with the court\u2019s order.  On January 26, 2016, the district court held a hearing on the merits of the case against the defendant, finding that he had violated the probation provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and that he was entitled to a partial right to reapply after six months of probation revocation.  It also found that the defendant had not complied with the probation provision of Section 5(b)(5) and (c) the pre-judgment provision of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Bizzle.
