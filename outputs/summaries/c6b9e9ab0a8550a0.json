  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jaime Melgar, her husband of thirty-two years, ordering her to pay a civil penalty of twenty-seven years.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least the morning of the murder, Jaime and her husband, Jaime Melgars, engaged in a series of unprovoked physical and verbal assaults on their home. The complaint alleges that the defendants used a combination of tools and other materials to commit the attack, including a dry cleaning bag, a chair, and a tupperware container. According to the complaint, the defendants tied themselves up in the master bedroom and master bathroom, and then staged the scene to resemble a home invasion gone wrong. The SEC also alleges that Jaime's brother and sister-in-law, who were also present at the time of the alleged assault, entered the home to check on the victims and found that Jaime had been restrained by a home invader, who had been in the house the night before. The court found that the jury had a reasonable basis for concluding that Jaime was the person who attacked her husband and that she intentionally or knowingly caused his death.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Jaime.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Jaime, charging her with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  A hearing on May 4, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. EST. The case was being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Criminal Division of the New York Regional Office, and was supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Office of Inspector General, and the U.N. Secret Service in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 569 S.W.3d 592, 608 (Tex. Crim. App. 2018)."
