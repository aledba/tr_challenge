  "summary": "On April 20, 2018, a jury convicted Defendant Donald Martin of attempting to entice a person under the age of eighteen years to engage in sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20192422(b) and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The court also found that Martin was not liable for the conduct of the alleged entrapment.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court for the Southern District of New York, Martin raised the issue of whether or not the government could prove the defendant's state of mind based solely on the evidence presented at trial.  Martin's complaint alleges that the jury instruction, which was provided to the court in writing by the jury foreman during deliberations, failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not entrapped.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Martin, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Martin consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,500. Martin also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be restrained from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the conduct alleged in the SEC complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Kentucky Department of Justice in this matter."
