  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Freeman Expositions, Inc. and its insurance carrier, Old Republic Insurance Company, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Omaha, Nebraska, alleges that the compensation court erred in finding that weyerman had not yet reached maximum medical improvement (MMI) when he was injured on September 17, 2015.  According to the complaint, Weyerman was injured in a work accident on October 9, 2015 and was unable to perform his work duties.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the Compensation Court improperly found that Freeman and Old Republic were liable as a party on the date of the alleged injury, and that the company was entitled to continuing temporary total disability payments in the amount of $376.71 per week.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Nebraska today announced criminal charges against Weyman.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered an order permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively.   The court's order also ordered that the defendants pay a $1.5 million civil penalty, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Nebraska Department of Health, and the Nebraska State Department of Insurance."
