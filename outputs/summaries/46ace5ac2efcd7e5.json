  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment against New Jersey law violators of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey on May 9, 2018, alleges that New Jersey passed a federal law that imposes a mandatory minimum of ten rounds of ammunition (LCM) on law-abiding citizens.  According to the complaint, the federal law prohibits the purchase, sale, or sale of any type of firearm, including semi-automatic,.45-caliber, and.38-caliber. The SEC alleges that, in addition to imposing the LCM ban, the state also prohibits the sale, purchase, or registration of any firearm.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the proposed law does not require gun owners to surrender their magazines but instead allows them to retain modified magazines or register firearms that have magazines that cannot be modified.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The court also granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, which is pending final approval by the court.  On May 10, 2019, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans of the United States District Court in Newark granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 24, 2019).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the New Jersey Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the U.N. Secret Service, and the FBI in this matter."
