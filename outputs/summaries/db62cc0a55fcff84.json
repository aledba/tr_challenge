  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Katlyn Bales, a Scott County, Arkansas, mother of two children who were allegedly removed from their home due to medical neglect.  The SEC's complaint, filed on September 13, 2017, alleges that Bales violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Bales consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations.  Bales also agreed to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or promotion of any order requiring her to relinquish custody of the children.  In its order, the court also ordered Bales to pay a civil penalty of $5,000, and ordered her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500.  Without admitting to the allegations in the complaint or denying Bales's allegations, Bals agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to return to her home state of Oklahoma to live with her husband and two children, and requires her to comply with the court's order appointing a dependency-neglect adjudicator.  On September 20, the SEC filed an emergency court order against Bales for her violations of Section 9(a)(1)(A) and Rule 9(b)(5)(B) thereunder, ordering her to surrender her passport and to pay civil penalties of $500,000 and $1,500, respectively, for her participation in the alleged violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder and ordering her return to the home state where she resides.  She has agreed to the issuance of an order permanently barring her from serving or participating in any officer-and-director program, including the appointment of a Child Abuse Unit (CSA) that is designed to detect and detect signs of child abuse and to prevent such violations.  A hearing on September 24, 2017 was scheduled for 7:00 p.m. for Bales and the CSA to determine whether to issue an order imposing a temporary restraining order against her from violating the charged provisions of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Rules of Conduct, and to consent to a hearing concerning the children's health and safety that is subject to court approval."
