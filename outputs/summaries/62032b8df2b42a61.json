  "summary": "On February 28, 2019, the Pennsylvania Department of State Board of Medicine issued an order to expedite an administrative proceeding against a Pennsylvania-based surgeon who was found incompetent in performing an emergency surgery.  According to the order, on December 28, 2012, a patient at Ephrata Community Hospital in Philadelphia was admitted to the hospital in the presence of an anesthesiologist who was unable to stop the bleeding.  The order, which was issued without admitting or denying the Board's findings, required that Dr. Ives undergo a clinical competency skills assessment and provide an expert opinion on whether or not to perform the surgery in violation of the accepted standard of care.  In addition, the order required that the surgeon perform a self-assessment of the patient's health and well-being, including whether she was stable, whether she had developed a blood clot, and whether there was sufficient blood to remove the tumor from her body.   The Board's order also requires that the surgery be performed in accordance with the accepted standards of care for a surgeon.  On March 20, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against the surgeon, ordering him to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the surgeon to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the court granted the surgeon's request for a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Christopher Connolly and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office of Health and Human Services in this matter."
