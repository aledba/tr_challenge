  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Alaska today announced criminal charges against an Indian custodian accused of defrauding a child welfare agency.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Anchorage, Alaska, alleges that, from October 2012 through January 2013, Rafael H., a maternal uncle who was placed in the care of two Indian children, was not given the mandatory ICWA notices and related advisements required for Indian custodianship.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Rafael did not participate as a party in the selection and placement of the minors.  According to the complaint, as a result of this conduct, Rafael was not entitled to the required ICWA notice and was not permitted to participate in the placement or removal of the children as required by the federal law.  As a result, Rafael is not eligible to be placed in long-term foster care as required under the ICWA.  Instead, the SEC alleges, Rafael has been deprived of the requisite ICWA information and the ability to determine whether or how to proceed with the placement of a child under his care.

On January 16, 2013, the court issued a temporary restraining order halting Rafael from participating in any involuntary child welfare proceeding.  A hearing on February 19, 2013 was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. that same day.  After the hearing, the hearing was adjourned until at least ten days after the hearing to consider whether or not to issue an order requiring Rafael to consent to the issuance of the restraining order.  At that time, the juvenile court issued an order suspending Rafael from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Following the September 2013 court order, the agency issued a cease and desist order, ordering Rafael to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of possible child abuse and related issues, and ordering a hearing on January 24, 2013.  Finally, on February 26, 2013 the court ordered Rafael to"
