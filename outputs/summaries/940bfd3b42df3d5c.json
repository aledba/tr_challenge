  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that defendant Ahmed Salim Faraj Abu Khatallah violated Section 924 of the federal criminal code.  According to the complaint, the court found that, for the purposes of determining whether a defendant could be convicted of a crime of violence under the federal securities laws, the defendant had to prove that he had used or threatened to use physical force against the person or property of another.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in light of the recent U.K. Supreme Court decision in Sessions v. Dimaya, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, the jury in this case was not required to show that a defendant had used, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force in the course of committing the crime.  Instead, it found that the defendant could have waived his \"crime of violence\" by not objecting to the jury instruction that \"[t]he crimes charged in Counts One through Seventeen are crimes of violence.\"  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of Sections 924(c) and (e)10(b)(3)(A) and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  Finally, the Court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the amount of their losses.  On November 28, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the government's request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 923(c).  The court's order also temporarily suspended the asset freeze pending final approval of the final judgment.   The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United Kingdom Secret Service in this matter."
