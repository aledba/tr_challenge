  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of Series AGI West Linn Limited Partnership, LLC, a California-based company that lent $3.1 million to a financial institution for the development of a \"commercial marketplace.\"  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, Eves signed a \"Guaranty of Loan Addendum\" in April 2007, which included a provision that expressly specified that proceeds from the sale of an excluded asset would be included in the guaranty.  The complaint alleges that Eves failed to include the provision in his guaranty, and that he failed to add it to the document.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Economic and Risk Analysis (OIEA) today announced that it has issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order, freezing Eves's assets, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $6.3 million, prejudgment interest of $2.4 million, and attorney fees of $1.2 million.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Series and Eves consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively.  Eves also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and ordered to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  He has also agreed not to participate in the issuance of an OIEA, which is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Eves, charging him with violations of Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 15a-3 of the Exchange Act and Rules 15b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Robert Wadley and supervised by Marc Blau of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Wadley. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Financial Regulation, and the California Department of Banking and Securities."
