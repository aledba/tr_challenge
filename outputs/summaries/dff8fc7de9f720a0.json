  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against four defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by a federal court in Brooklyn, New York.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, from January through October 2012, defendant Chamma Brandon, a Christian inmate at the Clinton County Jail, was denied meals containing pork in violation of his religious diet.  According to the complaint, Brandon alleges that he was served pork in his meals on at least 10 occasions, and that, after being informed of his dietary restrictions, he continued to be served pork despite being told that he could not eat the pork.  As alleged, however, the defendants did not inform the kitchen of Brandon\u2019s dietary restrictions until several months after he complained about being served pork, which the court held was not a substantial burden on his religious beliefs.  In a parallel action, on December 25, 2012, a federal district court in New York entered a judgment against the defendants, finding that Brandon violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against Brandon.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Brandon consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On December 26, Brandon filed a second complaint, this time alleging that, on November 5, he received pork in a meatless salad while other Muslim inmates had pork in their meals.  He also alleges that on November 17, when he asked for a grievance, he was not served pork on that date.  Finally, on October 5, after receiving a letter from the kitchen informing him that pork was not pork, Brandon allegedly complained to one of the inmates and asked him to remove the pork from his meal.   The complaint further alleges that the next day, shortly after receiving the letter, another inmate confronted Brandon about his pork-related complaints and told him that he would rather not eat pork than hear him complain about it.  Brandon allegedly replied, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you grieve this, since you want to eat pork.\u201d  The court found that, despite these representations, Brandon continued to receive pork in the meals even after being told by another inmate that he did not want pork in those meals, despite having asked the kitchen to remove it from the menu.  Additionally, the court ruled that, based on the defendants\u2019 statements, Brandon"
