  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against Brian Flaggs, a former employee of ABC Student Transportation, for his role in an October 28, 2016 shooting that left three men injured.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit on May 9, 2016, Flagg was involved in an argument with his former girlfriend, TJ Pritchett, which led to a high-speed car chase. The complaint alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, defendant got out of his car and began shooting at the two men, who were standing behind the car. As alleged, after hearing the first shot, defendant turned and fired at the men, causing the men to run out of the car and into the street. The SEC alleges that defendant then fired two additional shots at the three men, which were not aimed at him.  The SEC further alleges that Flagg's attorneys failed to show sufficient evidence to prove that defendant had the requisite intent to commit murder when he fired the second shot.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Flagg.  On May 10, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer and director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investigational\u00c2\u00a0adviser.gov.
