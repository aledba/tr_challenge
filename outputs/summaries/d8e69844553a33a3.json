  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil action brought by the New York Attorney General's Office against Quicken Loans, Inc.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that Quicken and its owner, John J. Kassner, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In its order, the court also granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the companies, and ordering the receivership of the loans.  According to the court's order, which was entered on May 31, 2013, the parties agreed to a six-year statute of limitations that would permit them to cure or repurchase the non-conforming loans at a later date.  As alleged in the complaint, the settlement is untimely because the parties failed to comply with the representations and warranties in the contract.   The court also found that the parties violated the anti-fraud provision of Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and ordered the receiver to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver.  On June 1, 2014, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Manhattan charging Quicken with violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5a-3 thereunder and seeking a permanent injunction.  Quicken has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions, ordering him to pay civil penalties of $10,000 and $20,000, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  Separately, in a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for Manhattan today announced criminal charges against Kassner for his role in the alleged scheme.  This case is being handled by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, under the supervision of Eric R. Werner, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Department of Justice in this matter."
