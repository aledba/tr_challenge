  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered final judgments against Meemic Insurance Company, Inc., a Michigan-based insurance company, and its principal, Justin Fortson, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint alleges that from 2009 until 2015, Justin and Louise Fortson provided attendant care to their 19-year-old son, Justin. According to the complaint, Justin suffered extensive injuries, including a fractured skull, a traumatic brain injury, and shoulder bruising. The complaint also alleges that Louise and Richard provided maintenance services to Justin while he was incarcerated or at inpatient substance-abuse rehabilitation facilities. The SEC alleges that Justin had been periodically jailed for traffic and drug offenses and had spent time at an inpatient rehabilitation facility. In addition, on social media, Justin had reported spending time with his girlfriend and smoking marijuana. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Justin.  In its order granting summary disposition, the court also ordered Meemic to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $500,000 civil penalty. The court also issued a temporary restraining order against Justin and Meemic from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay $1,500 in civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 24, 2019).  The case is being handled by Michael Bazzi, Kelly L. Gibson, and Amy C. Barry of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Insurance, and the Michigan Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
