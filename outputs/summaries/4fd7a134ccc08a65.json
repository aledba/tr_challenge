  "summary": "On September 6, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in Jackson County, Alabama, ordering Jackson County to show cause why it should not be held in contempt for violating the discharge order issued by the court on July 8, 2019.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Jackson County paid $44,889.82 to settle a debt owed to Jackson County for solid waste collection services.  According to the complaint, the debt owed by the Debtors was an unsecured debt for which Jackson County had no obligation to collect the debt.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the debt was excepted from discharge pursuant to a state court order that imposed a $1,000 civil penalty against Jackson County.  Jackson County has a right to collect a debt without a court-ordered discharge order.  As alleged in the SEC's brief, however, Jackson County is not entitled to a civil penalty for its failure to pay the prepetition debt and the discharge injunction bars it from collecting the debt as a personal liability under the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins Jackson County from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 523(a)(7) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder. The final judgment also prohibits the District Attorney's Office from issuing or enforcing any civil injunctive action against the debtors, and from imposing any civil penalty or penalty on the debt subject to court approval.  Additionally, the court has issued an order suspending the issuance of a cease-and-desist order and imposing a civil injunction.  On September 25, 2019 the court entered an Order suspending Jackson County's discharge from collection of delinquent debt, which was subject to a court order requiring the district attorney to issue a judgment imposing civil injunctions.  It also issued an Order appointing an enforcement officer to assist Jackson County with its collection and disposal of delinquent debts.  Finally, the Court entered an order appointing an officer and director of the Jackson County Solid Waste Department to provide an accounting of the debt's discharge and to determine whether it was eligible for a civil monetary penalty or forfeiture.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the issuance or issuance of any civil monetary order, from making any judgments concerning the discharge of debts, including those that are subject to Court approval."
