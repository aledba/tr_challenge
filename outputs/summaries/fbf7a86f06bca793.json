  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two former officers of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for their roles in a long-running drug-trafficking scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that James Marvin Hawkins and Wallace Eugene McCree violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Hawkins and McCree agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced criminal charges against Hawkins, McCree, and others in connection with the alleged drug ring.  On May 23, 2015, a federal judge found Hawkins guilty on all three counts of the drug ring, ordering him to pay $299,920 in restitution, and ordering McCree to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  McCree pleaded guilty on the same day to one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and was sentenced to a total of 170 months in prison and a five-year officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting to the SEC's findings, Hawkins, McCluskey, and McDowell consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively.  McDowell also agreed to be barred from appearing as an attorney or practicing before the SEC as a result of his prior convictions.   The court's order against McCree also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any electronic device, including cell phones, without a court order requiring him to do so, and requires him to show that he has expertise, as well as knowledge beyond that available to the jury.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 565 F.3d at 1336.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court against Hawkins on May 24, 2014, charging McCree with violating Section 565 of the Exchange Act and Rules 5a-5 and 5c-8 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting McCree\u2019s violations of Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 15a-1 and Rule 15b2-3 thereunder; and against McDowell for violating Exchange Act Section"
