The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Pender County, North Carolina, alleges that, in 2005, Frieze, Ganer, and another manager of the company, Steven Silverman, violated Rule 41(a)(1) by failing to timely respond to requests for an emergency court order granting a temporary restraining order against Ganer and Silverman from violating the two-dismissal rule.
