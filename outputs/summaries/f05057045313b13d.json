  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of two counts of murder in the first degree and unlawful possession of a firearm in the second degree.  According to the SEC's complaint, on March 22, 2003, Quirico Romero was fatally shot at a baby shower. The SEC alleges that, in the course of the trial, counsel failed to call a witness who corroborated the defendant's account of the event. The complaint further alleges that the witness, who was not named in the complaint, was not present at the baby shower when the shooting took place. The court found that, although successor counsel was aware of the witness's testimony, she did not call him. Instead, the complaint alleges, the witness told the defendant that he had been inside a building with the defendant when the event took place, and that the defendant had been outside the hall with the guest when the alleged assailant shot him.  The complaint alleges that when the defendant confronted the witness about the shooting, he shot the witness in the back and later died of his injuries.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Mr. Brunson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Massachusetts Office of Criminal Investigations."
