  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Raytheon International, Inc. (\"Raytheon\") and Electronics Corp. of America (\"E.C.A.\").  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that, at the time it applied for abatement of the 2016 deficiency assessment on its 2007 and 2012 returns, the commissioner had abated the deficiency assessment in full on the same day it filed its 2012 return.  According to the complaint, RayTheon's application was filed well within the two-year limit established by G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 37, and fell within three years after the date it filed the return. The complaint further alleges that Raythetheon failed to timely respond to the commissioner's denial of the deficiency assessments.  In its amended and restated petition, filed on December 5, 2016, the SEC alleges that the commissioner abated all of the deficiencies assessed and paid with its original returns, including the amount of any overpayment, when it had not done so.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Commissioner of Revenue has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the company to pay a civil penalty of $2,737,091, plus interest and penalties, of $119,929.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  RayThe SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Compliance and Assessments with the assistance of the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force. The litigation will be led by Mr. Chesterton and Ms. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling or offering them investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance and cooperation of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
