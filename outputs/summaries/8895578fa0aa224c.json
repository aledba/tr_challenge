  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Michael Paige Palmer, who was sentenced to 97 months in prison for distributing child pornography.  According to the SEC's complaint, on January 17, 2018, a grand jury indicted Palmer for transporting and possessing child pornography, and sentenced him to 97 years in prison.  The complaint alleges that, for the purposes of calculating his sentencing range, the district court improperly grouped the offenses together before separately calculating the adjusted offense level for each of Palmer\u2019s offenses.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants used an application to distribute at least four child-pornography files to another user, who also had a prior conviction for possession of child pornography for the same conduct.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Palmer, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Palmer consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a penalty of 97 months, and requires him to be barred from the securities industry for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New Jersey Office of Inspector General."
