  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a school district that previously barred transgender students from using the school's restrooms and locker rooms.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on May 24, 2017, the Boyertown Area School District (BASH) and its principal, Dr. E. Wayne Foley, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that the school district's policy and practice of allowing transgender students to use the restrooms or locker rooms consistent with their gender identity was inconsistent with the district's practice.  For example, according to the complaint, Joel Doe, a junior at BASH, was in the locker room changing in the morning when he observed a member of the opposite sex changing with him in the bathroom.  As alleged in the complaint:  Joel Doe was in his underwear when he saw the person changing with her.  He immediately took off his clothes and put on his gym shorts and a pair of boxer shorts.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the district has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws, orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the district to pay civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 26, 2016, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in New York City, alleging that the BASH school district violated the anti-bullying provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(c), and 13(b)(2)(A), and that the district violated Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The SEC also charged the principal of BASH with aiding and abetting the violations of Section 15(e) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  It also charged Foley as an unregistered broker of securities in connection with the alleged violations of the securities laws.  Finally, the complaint charges Foley with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act for his role in the scheme of the same-sex trading scheme that led to the suspension of two BASH students.  To settle the case, the court granted the district a temporary restraining order and ordered Foley to return to his duties as school district attorney. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John F. Connolly, Kelly L. Gibson, and Patrick J. McCluskey of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Foley and Ms. Gibson."
