  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was barred by the federal securities laws from filing a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed on May 26, 2017, alleges that defendant John Dennis Hastert violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from 1973 through 1974, plaintiff was riding his bike along Game Farm Road when he was confronted by a man who threatened to charge him with a crime and accused him of slandering his mother and family members.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that, while plaintiff was in a bathroom stall, defendant entered the stall, bent plaintiff over the toilet, and threatened to kick him out of the building.   The complaint further alleges that the plaintiff did not know of the alleged abuse until he reached the age of 18, and that he did not tell his mother or father about the alleged misconduct until after he had turned 18.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hattert.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.N. Office for Children and Families, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
