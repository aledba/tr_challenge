  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Avicanna Inc., a Canadian company that contracted with St. J Distribution LLC to purchase certain assets in Ontario, Canada.  According to the SEC's order, filed in federal court in Colorado on June 23, 2009, Avicannica Inc. (\"Avicanna\") and Laughing Dog Group, LLC (\"Laughing Dog\") agreed to settle a civil action brought by a Canadian citizen who claimed that he or she was the sole beneficiary of a forum selection clause.  The court also found that Avicna violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that, as a result of the defendants\u2019 delay in raising the forum selection provision, they could not unilaterally waive it.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by failing to show sufficient evidence to show that they were the sole beneficiaries of the provision.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s order, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,038,767, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Division of Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado Office of Financial Regulation."
