  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Lifetouch, Inc., a now-defunct professional photography company, and its former CEO, Paul Harmel, for fraudulently overvaluing the company's stock in 2015 and 2016. According to the SEC's amended complaint, filed in federal district court in Streambend, New York, the Trustee Defendants breached their duty of prudence by failing to adequately investigate and remedy the overvaluation and to remediate the underlying causes of the alleged misconduct. The amended complaint alleges that the Trustees violated their fiduciary duty to the Plan and to the independent appraiser, and that they violated their duty to monitor and remove imprudent investments when they did not do so. In addition, the amended Complaint alleges that, by over valuing the stock when the company was struggling to adapt to technological changes and evolving consumer demands, Defendants breached the duty to invest in the Plan.  The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court in Manhattan, charges the Truste Defendants with violating Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 12(b)(6) thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  In a parallel action, the U.N.
