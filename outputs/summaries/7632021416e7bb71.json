  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Idaho today entered a preliminary injunction against Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest and the Hawaiian Islands' (Planned Parenthood) motion for a final judgment against the state that enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder, and orders the company to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boise, Idaho, alleges that the federal district court for the southern district of Idaho issued an order halting the implementation of the federal anti-fraud law.  In its order, the court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the company's assets, and ordering it to submit a written report to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (IDHW) concerning any direct or indirect complications stemming from an abortion.  According to the SEC's order, filed on July 1, 2018, Idaho passed a law that requires all medical providers who perform abortions to file a report with the IDHW concerning any adverse medical condition related to an abortion, and requires that all providers report any complications arising from the abortion. The order also requires that providers and their doctors report any complication that arose from the termination of an abortion when there is no reasonable basis for that complication to be reported.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Planned Parenthood has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions, ordering that the company pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against the company.  Planned Parenthood's motion for preliminary injunction is pending final approval by the court.  On June 14, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court in Idaho, charging Planned Parenthood with violating the federal securities laws. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  A hearing on June 21, 2019 will be held on the matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1708.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Idaho Attorney General's Office, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, and the Idaho Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
