  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Gilbert H. Hyatt II, a California resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Nevada, Hyatt claimed that the United States had a right to sovereign immunity under the federal securities laws, and that, as a result of his filing of his tax returns, he was entitled to the same immunity as other States.  The complaint alleges that, in 1992, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California (\"DOJ\") filed an audit to determine whether Hyatt underpaid his 1991 and 1992 state income taxes by misrepresenting his residency and the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice.  In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) today announced that it has obtained a court order halting an ongoing investigation into Hyatt\u2019s alleged violations of the DoJ. The SEC previously issued an order halting the investigation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC has agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins Hyatt from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Office of Tax Appeals, which has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint on the subject of this matter.\u00c2\u00a0In its Complaint, the Commission on International Affairs (OIEA) and the Office of the Secretary of State's Office (DOJ) have issued\u00c2\u00a0Significant\u00c2\u00a0Assumptions\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0Advisers to Investors in\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0the United States is immune from liability for all injuries caused by its tax collection.  OIEA has also issued an Investor Alert in which\u00c2\u00a0it\u00c2\u00a0warns investors that\u00c2\u00a0investors should\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of any SEC case that may be filed with the agency.
