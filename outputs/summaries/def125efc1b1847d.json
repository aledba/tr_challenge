  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Tugaw Ranches, LLC, a cattle ranching operation based in Oakley, Idaho, for violating the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on November 29, 2018, filed in federal district court in the District of Columbia, the defendants misrepresented to the court that they had jurisdiction to review any agency's compliance with the federal rules.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the federal agencies were not subject to judicial review because they failed to submit the proposed rule amendments to Congress.  In addition, as alleged in the complaint, the court found that the agency's failure to submit its proposed rule violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  Additionally, the judgment orders the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires the agency to submit a written response to Congress for review.   The court's order also prohibits the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuers' issuers of the securities, and prohibits the agency from issuing or selling any security.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, or No. 17-cv-01221. \u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Missouri today announced criminal charges against the defendants arising from the same conduct alleged by the complaint.  This case is being handled by Paul J. Larkin, Jr. and Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Fort Worth Regional Office."
