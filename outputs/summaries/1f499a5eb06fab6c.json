  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against John Michael Fowler, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 40 years in prison for the production and possession of child pornography.  The court found that Fowler violated the antifraud provisions of Section 3553 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 3553 thereunder.  According to the court's order, filed on October 15, 2018, Fowler was sentenced on a felony count of disseminating child pornography, which is a form of \"good-time credits\" that are required for a defendant to be sentenced to a minimum of 40 years of imprisonment.  As alleged in the complaint, the judge failed to consider the potential impact of good-time credit when sentencing Fowler, who was then living with his girlfriend at the time, and Jane, who is now diagnosed with chlamydia, a sexually transmitted disease, had recently been treated for, among other things, a long-term commitment to treatment and supervision.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Fowler arising from the same conduct.  To learn more about good time credits, see Litigation Release Bulletin No. 3553 (4th Cir. 2014).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, charges Fowler with violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Fowler consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  He also agreed to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any such order, and to be subject to court approval of the final judgment.  For further information, see United States v. Al-Din, 631 F.3d 684, 689.   The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Baltimore Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, and the Maryland Office of the Attorney General in this matter."
