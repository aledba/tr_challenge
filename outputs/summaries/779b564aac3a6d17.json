  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against a Connecticut man for his role in an October 2014 drug-related scheme.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Connecticut, on October 21, 2014, officers surveilled Nevin Lowe's motel room and saw him enter and exit the room with a search warrant for room 208 of the Honeyspot Motor Lodge in Stratford, Connecticut. The complaint alleges that the officers observed Lowe enter the room and exit, and that he was sitting in a chair near the TV stand when the officers entered the room.  The complaint further alleges that Lowe was not in exclusive possession of the narcotics at issue, and the officers took him into custody after seeing him throw $40, all in $10 bills into the bathtub.  As alleged in the complaint, Lowe had not been seen by the surveilling officers in the area of the motel or elsewhere prior to that period of time.  In addition, the complaint alleges, as alleged, that Lowe, in addition to the four unidentified females, was present in room 208 when the police officers executed the search warrant and saw Lowe exiting the room, which the officers described as a small room where \"[e]verything is within a hop.\"  The SEC alleges that, based upon the evidence presented at trial, that the defendant knew of the presence and character of the drugs at issue and had control over them.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Bischoff also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to a three-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any drug, including, without limitation, possession of a controlled substance, a penny stock, or any other form of controlled substance in violation of the federal securities laws, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jason Creatore and Jonathan Policano of the Connecticut Office of Criminal Investigations, and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Creatore. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
