  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Brodie M. Butland, Esq., Porter, Wright, Morris & Arthur, LLP (Porter Wright), and, by implication, The Law Offices of Joe B. Steimel, P.C. (Steimel) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, Butland and Porter Wright asked ReynoldsStrong to prepare a liability waiver in connection with ReynoldsStrong's business and a memorandum outlining Missouri's regulation of dietetics. The complaint alleges that Butland replied that he did not receive any confidential information, but instead received an email from ReynoldsStrong in which he stated that all of his company's revenues, regardless of the source, were \"deposit[ed] into the same bank account.\"  The complaint further alleges that Asgaard Funding LLC and ReynoldsStrong consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Crane, Mark Rippetoe, and John Hutton of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by ReynoldsStrong. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Office of Inspector General."
