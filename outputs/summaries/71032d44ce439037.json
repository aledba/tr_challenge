  "summary": "On January 24, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered final judgments against Cesar Perdomo and Uriel Soria-Ocampo in a drug conspiracy case that led to their arrests and convictions. The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that, contrary to the defendants' representations to the court, the defendants were not substantially less culpable than the average person in the joint criminal activity.  According to the SEC's complaint, the court did not err in determining that the five kilograms of cocaine was in furtherance of the joint drug activity, and the defendants did not commit clear error in finding them liable for five kilograms or more of cocaine.  In its judgments, the Court found that both defendants were responsible for arranging the purchase and sale of five kilograms, determined that both of them were responsible, and recommended a downward adjustment under the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, both defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, require them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties equal to the amount of money they have already been ordered to pay, and requires them to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-registered broker-dealer for at least five years.  On January 26, 2018 the court issued a final judgment finding that it erred in finding both defendants liable for their roles in a joint drug conspiracy, and that the court should consider whether to impose a penalty of at least 69 months in prison followed by a three-year officer-and-director bar.  It also ordered the defendants to consult with their attorneys before they began cross-examination, which is a prerequisite for a reasonable determination of whether a defendant is liable for a mitigating role adjustment.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in New York City, alleging that the district court erred by failing to consider the scope of the alleged drug conspiracy when it found that one of the defendants had a motive to commit a felony and the other defendant had a reasonable role in planning or organizing the criminal activity at issue. The complaint also alleges that the District Court violated Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, conduct-based injunctions and civil penalties against the defendants, and a penny stock bar against Per"
