  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon for failing to raise a separate due process claim on direct appeal.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, in 2006, a state court indicted Smith and his wife Sonya on charges of malice murder, five counts of felony murder, and four counts of cruelty to children in the first degree. According to the complaint, Smith's wife, Sonya, repeatedly restrained Josef and locked him in a closet for long periods of time during closing arguments. The complaint further alleges that Smith was taken aback by the prosecutor\u2019s conduct during closing argument, and that he did not object because he had not observed the conduct at all. The SEC also found that Smith violated his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel and the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Smith consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 30 years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Atlanta today announced criminal charges against Smith and Sonya. The case was investigated by the Atlanta Regional Office, which conducted an independent and adequate review of the case. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Georgia Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Georgia Department of Justice."
