  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of second-degree assault in the second degree.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Charles, Missouri, alleges that on September 16, 2016, Lawrence C. Appellant entered a guilty plea in a civil injunctive action and was sentenced to 12 years and 13 months in prison.  According to the complaint, the court found that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and that the jury should determine whether to impose a penalty based on the defendant\u2019s actions.  In a parallel action, on March 19, 2018, a federal district court in Kansas City, Mo., entered a judgment in the matter that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions, ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.  Appelant also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, other than for his own personal use, and to be subject to the appointment of a Judge.  On March 20, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Missouri Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order, ordering the defendant to surrender his passport, and ordering the court to issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the receiver.  A hearing for the receiver was scheduled for April 11, 2019.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of the Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations, with the assistance of the Assistant Director of the Department of Justice's Office of Public Health and Public Safety.   The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri Attorney General's Office, and the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services."
