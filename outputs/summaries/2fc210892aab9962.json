  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against the Tunica County Board of Supervisors for failing to comply with the statutory requirements for a tax levy.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that on August 25, 2014, the Board of County Supervisors of Mississippi issued an order requiring the filing of a bill of exceptions pursuant to Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the order required that the county's tax levy be filed with the court as required by the federal securities laws.  In addition, the court found that the proposed tax levy violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b)(5) and 13(a)(2)(A) of Exchange Act Section 10-b) and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder, and ordered the county to pay a civil penalty of $2,043,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the board of supervisors agreed that it lacked jurisdiction to determine whether to impose a tax on the county or to issue an order to pay the penalty. The court also agreed that the amount of the civil penalty should be determined by the court at a later date.  On October 6, 2015, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of New York granted the District Attorney's Office's request for an emergency asset freeze and issued a temporary restraining order against the issuance of any such asset freeze or order. The Court also issued an emergency order suspending the issuance, purchase, offer and sale of any penny stock and ordering the payment of a $100,000 civil penalty.  A hearing scheduled for September 30, 2015 is scheduled for 5:00 p.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mississippi Secretary of State's Office, and the Mississippi Department of Insurance."
