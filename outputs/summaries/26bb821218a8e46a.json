  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Port Allen man accused of opening fire on three people at a Las Vegas casino.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in New Orleans, Demetri Robinson entered the Cajun Circus Casino on September 17, 2011 and shot at three people, striking one of the victims in the head. The complaint alleges that Robinson was provided ineffective assistance by his prior counsel, who was ineffective and did not adequately investigate or prepare for the defendant's conduct at the time of the offenses. The SEC alleges that, on March 5, 2015, the defendant withdrew his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity and, at a hearing on January 13, 2016, he was sentenced to 40 years imprisonment at hard labor on each count, to be served concurrently.  The complaint further alleges that on April 4, 2018, the trial court granted the defendant a final assignment of error, finding the defendant competent to stand trial and imposing a minimum of a ten-year sentence on each of the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Robinson consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Department for New Orleans today announced that it filed criminal charges in the case against Robinson, charging him with three counts of attempted second-degree murder.  To learn more about insanity, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018.  On January 12, 2019, Judge Edward J. Gaidry granted the motion to vacate the guilty pleas and ordered the defendant to submit a competency determination to the court for a decision on whether or not to proceed with a trial.  A hearing on February 13, 2018 was conducted by staff members of the sanity commission, including Kelly, Darnell, Kelly, and Vosburg, and the case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The hearing followed by testimony from a forensic psychiatrist, who concluded the defendant had a significant mental illness that rendered him incompetent. The trial court denied the request to restrout and enjoin the defendant from future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordered him to be restrained and restrained from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the securities industry. The court also denied the defendants' motion to withdraw their guilty pleas"
