  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against J.P. Lee, M.D., who was sentenced to six months of involuntary commitment based on a finding by the court that he was \"extremely paranoid\" and \"tense and aggressive.\"  The court also found that J. P. had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and had been involuntarily committed to a hospital for six months.  According to the court's order, filed on March 6, 2018, the court found that, contrary to the Court's finding, J.p. was \"quite constricted in not acting although feeling threatened and borderline nasty,\" and that he \"was unable to work constructively with others in the community in which he presented at the commitment hearing.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Lee.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Lee with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Lee consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and a $20,000 officer-and-director bar.  In addition, Lee agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public health institution for five years, and to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service, for a period of five years.  Lee also agreed to a three-way telephone conference with his mother, in which she acknowledged the risk of harm to herself and others, and agreed to participate in the offering of a \"reasonable\" alternative to hospitalization.  On March 8, Lee pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud in connection with the same conduct alleged in the complaint, and was subsequently sentenced to a total of six months in prison.  He was also ordered to return to the community immediately after he was committed to Southcoast Behavioral Health, where he would be supervised by a licensed clinical trial physician.  As a result of his cooperation with the trial court, Lee has agreed to the imposition of a five-year bar and to the appointment of a new officer and director of the public health agency.   The settlement is subject to court approval. "
