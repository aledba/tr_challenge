  "summary": "On March 29, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia entered an order denying a private citizen\u2019s application to present a complaint to the grand jury to obtain indictments against two defendants in an ongoing criminal case.  The court held that, as alleged in the complaint, Edward Jesse Dreyfuse, a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for first-degree murder and burglary in October 2013, was entitled to the right of meaningful access to the court system when, in fact, he was not entitled to that access because he was a felon. The court also ruled that a circuit court has supervisory authority over a grand jury when it is confronted with a potential abuse of process by a criminal defendant.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in West Virginia on April 9, 2012, Mr. Dreyffuse was indicted on one count of first- and second-degree felony murder, a felony burglary, and two counts of assault during the commission of a felony. The SEC alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for West Virginia today announced criminal charges against Dreyefuse.  On March 29th, the court granted the SEC request for an emergency court order halting the defendants\u2019 pending motions for a preliminary injunction, ordering the defendants to surrender their passports, and ordering the destruction of any evidence that may have been collected in connection with the alleged misconduct.   The SEC also requested a temporary restraining order, an order appointing a receiver, and an order requiring the destruction and destruction of evidence.  To learn more about this matter, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (January 24, 2019)."
