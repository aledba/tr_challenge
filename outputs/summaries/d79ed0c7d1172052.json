  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Robert Whittaker, a St. Louis, Missouri man, on two counts of first-degree robbery and armed criminal action arising out of an incident in which he used a knife when confronted while stealing a lawn mower.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on August 1, 2015, in the City of Louis, A.M. a man confronted him with a knife and told him to get back or he would cut him.  The complaint alleges that, instead of using force to overcome resistance to the taking or keeping of the lawnmower, the defendant used a bungee cord to hold the knife in his hand and held the knife at the store clerk and other patrons.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the court found that the defendant had not abandoned the property when confronted and that he did not threaten the use of force when confronted.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against a second defendant in the same case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On August 2, 2017, a federal district court in Kansas City, Missouri entered final judgments against the defendants in two other criminal actions arising from the same conduct.  Among other things, the jury found Whittakaker guilty on all counts, and ordered him to pay a penalty of fifteen years and a $75,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Department of Justice."
