  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Paul Valliere and Ellen Shea, the conservatrix and executrix of Marjorie Valliere's late husband, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that the federal government improperly concluded that the community spouse allowance was controlled by a court prior to the application for, and award of, Medicaid.  According to the complaint, the court found that, under the federal law, a community spouse is entitled to a \"community spouse allowance\" that is equal to or greater than the amount of the individual spouse's income.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of the court's finding, the department was unable to determine the appropriate amount of community spouse support for Paul.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars them from serving as officers or directors of any state-administered health care program.  Separately, the SEC filed an administrative action against the Department of Health and Human Services, alleging that, in violation of Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2)(A), the federal reporting requirements for certain state programs, that the department violated the reporting requirements and the reporting provisions of Sections 15(e)(2) and (3), and that the complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On October 17, 2013, the Honorable Judge Richard J. Mascianica of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Connecticut entered a judgment against the department, finding that it had the authority to determine whether to apply for, or issue an order to grant, community spouse assistance to an institutionalized spouse of a person receiving Medicaid, and ordering the department to provide for a hearing on the matter at a later date.   In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order to expedite the implementation of the emergency relief order, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Public Health and the Office of the Secretary of State's Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Connecticut Department of Insurance, and the Connecticut Office of Insurance Regulation."
