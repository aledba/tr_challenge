  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Big Picture Loans, LLC, Ascension Technologies, Inc., and others for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Big Picture and Ascension violated the federal securities laws by failing to comply with certain of the provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, the Tribe agreed to a cease-and-desist order from the federal government, which prohibited them from violating the securities laws.  According to the complaint, Big Picture, Ascension, and others violated Section 12 of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20 thereunder, as well as Sections 13(a)(2)(A) and 13(c)(3)(B).  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Tribe violated Section 17(e)(1)(A)(B) and Rule 13a-3 thereunder and that the tribe violated Section 13e-2(b).  The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from future violations of Section 12(b), and require them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against all defendants, including Big Picture's co-manager, Gertrude McGeshick, a member of the Tribe, and a co-owner of a private company that claimed to be part of the tribe.  A federal court has also ordered the Tribe to conduct a jurisdictional investigation, which will be conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mississippi Department of Financial Services, and the Alabama Department of Banking and Securities and Insurance."
