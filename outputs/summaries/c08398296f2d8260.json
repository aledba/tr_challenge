  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin today entered a final judgment against the City of La Crosse and its companies in an emergency action to halt construction of a high-voltage transmission line.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Wisconsin, alleges that, in October 2013, the Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) issued an order denying a request for a temporary restraining order (CPCN) from proceeding with a project to construct and operate a 345 kilovolt high voltage transmission line in the town.  According to the complaint, the DOR issued its order on April 23, 2015, denying the Town\u2019s request to proceed with the construction of the transmission line, finding that the project was not necessary because transmission lines had recently been constructed in the same general area, and additional lines were not warranted due to slow growth projections for that area. The complaint also alleges that the PSC had not provided a rational basis for its determination that it was not practicable to utilize an existing transmission line for a seven-mile portion of the proposed new line located in the Town.  In its final judgment, the court found that the DTR was not required to consider the merits of the case, and that it had jurisdiction to determine the adequacy of the decision.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's order, DOR and the companies consented to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains the Court's order against them. The court also denied the Town's request for an injunction, which would have prohibited it from continuing to work on the project until it was deemed reasonable by the court.  DOR also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlements are subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Wisconsin Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Wisconsin Office of Inspector General in this matter."
