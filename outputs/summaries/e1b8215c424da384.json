  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Canadian citizen who was convicted of orchestrating a series of false and misleading statements in connection with an ongoing U.K.-Afghan counterterrorism investigation.  According to the SEC's complaint, Muhanad Mahmoud Al-Farekh, who was born in Houston, Texas and raised in the United Arab Emirates, was the driver and bodyguard of an al-Qaeda leader who was later convicted for the same conduct.  The complaint alleges that, in exchange for his cooperation in the investigation, he was required to provide a copy of the FBI's CIPA motions to the court, which were approved by the court without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle East today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendant\u2019s assets, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of up to 45 years.   The SEC also announced that, on March 14, 2017, Judge Brian M. Cogan granted the SEC the right to request an emergency asset freeze and to hold a hearing on the matter pending final approval of the final judgment.  On March 16, 2018, the court granted the request for a temporary asset freeze, ordered a hearing in which the SEC will determine whether to proceed with its investigation, whether to impose a preliminary injunction, and whether to issue an officer-and-director bar.  Without providing any additional information, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as an order to bar the issuance of a court order prohibiting the destruction of documents, including documents, from being used as evidence in a criminal case, and imposing a conduct-based injunction against further violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  Finally, the Court granted the motion for a hearing and ordered that the hearing be conducted by a certified public accountant and supervised by a licensed trial attorney. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and Carol A. Mascianica of the Boston Regional Office, and is being supervised by Marc Blau of the Office of International Affairs.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Canadian Securities Inspection Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Canadian Attorney General's Office in this matter."
