  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of a widower who died intestate.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Des Moines, Iowa, alleges that Charles Wayne Van Duzer and his wife, Amy C. Bliven, executed a transfer on death (TOD) agreement in 2003 naming their only son, Lester D. Gardiner Jr., as the sole primary beneficiary of their estate.  According to the complaint, the TOD agreement designated Beverly as a \"partner\" in the estate and required her to keep half of the assets in her brokerage account.  In addition, the settlement agreement required Beverly to relinquish half of her estate to Lester Sr. upon his death.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Beverly consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Beverly also agreed to settle her estate tax case by agreeing to a settlement agreement that included a provision that would require her to give effect to the estate tax.  She also agreed not to participate in any estate planning or estate tax planning activities.  As a result, Beverly has no right to the assets of her father-in-law, and the estate is not entitled to an inheritance tax exemption under the federal securities laws.   The court also ruled that Beverly failed to meet her burden of proof on the issue of whether she had sufficient mental capacity to execute the TOD agreement and that the estate was entitled to a refund of the $106,500 owed to her.  Finally, the court agreed that Beverly did not have the capacity to fulfill the obligations of the settlement agreements and that she had to pay the full amount of her inheritance tax owed upon Lester Sr.'s death, which was deemed reasonable by the court of competent jurisdiction.  On August 17, 2003, the SEC issued an order requiring Beverly to surrender her assets in the form of a \"guaranteed asset,\" which she did not do, and that Beverly would not be able to do so until she was certain of the facts presented in the complaint.  It also ordered Beverly to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000, which would be offset by the estate\u2019s share of the inheritance tax paid to Beverly.  Additionally, the order requires Beverly to give consent to the transfer of any assets to a designated beneficiary. "
