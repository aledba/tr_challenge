  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against defendant Christopher Granado on the charges of principal to racketeering, a violation of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Beauregard Parish, Louisiana, on January 27, 2016, Granado was indicted by a grand jury as a principal to a scheme to distribute methamphetamine from February 1, 2015 to March 9, 2016. The complaint alleges that Granado entered an open-ended plea of guilty to the charges and agreed to a sentence of seven years and/or a fine of up to $1 million. The SEC alleges that the plea agreement, which was approved by the court on January 9, 2018, contained numerous false statements, including that the amount of methamphetamine involved in the scheme was \"up to a million dollars\" and that the sentence would be imposed at a sentencing hearing following receipt of the complaint.  The complaint further alleges that defendant's counsel failed to properly and accurately communicate the State's plea offer to Mr. Granado: (1) by advising him that he would be sentenced to a seven-year sentence and (2) when he reasonably relied on his counsel's statement and pled guilty on the strength of his plea agreement.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $50,000.00. The court also granted the defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Granado. The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Retail Strategy Task Force encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling or selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and\u00c2\u00a0find\u00c2\u00a0proof of investment in\u00c2\u00a0an investment that\u00c2\u00a0may be\u00c2\u00a0achievable\u00c2\u00a0under the right\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0"
