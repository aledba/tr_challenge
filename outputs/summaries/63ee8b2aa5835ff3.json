  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the United States of America for failing to adequately protect the safety and security of boaters and swimmers at Sandy Point, Florida.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, in the wake of Sandy Point's September 11, 2005, announcement that it would close its doors on boating, swimming, and boating in the area, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New Orleans announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the SEC's Complaint, the defendants failed to properly regulate the use of motorized vehicles in this environment and did not post any signs warning the public about the dangers.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants did not adequately inform the public of the dangers posed by the boats.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar in the amount of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 556 F.3d 326, 328 (Feb. 26, 2019).  The Complaint also names Varig Airlines as a defendant for the purpose of recovering from its alleged violations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Florida Office of Inspector General, and the Florida Department of Fish and Wildlife in this matter."
