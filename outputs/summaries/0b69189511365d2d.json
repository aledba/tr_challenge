  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Kentucky yesterday entered a final judgment against Kentucky-based Southern Health Partners, Inc., a medical services provider, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky on September 10, 2015, Russell Pope, a former psychiatric nurse at Kenton County Jail, told his supervisor that he was an \u201caffiliate\u201d of SHP, which he believed had conducted an investigation into Pope\u2019s allegations and had learned that a jail deputy had engaged in inappropriate and offensive behavior at work.  The complaint alleges that Pope then signed a release agreement with SHP that required him to leave the jail immediately and barred him from reentering the jail.  As alleged in the complaint, Pope was not an affiliated company under the release agreement, but rather a third party under the terms of the agreement.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Kentucky today announced criminal charges against Pope.  On September 16, 2016, a federal district court in Lexington, Kentucky, entered a judgment against Carl, finding that he violated the anti-harassment provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Scott A. Thompson. The litigation will be led by Graham Loomis and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kentucky Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
