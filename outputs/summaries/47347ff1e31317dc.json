  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Foster Wheeler LLC, a Texas-based construction company, and its former owner, William Berry, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Foster Wheeler violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the defendants failed to adequately disclose to the jury that they had been exposed to asbestos in the mill's boiler rooms, and that they were not liable as a result of the alleged exposure. The SEC alleges that, contrary to the defendants' representations, Foster Wheeler failed to show that the boiler rooms were not covered with asbestos, that J. Graves was a \"professional vendor and contractor\" who installed the boilerers, that he provided the insulation for the boilers and that he was aware of the hazards of asbestos. Foster Wheeler also failed to mention the fact that it never requested a jury instruction or interrogatory on the subject of the case. The court also denied Foster Wheeler's motion for a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the federal securities laws, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million and $2 million, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert on the dangers of asbestos, warning investors to be wary of investing in projects with high risk of asbestos exposure.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC's Retail Strategy Task Force has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0Advisers to Investors in Financial Instruments, Inc.
