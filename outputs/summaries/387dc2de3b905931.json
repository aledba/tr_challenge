  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska today entered a final judgment against Richard A. Kinmon, a licensed big game guide, on four counts of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Anchorage, Alaska, alleges that Kinmon was convicted of four felony counts of tampering with a public record for his conduct during a guided moose hunt with a nonresident hunter in 2011. The SEC alleges that, in the course of the trial, Kinmon lied to the jury about his receipt of the big game tag and falsely claimed that he had purchased the tag before the hunt. The complaint further alleges that he did not fill out the required paperwork and paid for the tag after the hunt was over.  According to the complaint, the jury was not instructed on the meaning of the term \"previously purchased\" and that it required the client to pay the price of the tag at the end of the hunt, even though the client had already paid for it.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the jury did not receive a clear instruction on the definition of \u201cpreviously purchas[ed]\u201d from the trial court on how to determine whether a defendant is entitled to a retrial on four of his convictions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years. The judgment also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, or promotion of any type of hunting license, and from providing any assistance to the Department of Fish and Game in determining whether a hunting license is required by federal law. The court also barred Kinmon from appearing as an attorney or practicing before the SEC as a result of his prior convictions for violating the securities laws.  On the same day, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court against Kinmon for the Northern District of New York, charging him with violating the federal anti-fraud provisions, and for failing to register as a broker or dealer of any kind with the SEC.  It also charged Kinmon with two counts of aiding and abetting a violation of a federal securities law, and charged him with one count of making a false and misleading statement to the SEC in connection with a guided sheep hunt.   The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. "
