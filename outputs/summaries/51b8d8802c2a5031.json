  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in favor of the District Attorney's Office's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against former House Speaker Paul Broun.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that on April 6, 2016, Bowser, then the Chief of Staff of the House Committee on Ethics, made a false statement to a member of the committee regarding the use of federal funds to pay a campaign consultant.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that, at the time of the alleged misconduct, Bowser was not required to disclose material facts in order to be able to determine whether he had a duty to disclose the matter to the committee.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Bowser failed to disclose that he had requested advice from the committee's staff on the purpose of conducting an independent investigation, and that he failed to inform the committee of that fact.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Bowser consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years.  On June 20, 2018, the court granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction against Bowser and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  A hearing on June 21, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 524 (D.C. Cir. 1995).
