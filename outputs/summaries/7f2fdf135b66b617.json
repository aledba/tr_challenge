  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) for improperly segmenting the Perris Dam and Reservoir project.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Bernardino, California, on April 10, 2010, the DWR submitted a draft environmental impact statement (EIR) for the project, which it described as a three-part program that would improve the capacity of the dam to withstand seismic events not revealed in earlier studies.  The DWR's response, which was filed in a separate administrative record, alleges that the project was not properly segmented because it failed to adequately consider the significant environmental impacts of the project and did not adequately respond to written comments submitted by Friends of the Northern San Jacinto Valley, an organization of which Paulek is associated.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, DWR has consented to the entry of a final order permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against the same individual.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Environmental Quality, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
