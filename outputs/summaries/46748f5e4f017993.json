  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on February 26, 2010, entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action against TR Sienna Partners, LLC, a Chicago-area condominium association, for breach of an implied warranty of habitability.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Evanston, Illinois, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the defendants' violations of the federal securities laws, the purchaser of a newly constructed home has no recourse to the builder-vendor and has no right to inspect the construction of the home.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to disclose to the purchaser that, where there is no contractual privity between a contractor and the building contractor, the warranty is not required.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and order them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  On February 27, 2016, the court granted the parties' motion for a temporary restraining order and entered an order requiring the defendants to surrender their assets and to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $1 million, $308,000, and $2 million, respectively, to be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Insurance, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the Defendants.
