  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the United States in a civil injunctive action brought by Jonathan and Cheryl Hunsaker, who filed for bankruptcy in 2004.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Maine, the court entered a temporary restraining order against the government from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 106(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. The court found that the federal government had waived sovereign immunity for nonpunitive monetary damages under Section 362(k) in 1994, and that the court had granted the relief sought by the Hunsakers.  The court also ruled that the waiver was unambiguous and encompasses damages for emotional distress.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the government agreed to the court\u2019s order and agreed to pay $4,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Financial Regulation today announced that it has issued an order suspending the suspension of certain provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 9 of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to the issuance of an order requiring the payment of civil penalties in the event of a default judgment in the case of a similar default judgment.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC request for an emergency court order halting the suspension and ordering the court to determine whether to order the amount of the relief to be determined by a court at a later date.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
