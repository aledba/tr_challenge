  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a motion by a New York City resident to have the court order him or her enjoin him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 20, 1999, Mabel Agho and Rita Fashek obtained a home loan in the sum of $202,190 secured by a mortgage on their home in Brooklyn, New York.  The complaint alleges that the mortgage and note were signed by out-of-state professionals, and that the notary public, Mark R. Pitts, signed the affidavit in Pitts' presence on the date the affidavit was executed.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In addition, the court granted the motion for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants, as well as an order appointing a referee to compute the sums due and owing under the subject note and note.  On September 24, 2010, the SEC filed an emergency action in which it obtained an emergency court order halting the foreclosure proceedings.  As part of the emergency action, the Court issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review that was conducted by the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, including the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Fraud Task Force, which is responsible for the agency's asset freeze and other emergency relief efforts. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Daniel A. Birkenheier. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
