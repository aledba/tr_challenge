  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska today entered final judgments against Gage County, Nebraska, and its insurance company, Employers Mutual Casualty Company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Omaha, Nebraska on February 2, 1989, alleges that Gage Co. purchased three insurance policies from EMC in 1989, a commercial general liability (CGL) policy, and an umbrella policy. The complaint alleges that the CGL policy barred coverage for law enforcement services, and that the umbrella policy did not provide coverage for any of the claims.  According to the complaint, the defendants made intentional misrepresentations in arrest warrants, utilized improper interrogation techniques, conducted a reckless investigation, and intentionally prosecuted the plaintiffs without proper evidentiary support.  In a parallel action, on November 1, 2018, the Nebraska Board of Pardons granted the SEC's motion for summary judgment and granted a partial summary judgment in its favor.  On November 2, the court issued a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the federal securities laws and orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1 million, $2 million, and $3 million, respectively. The court also granted the defendants the right to reapply for a hearing in the future on the same matter.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws, ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $28 million, ordering the defendants liable as a whole, and imposing a $2.5 million civil penalty against each of them. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019)."
