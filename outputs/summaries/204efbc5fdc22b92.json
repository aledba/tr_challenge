  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico on June 25, 2019 entered a final judgment against Christopher Brown, Jr., a convicted felon, for his role in a carjacking that left Jonathan Thomas injured and his car stolen.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Vicksburg, Mississippi on March 19, 2018, Brown's attorney, Troy Kimble, told the court that Brown was entitled to a new trial because he had agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains Brown's convictions and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  The SEC alleges that Brown agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in his opening and closing arguments.  Brown also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Brown.  On June 24, 2019, the Honorable Amy Malone of the U. S. District Judge's Office in Jackson, Mississippi, entered an order granting Brown a temporary restraining order and ordering him to surrender his passport and return to Mississippi.    The court granted Brown's request for a permanent injunction and ordered him to comply with the court's order. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mississippi Department of Criminal Justice, and the Mississippi Office of the Attorney General in this matter."
