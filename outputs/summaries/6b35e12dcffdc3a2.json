  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against a former employee who was convicted of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft based on their use of corporate credit cards to make personal purchases.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, Tamara Andreatta and Stacy Rix were hired as accounts payable clerks by Georgia-based Industrial Manufacturing in Albany, Georgia. The complaint alleges that Mr. Rix asked her to turn in her corporate credit card to pay business expenses, including clothing, vehicle repairs, and trips, and she agreed to use the credit cards in exchange for cash advances and to make deposits into her and her mother\u2019s personal accounts.  The complaint further alleges that Ms. Andratta told Mr. Whitten that she had used the company credit cards for personal purchases, including car loans and airline tickets, when she was not given permission to use them.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Ms. and Rix.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $466,692.41 plus prejudgment interest of $16,500. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Georgia Department of Banking and Securities, and the Georgia State Attorney General's Office."
