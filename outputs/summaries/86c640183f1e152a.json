  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against convicted felon Joshua Taylor in a capital murder case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Taylor violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Taylor, who was originally indicted for capital murder on July 26, 2011, went to the trailer with his friend Michael Love to purchase marijuana.  Taylor allegedly told the officers that he had shot Stallings the night before, and that he did not intend to shoot Stallings, but rather to wake up him from his sleep.  As alleged, however, Taylor did not respond to the officers' questions and instead continued to speak with the men.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Taylor.  On May 30, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Taylor, charging him with violating the antiterrorism provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(A) and (c).  The complaint also charged Taylor with aiding and abetting the officer's conduct in the commission of a second-degree murder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Taylor consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Additionally, Taylor has agreed to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a law enforcement agency, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.  Finally, Taylor agreed to a six-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating or participating in any conduct that constitutes a pre-judgmental decision in a criminal case, including that of a judge or jury.  He also agreed to pay $1,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, which will be offset by a $100,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 penalty.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 542-84 (Miss. 2014).  In its order appointing a receiver of the receiver, the court granted the receiver's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Taylor to surrender his passport.   The court's order also prohibits Taylor from associating with any person who has a history of mental retardation, including"
