  "summary": "On October 1, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against J.M. Williams, a former student at Lift for Life Academy, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Jersey on September 26, 2018 and unsealed on October 7, 2019, Williams, who was participating in a long-term on-site suspension program at Success Academy, told the court that he had observed two students smoking in the front entrance of the school and suspected they were attempting to exchange drug paraphernalia with other students in the building. The complaint further alleges that the student was not permitted to leave the school after being dismissed at noon and was required to report to Dr. Lemay\u2019s office after being asked to leave at noon. The SEC alleges that, contrary to these allegations, the student continued to attempt to communicate with the other students, despite being told that he was not going to be searched. As a result, the school officials conducted a more thorough search of the student's bag, which revealed a small amount of marijuana, a pipe, a substantial quantity of money in dollar bills, and two letters that implicated the student in marijuana dealing. The court also found that the search was not unreasonable because the student had reasonable grounds for suspecting the search would uncover evidence that he violated either the law or rules of school.  The SEC's Complaint against Williams, which was unsealed today, charges him with violating Section 5(a) of the Exchange Act, Section 10(b) of Exchange Act and Rule 10b2-1 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Williams consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078, and prejudgment interest of $2,038, and orders him not to participate in the issuance, purchase, offer, or offer of any securities in the future. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Williams arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC Complaint. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, Eric R. Werner, and Amy S. Cotter of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Werner."
