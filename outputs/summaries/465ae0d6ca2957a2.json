  "summary": "On September 22, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Stahl York Avenue Co., LLC (Stahl), a Westchester County, New York-based real estate developer, for failing to comply with the Landmarks Preservation Commission's (LPC) determination that it had properly denied Stahl's hardship application in 1990.  The court found that Stahl violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the LPC's determination was unreasonable and capricious.  Stahl also alleged that, contrary to its representations to the Commission, Stahl did not have reasonable expectations for the value of the buildings and did not intend to demolish them.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, on August 21, 1990, the New York City Board of Estimate (\"LPC\") granted Stahl a temporary restraining order and ordered Stahl to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the developer.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $20,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the court.  On October 5, 2016, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered an order enjoining Stahl from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and ordering him to disgorge $10,000 in ill-gotten gains plus interest, and to pay civil penalties of $5,000 and $1,500, respectively.  To settle the case, the court granted the relief sought by Stahl, including a permanent injunction against future violations, and entered a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 5(b).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael D. Stallman and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
