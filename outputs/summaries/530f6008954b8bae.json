  "summary": "On April 24, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against Beauty Basics, Inc., d/b/a Aveda Institute of New York, Inc. (Aveda), and its parent company, ELC, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., on March 9, 2016, Beauty Basics agreed to a class-action settlement that would require it to arbitrate all of its claims against BBI.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $5,000 and $21,000, respectively.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Washington today announced criminal charges against the defendants.   The SEC's complaint charges Beauty Basics with violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and ELC with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar, as well as an order requiring BBI to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the complaint seeks an order appointing an independent arbitrator to determine whether to enforce the arbitration provisions of the agreement. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Keltner and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Bekker. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Office of the Secretary of State."
