  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against Willie Dwayne Mickey, Jr., a convicted sex trafficker, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that, in 2010, at age 25, Mickey married 21-year-old Lasasha Ray, a member of the United States Navy.  According to the complaint, Mickey told Ray that he intended to continue seeing other women, and that he would have to \"hustle\" if she was going to engage in a commercial sex act.  Mickey allegedly used force, threats of force, fraud, and coercion to traffic his victims.  In a parallel criminal case, Mickey was convicted of two counts of sex trafficking in violation of the federal securities laws.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Mickey failed to raise the issue of whether he had to be unanimous with respect to whether he could have used any combination of the means to traffic the victims, and instead consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Mickey agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 1591(a)(1) and (b)(3) and ordering him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  He also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On May 2, 2020, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against Mickey and ordered him to return to court on June 5, 2020.  A hearing scheduled for June 13, 2020 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
