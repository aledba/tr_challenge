  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against Gilbert Lundstrom, the former CEO and Chairman of TierOne Bank, for his role in a scheme to defraud the bank's shareholders and to mislead its regulators.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Lincoln, Nebraska, alleges that Lundstrom violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to disclose that TierOne had suffered significant losses in its portfolio of nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties.  According to the complaint, Lundstrom and other senior TierOne executives agreed to delay appraisals until after the bank had reported losses on those loans to the SEC.  Lundstrom also agreed not to receive a new appraisal until the bank \"had sufficient reserves\" to cover losses related to those losses.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  In addition, the court granted Lundstrom's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $24.4 million.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and Carol S. Cotter of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in this matter."
