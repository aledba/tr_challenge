  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment against defendant Eleazar Z. Garcia, who was sentenced to 15 to 20 years in prison for second degree assault and use of a weapon to commit a felony.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sarpy County, Nebraska on March 19, 2019, Garcia, a Mexican citizen, was charged with two counts of second-degree assault and one count of attempted first-degree sexual assault.  The complaint alleges that Garcia consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, which is subject to court approval.  In its order, the court found that Garcia violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his sentence.  Garcia also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay disgorgement of $1,065, prejudgment interest of $192, and a civil penalty of $250,000.  On March 19 the court granted the court's motion for leave to file an amended complaint, charging Garcia with violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws, and ordering him to be bound over to the district court for an additional 60 days to determine whether to impose a penalty of 5 to 10 years.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office.
