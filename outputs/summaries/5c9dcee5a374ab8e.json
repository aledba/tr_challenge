  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Planar Systems, Inc. (\"Planar\"), a California-based microcap company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Planar falsely claimed that its products contained a \"single piece support arm\" when in fact they did not.  The complaint alleges that Planar's products did not have a single piece of support arm and therefore did not infringe the Exchange Act's patents.  Planar also alleges that the jury found Planar liable for indirect infringement because Planar failed to show substantial noninfringing use when the two arms were separated and thus could not be infringed.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint Planar filed, the court has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Planar from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay $185,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the Defendants' profits.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
