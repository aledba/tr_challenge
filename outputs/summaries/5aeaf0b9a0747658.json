  "summary": "On March 8, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of Rite Aid, Inc.'s (Rite Aid) motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the company's assets, and ordering Rite Aid to pay a civil penalty of $750,000.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Rite Aid agreed to settle the pending litigation without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Rite Aid's complaint alleges that the company violated Section 7503(c) of the federal securities laws, and that it failed to comply with that provision.  The complaint further alleges that Rite Aid failed to disclose to the court that it had not entered into an arbitration agreement with the company, that the agreement to arbitrate had not been entered into, or that the parties had not agreed to the arbitration, that there was no reasonable basis for the parties' delay in filing the arbitration.  In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained an asset freeze against Rite Aid and an order appointing an independent arbitrator to determine whether to proceed with the litigation.  On March 6, 2017 Rite Aid filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Manhattan charging Rite Aid with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and the securities registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"), and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, and Rite Aid has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay civil penalties in the amount of $250,000, $50,000 in disgorgement, and $100,000 of prejudgment interest, and to pay an officer and director bar and a penny stock bar.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Federal Office of Inspector General (OIGA) in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool"
