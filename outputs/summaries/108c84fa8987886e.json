  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against BST Corporation for violating the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that on January 10, 2018, BST and Tung Ho Steel Enterprise Corporation of Taiwan entered into a contract that provided for the carriage of steel by SK Shipping from Taiwan to the United States, on a ship to be nominated by SK.  According to the complaint, the contract contained an arbitration clause that required the parties to agree in good faith to the terms of the contracts.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in the charter party, as charterer, the bill of lading contained a clause that prohibited the parties from acting as a party to a specific provision of the contract.  As a result, as set forth in the SEC's Complaint, BST has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the judgment orders BST to pay disgorgement of $2,500, which is equal to the amount of its civil penalty, and imposes a $500,000 civil penalty for each of the parties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's Order, BST agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment also prohibits BST from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any security or other security-related documents.  On March 21, 2020, the Honorable Deborah A. Batts granted BST's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against BST, ordering BST to comply with the court's order, and ordering it to provide a copy of the final judgment to the Commission.   The Commission's order also ordered BST to provide an accounting of the amount and nature of any loss or damage that may be caused by the conduct of its members.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17, July 17, 2018. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Batter and Mr. Kerstetter. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the U.K. Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
