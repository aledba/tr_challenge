  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New Hampshire today entered a final judgment against a Portsmouth, New Hampshire man who defrauded the city of Portsmouth out of more than $3 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portsmouth, N.H., alleges that James G. Boyle purchased a building on wetlands, which had been sold to him by the Department of Education; the building was sold because it was sinking. According to the complaint, Boyle purchased the property because it contained a sewer line, which he later discovered was not clearly marked on the deed to the property. The complaint alleges that Boyle made a \"mistake\" in purchasing the property, and that he has been trying to get the taxpayers of Portsmouth to pay for his apparent mistake through filing various lawsuits. The SEC alleges that, in response to Question 7(B), Boyle allegedly replied, \"When read after the false facts\" that precede it, the defendant's response portrays him as an \"unscrupulous rascal,\" and results in a negative picture of the city that is \"detrimental\" to his business. The court also ruled that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Boyle has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement of $10 million, prejudgment interest of $2.2 million, and a civil penalty of $3.5 million. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Civil Rights today announced criminal charges against Boyle arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.
