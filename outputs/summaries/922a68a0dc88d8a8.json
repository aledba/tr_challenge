  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against the California Department of Fish and Game and the Florida Department of Natural Resources in an inverse condemnation action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that the California Division of Water Resources (DWR) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder, and that the DWR violated Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  In addition, the complaint alleges that DWR breached the sandbar when the water level rose above four feet msl, and failed to provide sufficient protection against flooding.  According to the complaint, DWR failed to comply with DWR's requests for an injunction and a temporary restraining order, and DWR did not respond to the SEC's request for an asset freeze.  DWR has agreed to settle the case against it by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $45,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Department of Water and Natural Resources and the Division of Enforcement have agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal and state securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval. The litigation will be led by John Rymas. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Coast Guard, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. The\u00c2\u00a0SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by\u00c2\u00a0using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also use\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov to quickly and easily identify whether their investments are being evaluated and whether their funds are being used appropriately.  For example, the SEC acknowledges the importance of data analysis when evaluating whether a project is performing well. \u00c2\u00a0In a separate administrative proceeding, the Commission issued an order requiring DWR to provide flood protection in the event of an emergency. The Commission's order requires the Commission to provide the necessary information to the public. "
