  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment in favor of the town of Lyme, Connecticut and its Board of Selectmen in an administrative proceeding to determine the length and width of a state highway.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 13b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  According to the court's order, filed on June 29, 2006, the defendants filed a petition with the board of selectmen in 2006, alleging that the board lacked jurisdiction under \u00a713a-39 for purposes of properly invoking the board's jurisdiction.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants violated Section 13a-40, and that it was entitled to consider the merits of the motion for summary judgment in a trial de novo.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Sections 13(b)(5) and 13(c), and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and bars them from appearing before the court as an attorney or practicing before the SEC as a public figure. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 21, 2019).
