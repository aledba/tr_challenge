  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon for his role in a July 1, 2010 attempted robbery that left John Belcher paralyzed from the chest down.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Kevin Blackman, Marquis Winfrey, Anthony Carmichael, and Kevin Russell violated the antifraud provisions of Section 53(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 53(b) and (c) thereunder. The SEC also alleges that Blackman and Winfrey aided and abetted each other's attempts to commit the attempted robbery. The complaint further alleges that the defendants knew or believed that one of their accomplices would be armed with a deadly weapon during the robbery, and Blackman knew or was precluded from participating in the robbery. According to the complaint, Blackman also told the others that he \"just was the driver\" and would stay with the vehicle. The court agreed with the SEC's findings, and the defendant agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Blackman. The case was investigated by the Office of the United States Attorney's Assistant Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations and the case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
