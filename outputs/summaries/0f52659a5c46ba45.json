  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Connecticut today entered final judgments against two defendants in a civil action that was filed in 2003.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut, alleges that defendant Jayson Phillips and attorney David Styles violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Phillips and his attorney, Arnaldo J. Sierra, misrepresented to the court that the defendants were time barred pursuant to the continuous representation doctrine, and that, in fact, the defendants continued to represent the plaintiff until at least August 26, 2009, when the plaintiff sought no additional legal services from him.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Schoenhorn and Sierra failed to consider the November 9, 2016 affidavit, in support of the defendants' motion for summary judgment, that the plaintiff had filed grievance complaints against him in 2006 and 2010 and had filed an appearance as a self-represented party in the Continental action, thereby causing the limitations period to expire.  As alleged, however, the plaintiff did not file the complaint until after he had retained new counsel, when he had lost confidence in the defendants, and when he sought to file a grievance against the defendants.  Finally, the SEC alleges that, contrary to the defendant's representations, the court improperly considered an affidavit filed by one of the complaint's attorneys, in which he averred that his attorney-client relationship with Sierra ended in August 2009.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Additionally, the judgment bars Phillips and Sierra from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock, and orders Phillips to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the parties.  On the same day that the judgment was entered, Phillips filed a complaint in the District of Columbia against Sierra, alleging that Sierra had failed to effectuate proper service of process on the date upon which he had filed his grievance.  He also alleged that the complaint against Sierra was filed on the same date that Sierra filed his second grievance complaint against him and that he had been unaware of the amended complaint until the trial court granted Phillips' motion to open and set aside the judgment in the case.   The complaint also alleges that the court, in granting the defendants summary judgment on September 19, 2016, failed"
