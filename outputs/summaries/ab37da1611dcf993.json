  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and two other state attorneys general for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that the Texas Department of Natural Resources (DNR) unlawfully obtained a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze in connection with the issuance of the DNR's emergency rules.  According to the complaint, Paxton agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and agreed to pay $425,862.50 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the Texas Secretary of State's Office today announced that it had obtained an emergency court order temporarily freezing the assets of two Texas-based companies that had been charged with violations of the anti-fraud provisions.  Paxton also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for the purpose of enforcing DNR regulations.   The court's order freezes Paxton's assets and orders Paxton to pay a $75,000 civil penalty, a $50,000 officer-and-director bar, and an officer and director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Bocquet and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas State Office of Management and Examinations, which has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC thanks the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for its assistance in this matter."
