  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against the City of Wayne, Michigan and its building and engineering department for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Michigan on February 6, 2019, the city of Wayne issued inspections to residential properties in violation of Section 1484 of the city's property inspection rules. The complaint alleges that the inspections were conducted without a warrant and that the property owner consented to the inspections without obtaining a certificate of compliance.  The complaint further alleges that neither property owner had a right to a pre-clearance inspection before the inspections took place, and that neither of the properties were inspected before a neutral decisionmaker entered the property.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $250,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael Vonderhaar and supervised by Marc Blau. The litigation will be led by Messrs. Frankfurter and Messrs.-Frankfurter. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Michigan Office of Home Inspections and Examinations, which has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or renting a home using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0OnInvestor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint to the Commission on the Rule of Civil Procedure\u00c2\u00a011(a) and (c) thereunder, and the Office of Compliance and Inspections, which administers the Commission's Rule of\u00c2\u00a0Advisers.gov website.
