  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant in a long-running civil action brought by a majority shareholder in a limited liability company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that, in 2009, Clark Briner and two entities he controlled, Revere Investments, L.P. and Fund GP, failed to provide sufficient evidence to determine whether Briner had standing to bring a derivative action against the defendants.  According to the complaint, Briner also failed to disclose to the court that he was a member or manager of one of the companies and that he had a role in winding up the other companies.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Briner failed to adequately record and record the allegations in the complaint and failed to reimburse the plaintiff for the fees incurred by Briner.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and order Briner to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Briner agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws, and the court will determine whether to order him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (January 21, 2019).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant Briner's father, who was also a member of Revere Investment's board of directors, as an additional relief defendant for the purpose of recovering investor funds from Briner, and charges Briner with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of The Securities Act of 1933 and the broker-dealer registration provision of Section 13(b)(2)(A) thereunder of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder.  It further names as relief defendant Saunders Capital, LLC, as well as a defendant for liability arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  Finally, the court found that, as a result of the litigation action Briner engaged in, neither Briner nor Saunders Capital were entitled to fair and equitable treatment under the CLLCA and the common law at the time the complaint was filed.  As a result, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against Briner"
