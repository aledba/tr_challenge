  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New Hampshire today entered a final judgment against New Hampshire-based Cubic Transportation Systems, Inc. (\"Cubic\"), a company that provides back office services to the New Hampshire Department of Transportation (DOT).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Cubic violated the separation of powers doctrine, by procuring from defendant Cubic a new system to support DOT's electronic collection of tolls, using the \u201cbest value\u201d method for evaluating competing bids.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder, that Cubic had no statutory authority to procure the new system because it was not a statutorily-exempt agency and did not have the authority to use the best value method to evaluate the bids in this case.  In addition, the SEC alleges that the defendants failed to establish a reasonable basis for evaluating the bids and failed to show sufficient evidence to justify their actions.  For example, the complaint further alleges that neither Cubic nor Conduent had the statutory authority, and neither did the state, nor the DAT, to determine whether a party had standing to sue for relief.  As a result of the court's order, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requiring them to provide for a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the court has ordered Cubic to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the company has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws and orders it to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.5 million.  Cubic has also agreed to a settlement where it will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations.  On the same day that the trial court ruled against Cubic, a federal district court in New Hampshire entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants, ordering it to comply with the court order, ordering that it be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of service, and ordering the company to pay an $80,000 penalty. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Carl Peckinpaugh and Joseph Goldstein of the Boston Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by John Rymas."
