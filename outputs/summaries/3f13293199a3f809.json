  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of domestic violence for merely attempting to cause physical harm to a family member.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 30, 2017, Mincy was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Mincy followed her outside, cursed at her and told her he was going to \u201cslap the s*** out of you[,]\u201d and then proceeded to hit Charrell in the head with a can of pop.  Mincy pleaded not guilty to the charges and was sentenced to a 180-day suspended term of incarceration and a $1,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mincy.  On March 13, 2018, the Ohio Court of Criminal Appeals issued a temporary restraining order halting Mincy from appearing before the court and ordering him to pay a $2,500 civil penalty, a $100,000 penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the court has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders Mincy to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, and orders him to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Blevins and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Department of Justice in this matter."
