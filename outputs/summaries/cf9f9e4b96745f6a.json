  "summary": "On July 20, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky entered a final judgment against Golden Gate National Senior Care, LLC, a Kentucky-based nursing home, and its owner, Joseph Badgett, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Louisville, Kentucky, alleges that, in 2013 and 2014, the defendants entered into an arbitration agreement at a nursing home at Mt. Holly, Kentucky owned by Golden Gate. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the parties violated the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rules 206(3) and 206 (4)-8 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any admission to the LivingCenter.

In addition, the settlement requires the parties to sign an agreement that is consistent with the agreed-upon terms of the prior agreement. The SEC also requires that the settlement be subject to approval by the court.  On July 21, 2017 the SEC issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an order suspending or issuing an order freezing the assets of the defendants. The receiver has agreed to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining him from future violations of the above provisions, ordering him to sign a copy of the amended agreement, and appointing an independent receiver to oversee the implementation of the new agreement.  As a result, the receiver has no obligation to arbitrate in the future. The court granted the receiver's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against future violations, ordered the receiver to comply with the court's order, and"
