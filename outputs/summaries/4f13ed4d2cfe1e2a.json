  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Secretary of Health and Human Services for failing to adequately explain his interpretation and application of the federal health care law.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas, alleges that Alex M. Azar II violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Azar improperly assigned Henderson County, Texas to the Tyler, Texas CBSA for fiscal year 2015, despite the fact that the CBSA is located in a rural county adjacent to one or more urban areas.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Azar failed to adequately describe his approach and interpretation of the Lugar Statute and its implementing regulation.  As set forth in the SEC's Complaint, the Secretary failed to provide any explanation for his assignment of Henderson County to the Dallas CBSA, despite repeated requests to do so.  Additionally, the Complaint alleges that the Secretary did not adequately explain to the Commission that he made a determination as to whether Henderson County qualifies as a \"Lugar\" county when he assigned Henderson to that CBSA in the 2014 Final Rule.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Secretary from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000 and a $100,000 officer and director bar, and orders the Secretary to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest of $2,500, and to pay civil penalties of $150,000.    The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Fort Worth Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Ms. Boggs. \u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Insurance in this matter."
