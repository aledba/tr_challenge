  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Montana today entered summary judgment in favor of the Estate of Sherman, a California-based general contractor who engaged in roofing work in the City of Pittsburgh.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Montana, alleges that Sherman, originally from California, obtained his Pennsylvania Contractor License in 2011 and enlisted the help of his wife, Kylee Sherman, to help him procure a general liability insurance policy.  According to the complaint, Sherman agreed to work with Williams on renovating a residential property located at 94 Estella Avenue in Mount Washington, Pa. The complaint alleges that Williams, a college student Williams allegedly hired to assist Sherman with work on the project, failed to deliver the policy to Sherman.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Sherman arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On November 18, 2016, the Montana Court of Appeals granted summary judgment against Sherman and ordered him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $3.5 million.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Sherman consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment orders Sherman to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about pre-judgment judgments, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.
