  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a mother and her boyfriend in connection with an alleged domestic violence and neglect case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that on or about March 14, 2017, the trial court entered a disposition order for two children, B.C.T. and J.B.B., who were allegedly abused and neglected by their mother and mother's boyfriend.  According to the complaint, the court found that the defendant had acted inconsistently with her constitutionally protected status as a parent to the children, and that she had failed to comply with the court\u2019s recommendations for the children to be placed with her.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court did not require the defendant to attend individual therapy, take all medications as prescribed, attend couple's counseling with Mr. Matthis, and participate in a parenting education curriculum.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendant has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 10, 2018, the Honorable Carol Jones of the United States District Court for the Northern District of North Carolina granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer and director bar. The court also granted the defendant the right to reapply after five years.   The complaint also alleges that, in a parallel action, the Department of Social Services (DSS) entered into a pre-adjudication consent judgment against Jeffrey and Benjamin, which permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to return to the home where he was previously residing with his mother and father.  DSS also issued a civil custody order against Benjamin on March 15, 2018 and an order requiring him to reside with a family friend in a separate home for the same amount of time as Jeffrey and Ben, and to provide for supervised visitation of at least one hour every other week.  Finally, the SEC filed a complaint on May 29, 2018 alleging that Jeffrey was not a fit and proper person to have the care, custody, and control of the children when he was not in the home with Ms. Mitchell. The complaint charges the defendant with violating Section 10"
