  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against two individuals charged with orchestrating a multi-year mail fraud scheme that defrauded insurance companies out of millions of dollars.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Michigan, alleges that Antonio Martinez-Lopez and Yoisler Herrera-Fernandez participated in a scheme to defraud insurance companies.  According to the complaint, the defendants used a combination of trial evidence and jury instructions to create the appearance of a coordinated scheme.  In one instance, the complaint alleges that the defendants staged car accidents and staged automobile accidents in order to solicit insurance companies to pay for treatments and services they did not provide, and that Sosa-Baladron participated in the scheme by signing blank insurance billings and submitting false claims to the insurance companies for services that he did not perform.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Soca-fernandez consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  On a related administrative proceeding, the court entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of $2,078, and prejudgment interest of $3,829, and ordering the defendant to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively.   The court also granted the defendants the right to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, and to appoint a receiver of the funds. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Insurance, and the Michigan Office of Insurance Regulation."
