  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Denzil B. Hope.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges Hope with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  According to the complaint, Hope, who was injured in an automobile accident in June 2015, sustained a stress fracture in his left knee and required surgery to repair the damage. The complaint also alleges that Hope was not required to show cause for the stress fracture, nor was he required to provide any medical treatment.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, despite having sufficient notice of the injury, Hope continued to experience pain and swelling in his right knee and reported significant pain and discomfort.  On November 7, 2017, the SEC's Office of Inspector General issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment in a company\u00c2\u00a0that offers\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor\u00c2\u00a0assessment of\u00c2\u00a0successor injuries.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that the Commission erred in finding that Hope had established a compensable consequence and that he was entitled to choose his own treating physician based on that finding.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Hope consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires him to return to work after five years.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations with the assistance of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Scott A. Birkenheier and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Virginia Department of Health and Human Services."
