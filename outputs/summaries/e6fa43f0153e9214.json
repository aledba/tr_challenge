  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Arizona today entered a final judgment against Christopher J. Spreitz, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to death in 1994 for his role in the death of Ruby Reid.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Arizona, Spruitz, then a resident of Scottsdale, Ariz., told the court that he had a long-term history of alcohol and substance abuse, and that his family had a history of substance abuse.  The complaint further alleges that, as a result of his alcohol and drug abuse, he was unable to appreciate the severity of the harm that Reid had caused him to do.  Spruitt also allegedly had a severe history of post-traumatic stress disorder, which made it difficult for him to control his behavior.  In a parallel action, the Arizona Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Sprellitz, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Sprelli consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and imposes a $75,000 officer-and-director bar, and orders a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from associating with anyone with a substance that causes him to commit a felony.  Additionally, the court agreed to the imposition of a penalty of life imprisonment, which is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by David A. McKinney and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Arizona Office of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-703(G)(1).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, under the supervision of Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the Arizona Department of Corrections in this matter."
