  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against Randy Lee Thompson, Jr., a Red Lake Band member who was charged and convicted of DWI for driving while impaired on an Indian reservation.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnesota, Thompson was arrested on August 16, 2017, while driving his brother\u2019s pick-up truck.  The complaint alleges that, on that date, Thompson had been arrested for DWI on the Red Lake reservation and was subsequently arrested by a Beltrami County deputy sheriff.  As alleged in the complaint, Thompson refused to submit to a field sobriety test, which indicated that he was under the influence of an alcoholic beverage.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Thompson, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Thompson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.  This case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Minnesota Division of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Minnesota Department of Justice, and the Minnesota State Office of Inspector General."
