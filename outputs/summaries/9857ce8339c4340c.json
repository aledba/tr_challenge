  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a Missouri man who was convicted of committing violence against an offender in the Department of Corrections.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbia, Missouri, alleges that, on July 3, 2009, a jury found Aaron Landers guilty and sentenced him to fifteen years in prison without an evidentiary hearing.  According to the complaint, Patterson, who was incarcerated at the Crossroads Correctional Center in DeKalb, was charged as a persistent offender with committing violence in violation of Section 217.385, RSMo. 2000. The complaint alleges that the jury was not fully instructed on how to evaluate the evidence and was allowed to ignore the defense of another instruction in its deliberations.  In its judgment, the court found that Patterson violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to adequately investigate, interview, and present the testimony of other inmates in the correctional center.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Patterson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The judgment also prohibits Patterson from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock. The court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against Patterson and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order against Patterson, ordering him to surrender his passport, and appointing a receiver. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Justice in this matter."
