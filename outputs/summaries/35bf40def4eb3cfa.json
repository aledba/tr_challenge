  "summary": "On June 6, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Cheryl B. K., the alleged Incapacitated Person, that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the Court to appoint an independent evaluator to evaluate AIP.  The court also granted the Court's motion for summary dismissal of the petition.  According to the court's order, filed on May 11, 2018, AIP filed a motion to dismiss a petition to appoint a court Evaluator based on her lack of access to medical information and providers.  AIP's attorney, Douglas J. Wenig, Esq., agreed to the entry of an order that permanently restrains the Court Evaluators' ability to order an evaluation of AIP, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Court has agreed to a permanent injunction and to the appointment of an independent judge to determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued an order requiring AIP to comply with a court order requiring her to sign an affidavit acknowledging her limitations, lack of effective resources, and need for a guardian.  It also ordered that AIP comply with an order appointing an independent Judge to determine whether to issue an order imposing a temporary restraining order or an order prohibiting AIP from participating in any proceeding with respect to a court-ordered evaluation of a person or property.   The Court's order also requires AIP and her attorney to provide evidence to the Court in support of their motion to proceed with a hearing on the merits of the case.
