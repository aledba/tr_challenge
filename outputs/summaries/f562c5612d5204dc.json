  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Lynn, Massachusetts man who was charged with perpetrating a long-running criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Lynn, alleges that on July 21, 2015, a Lynn man was shot in the leg while walking down the driveway of his friend's house.  According to the complaint, the defendant was lecturing the victim about the negative things that the streets bring to people once you get into it.  He also allegedly told the victim that he was going to turn himself in and \"get the matter off his chest by making a statement.\"  The complaint further alleges that the defendant did not respond to the officer's advice to the defendant, and that the officer did not ask the defendant to \"clean up his act,\" as required by the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  A hearing for the final judgment is scheduled for May 24, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 564 (2017).  The case is being supervised by Chedly L. Gibson, Chief of the Boston Regional Office.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Massachusetts Department of Justice in this matter."
