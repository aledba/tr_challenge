  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) in a civil injunctive action brought by a group of health care providers and organizations seeking to recover attorneys' fees from state law violations.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that, in 2010, the California Attorney General issued a preliminary injunction against the implementation of AB 5, which significantly reduced the rate of reimbursement for healthcare providers who received reduced reimbursement for services provided between July 1, 2008 and August 18, 2008. The complaint alleges that the injunction violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the right of action under the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on March 15, 2010, a federal district court in California issued a temporary restraining order halting the issuance of the injunction, freezing the funds, and ordering the reimbursement of attorney\u2019s fees to the DHCS. The court also denied the defendants\u2019 request for a writ of certiorari, which would have required the court to determine whether the district court had jurisdiction over the litigation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of federal law, and orders them to pay $70 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1378, 1382, 191 L.Ed.2d 471 (2014)."
