  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by Michael Zubrod's family.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Worth County Sheriff Jay W. Langenbau and Worth County Deputy Joseph Hoch violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants used a taser to restrain Michael, but the taser did not work.  Instead, the complaint alleges, the deputies used it in drive-stun mode, and Michael refused to comply with the officers\u2019 orders to tase him.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On September 22, 2013, the SEC filed an emergency action against Deputies Short, Hoch, and Smith, alleging that the defendants violated Section 718.6 of the Exchange Act and Rule 7b2-1 thereunder, and that Deputy Hoch and Smith violated Section 903.1(b).  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Short and Hoch consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.8 million, and imposing officer-and-director bars.  Hoch also agreed to pay a $500,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Smith agreed to settle the SEC action by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and orders him to pay an $8,500 civil penalty, a $1,500 officer and director bar, and an officer- and director-bar bar.  Michael agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and to the appointment of a receiver of the securities laws.  He agreed to a settlement where he would be entitled to qualified immunity.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael's family and the SEC's Office of Inspector General, and the case is being supervised by"
