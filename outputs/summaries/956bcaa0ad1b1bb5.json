  "summary": "On March 24, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against New Jersey and Texas residents Shawn Wilmoth and Trenton Pool, who are self-described \"professional circulators\" of election petitions.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey on March 24 and unsealed on March 26, 2017 in the Eastern District Court, the New Jersey law imposing residency requirements on petition circulators imposes an impermissible burden on their First Amendment right to engage in core political speech.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the registration requirements imposed on non-resident circulators of nomination petitions, and the issuance of an order requiring them to submit to the jurisdiction of the state for purposes of subpoena enforcement.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Willemoth and Pool consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and (e) the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, and order Wilmoths and Pool to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Pool agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order, ordering Wilmott to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, and Pool agreed not to participate in the issuance, issuance, or sale of any nomination petitions. The court also granted the SEC the right to request an asset freeze and to appoint a receiver to oversee the issuance and issuance of the order. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Burdick and Ms. Pool. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern Districts of New York, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Federal Office of the Secretary of State."
