  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Rhode Island today entered a final judgment against a Providence, Rhode Island man who was convicted of second-degree murder and first-degree arson on May 11, 2011.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Providence, R.I., alleges that Sean Reddy, who was an arson investigator in the Providence fire department, was present at the autopsy of Michael DiRaimo on May 12, 2011, when he observed a laceration on the victim's neck and a \"substantial amount of blood\" underneath him.  According to the complaint, the victim was positioned face down in the living room of the deceased.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant made numerous phone calls to DiRaimon's family members, including his mother, the mother of his child, and the people with whom he lived.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in the hours immediately before the murder and the day after the murder, Gumkowski allegedly engaged in a series of telephone conversations with DiRiamo, including one in which he allegedly threatened to \"write that shit\" and \"don't read ur phone.\"  The complaint further alleges that one of those phone calls was recorded on the night of the fire, and that, when confronted by the victim, DiRimo replied, \"Yes u got ur hands and mouth right lol[,] and [there was] evidence of first-and-2nd degree murder.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Rhode Island announced criminal charges against Gumkowski.  On June 13, 2016, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans (R.I. District Judge) issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the investigation to be conducted by Alexander Chirkov, a forensic scientist at the Rhode Island Department of Health Forensic Science Laboratory, with the assistance of the Office of the State Fire Marshal.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a $1,000,000 civil penalty.  Additionally, the court granted the motion for a new trial on June 20, 2016.  A hearing on June 21, 2016 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m."
