  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against Frostburg Facility Operations, LLC (\"Frostburg\"), a Maryland-based health care provider, for negligently and recklessly failing to timely file claims in the Department of Justice (\"D.C.A.\").  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 23, 2014, Shelia Davis, a resident of Baltimore, Maryland, complained of injuries suffered during her stay at Frostburg while recovering from back surgery. The complaint alleges that she fell from her bed while waiting for a nurse to remove her from the operating room.  The complaint also alleges that Frostburg failed to properly secure her mattress to the bed frame.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Maryland today announced criminal charges against Davis.  On January 26, 2017, the U.C.'s Court of Special Appeals for the District of Columbia entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Frostburg from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Frostburg consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties.  Frostburg also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $30,000, which is equal to the amount of her disgorgment.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott Frost and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Maryland Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Maryland Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
