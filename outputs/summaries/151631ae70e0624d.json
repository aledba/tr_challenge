  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of San Francisco and Ghilotti Bros., Inc. (Ghilotti) in a bid to replace Synergy Project Management, Inc. (\"Synergy\") with a prime contractor. The court found that the prime contractor had not requested a substitution, and that the awarding authority had no authority to determine whether to remove Synergy from the project. According to the court's order, however, after Synergy broke five gas lines and engaged in other unsafe behavior, the city invoked a provision of the contract that requires a subcontractor to submit a \"request for substitution\" before it is required to perform the work. The Court found that this provision violated the federal \"injury in fact\" test, which requires a contractor to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a subcontractor has performed the work within the scope of a contract.

The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Thompson and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson.

The Complaint alleges that the city violated Sections 4107 and 4107 of the Exchange Act and that it violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (d) thereunder, by failing to adequately supervise and supervise the subcontractors performing the work in accordance with those provisions.
