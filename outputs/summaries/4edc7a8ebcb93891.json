  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against San Francisco-based Synchronoss Technologies, Inc., a San Francisco, California-based company charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Jose, California, alleges that, from at least May 2013 through at least June 2014, the defendants created and operated a network of \"synchronizing\" internet-based services.  According to the complaint, the network of these services was designed to facilitate the transfer of data from a personal computer to a service provider.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the network was designed so that users could quickly and easily transfer data across the network.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, and order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  For example, the court found that the defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Rules 5a-5, 5b-6, and 17a-11 thereunder, and that defendants violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and Sections 13(a)(1) and 13(b)(3) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1. The court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an injunction, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  On June 20, 2018, the Court granted the Defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered the destruction of documents, and issued an order appointing an independent receiver to determine whether to issue an injunction against further violations of the federal laws.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Patent and Trademark Abuse has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant search tool to quickly identify whether they are eligible to apply for a penny stock or a broker-dealer bar.  Additionally, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
