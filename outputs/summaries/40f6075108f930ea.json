  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a group of Israeli citizens and entities charged with defrauding Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, the defendants engaged in a multi-pronged scheme to defraud Palestinians by funneling millions of dollars through tax-exempt entities and banks to Israeli villages called \"settlements.\" The complaint alleges that the settlement leaders hired full-time security coordinators who trained a militia of Israeli settlers to kill Palestinians and confiscate their property. The complaint further alleges that Israeli settlers committed genocide and ethnic cleansing.  The court's final judgment, which permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, orders the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and orders the settlements to pay disgorgement of $2,500, plus prejudgment interest of $100,000 and a $500,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on April 5, 2018, charges the defendants with violating the federal securities laws and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating these provisions. The settlements are subject to court approval. The settlement is subject to approval by the court. The litigation is being led by Michael J. Zivotofsky and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and Eric Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The investigation was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Office of International Affairs and the Division of Justice's Cyber Unit will lead the litigation. The Commission on International Affairs will conduct an examination of the issues raised in the Commission's complaint to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support or refute the Commission\u2019s findings, whether the Commission has sufficient authority to impose a permanent injunction, and whether the actions of Israeli soldiers and private settlers in the disputed territory are inherently unlawful and tortious."
