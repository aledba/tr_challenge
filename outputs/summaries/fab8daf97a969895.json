  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against two former college admissions officers for their roles in a scheme to obtain federal student aid.  According to the SEC's complaint, Alejandro Amor was the owner and president of FastTrain College, a for-profit technical college located in Jacksonville, Florida. The complaint alleges that Amor recruited students without high school diplomas and coached them to lie to FastTrain admissions officials and claim that they had graduated from high school or had a GED. In reality, according to the complaint, Amor received federal student loans from the Department of Education, and he used the money for his own benefit, the benefit of others, and to pay for his personal and family expenses. The SEC alleges that, when Amor sold two of the college campuses, the profits from those sales were transferred to Amor's personal bank accounts. Amor also allegedly instructed the admissions officers to use a \"snatch-and-grab\" strategy to solicit new investors, which included recruiting students without college diplomas who were ineligible to receive federal student loan funds.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to disclose to the admissions officer that they were subject to a forfeiture money judgment based on a \"proceeds traceable\" finding in a federal court case.  In addition, the complaint alleges Amor failed to inform the district court that he was subject to forfeiture, despite knowing that the amount of forfeiture due was $1.9 million and that he owed $231,000 in restitution.  Amor has also agreed to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Welshhans. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Florida Office of Financial Regulation."
