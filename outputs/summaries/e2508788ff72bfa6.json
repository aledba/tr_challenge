  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Clinton Loehrlein, who was convicted of two counts of felony attempted murder and one count of felony resisting law enforcement.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that, on January 22, 2017, the defendant entered a jury questionnaire that asked whether potential jurors or their family members had ever been charged with or convicted of a crime. The jury questionnaire, which asked whether anyone had been a victim of domestic violence, was inaccurate and misleading.

The order also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock, including securities in the securities industry. The court also denied the defendant's motion to be re-instated as a member of the jury based on the facts and circumstances before the court, including the fact that the trial counsel and jury consultant had not reviewed the jury questionnaire before the trial.
