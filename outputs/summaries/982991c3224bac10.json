  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Fortress, Inc., a Texas limited liability company, for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed on September 6, 2017, alleges that, on March 15, 2016, a federal district court in California issued a default judgment against Accasvek, LLC, which it believed lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.  According to the complaint, the court found that the default judgment was void because the court lacked jurisdiction over certain of the parties, and that the court could not determine whether the parties were citizens of California or Delaware.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Fortress failed to provide any relevant facts regarding the citizenship of the members of the defendant Limited Liability Company (LLC) or its parent company, Medici Portfolio, LLC (collectively, \"the company\").  The complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to disclose certain of those facts to the court, and failed to inform the court that the judgment lacked jurisdiction. The complaint charges Fortress with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Fortress consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions, and orders Fortress to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $678,867.88.  Fortress agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, ordering it to provide a copy of the judgment to the SEC, and ordering Fortress to provide an accounting of its assets. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1371 (March 20, 2016).  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia today announced criminal charges against Fortress. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
