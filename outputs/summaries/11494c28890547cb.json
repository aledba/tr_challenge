  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio on September 9, 2017 entered a final judgment in favor of the Ohio Department of Public Safety and the Ohio State Liquor Control Commission in a related administrative proceeding.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, the Ohio Division of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (DLCRA) issued a temporary restraining order on June 14, July 17, and October 24, 2014, imposing a $25,000 civil penalty on violators of Rule 52 of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that the DLCRA violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Commission has agreed to the entry of an order that permanently restrains or abridges the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States and Ohio constitutions, and that the Commission's order will be permanently enjoined from violating the above-mentioned provisions.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC also issued an order requiring the Commission to conduct a strict scrutiny analysis in determining whether Rule 52 is constitutional and whether it is reasonable to suspend or revoke a permit.  On October 19, 2016, the court issued a preliminary injunction against the Commission from violating Rule 52, ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Philadelphia Regional Office, with the assistance of the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations. The litigation will be led by J.L. Spoons and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, the State Department of Health and Human Services and the Federal Office of Inspector General.
