  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company, the company that denied Ms. Gammon long-term disability benefits in 2016.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 23, 2012, in May 2012, a medical transcriptionist at Cape Cod Hospital was denied benefits because she was not totally disabled.  The complaint alleges that, while she was receiving benefits because of her physical disability, she was unable to sit or stand without excruciating pain, and that she had suffered from depression and anxiety.  As alleged in the complaint, the complaint further alleges that she took narcotics for pain and anxiety, and she could not drive.  In a complaint filed under penalty of perjury on January 30, 2019, the SEC alleges that the complaint was filed under Section 502(a)(1)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, Reliance has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John R. Birbiglia and Glenn S. Gordon of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Jennifer Fay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office, and the Massachusetts Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
