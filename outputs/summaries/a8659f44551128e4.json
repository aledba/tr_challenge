  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Michael Mitchell, who was convicted of second-degree murder and first-degree battery, for which he received an aggregate term of thirty-four years' imprisonment.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that, on December 27, 2014, Shannell Holmes was married to the victim of a domestic battery third and felony terroristic threatening. According to the complaint, the victim's mother, Tatiana Curry, and her boyfriend, Shaheed Williams, began arguing and \"tussling\" with their son, Troy Holmes, about their baby spending the night at the Holmes residence. The complaint alleges that Mitchell told his mother that he had a reputation for violence in the community and that he would use deadly physical force to defend himself, Williams, or Anjanae. The court also found that Mitchell had no knowledge of specific prior violent acts by Troy, and that Williams and Williams had threatened and chased Troy through the neighborhood. The SEC alleges that the court improperly allowed Mitchell to introduce testimony about Troy's violent character, including that he was scared and shaking after the confrontation and that the victim had rushed at people in his front yard. Mitchell also allegedly told the court that he \"removed\" Tatiana from the home because he was afraid of her and because she was scared of him.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Mitchell.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Mitchell, ordering him to surrender his passport, and ordering the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Mitchell consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.  Mitchell also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney under Rule 405(a) and ordered to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about how to spot a pattern of aggressive conduct, see the case file on Investor.gov."
