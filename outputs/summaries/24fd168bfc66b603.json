  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against Patrick N. Harris, a former Ohio University Police officer, for obstructing official business and for unlawfully obstructing an officer's investigation.  The court found that, on November 5, 2017, while patrolling in the area of 134 Mill Street in Athens, Ohio, Harris violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, Harris agreed to enter no-contest pleas to both charges, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against him.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Harris.  On November 6, 2018, the court entered a judgment against Harris, finding him liable for violating the obstruction provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Ohio, charges Harris with violating the anti-fraud provisions and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a penalty equal to or equal to the amount of any officer-related injunctive relief. The court also issued a temporary restraining order against Harris and ordered him to comply with the SEC's requests for an accounting of his conduct in the course of his criminal history. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Department of Justice in this matter.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, the SEC\u00c2\u00a0recently issued an Investor Alert about the dangers posed by illegal sales of unregistered securities in the securities industry, including securities fraud. \u00c2\u00a0On November 8, 2018 the SEC filed an Enforcement Alert about an officer who attempted to arrest a woman with an open container of red Stripe, which was later discovered by the officer. The complaint alleges that the officer ultimately arrested the woman, who was later identified by the SEC as Kaitlyn A. Harris."
