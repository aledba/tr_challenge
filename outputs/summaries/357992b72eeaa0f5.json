  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment in favor of a Maryland man who was found incompetent to stand trial for his alleged role in a recent hospital assault.  The court's order, which was entered on May 24, 2018, permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  According to the order, Meddings was involuntarily medicated based on the court's finding that he suffered from schizophrenia and had a history of atrial fibrillation.  In a parallel action, the Court of Appeals previously issued an order requiring the imposition of a temporary restraining order, or CRP, to prevent a person from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in or selling unregistered securities in a regulated broker-dealer.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against him.  On May 25, the court granted the request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Sansone of the Baltimore Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Maryland Office of Inspector General in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-705 (January 17, 2018)."
