  "summary": "On May 22, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against Prime Healthcare Services-Anaheim LLP dba West Anaheim Medical Center.  The SEC's complaint alleges that while she was a patient at defendant's hospital for treatment of shingles on her lower back, she slipped and fell on a recently mopped floor that lacked any warning signs.  According to the complaint, the patient was placed on a hospital bed and given sedatives and tranquilizers to prevent her from falling off the bed.  As alleged, the hospital's purported conduct in mopping a floor did not occur in the rendering of professional services but rather in the execution of its duties to provide appropriate care and a safe environment for its patients.  In addition, the complaint alleged that the hospital failed to raise the bed rails to prevent the patient from falling from the bed, and failed to do so during the course of the patient's care.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Prime Healthcare has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the judgment orders the hospital to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $100,000 and a $50,000 civil penalty.  On June 11, 2012, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the hospital and ordered it to comply with the court's order.  A hearing on June 13, 2012 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern time for the plaintiff to testify before the court that she knew of the alleged negligence on June 15, 2010, but did not file her complaint until June 11 before service of notice for the examination or therapy that followed.  At the time of filing her complaint, she was still in a room with a private bathroom, when she fell off an X-ray table on which she \"was left unattended and unsecured.\"  The court found that the plaintiff had \"difficulty \"understanding\" that she had fallen off the edge of the exam table and had failed to notice that the patient had fallen on the table when she had not been restrained by the attending nurse.  To learn more about professional negligence, see the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act of 1975, which requires hospitals to provide professional services to their patients, including by providing reasonable care and diligence in safeguarding a patient committed to its charge."
