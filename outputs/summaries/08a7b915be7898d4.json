  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against General Electric Co. (GE) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Morrison, Illinois, alleges that, prior to the court's approval of GE's initial remediation order, the company failed to provide the court with sufficient evidence to determine whether there was a risk of imminent and substantial harm to the public and the environment.  According to the complaint, GE used chlorinated organic solvents to remove oil from automotive and appliance parts it manufactured, including trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethane (TCA).  The complaint further alleges that GE's original remediation plan failed to detect the presence of any such contamination, and that GE installed additional monitoring wells to detect and remediate the contamination.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the company did not provide any evidence that it had remediated the contamination, including that it did not have sufficient evidence for a finding of liability under the federal and state laws.  Finally, the court found that defendants had not provided the court sufficient evidence that they were entitled to injunctive relief based on the facts presented in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, GE consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins it from violating the federal, state, and municipal securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  GE has also agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s charges against it by consenting to a court-ordered injunction, which is subject to court approval.  On June 2, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court of Common Pleas granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordered GE to comply with the court order.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court in Chicago, seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions against GE, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar against GE. The SEC previously issued an order suspending GE from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, or promotion of any product or service in violation of the federal securities laws. The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(3) and a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 5(b).  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney General's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against GE"
