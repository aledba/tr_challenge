  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered final judgments against California State University, Fresno Association, Inc. (Association) and California Department of Revenue (DCR) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5097 of the federal tax laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, California, alleges that, in 2007, the California State Board of Assessment (DRA) denied Association's request for a property tax refund.  According to the complaint, DRA issued a written notice of its determination on February 24, 2012, that Association had a one-year deadline to file a claim for refund, which was untimely.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Association consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the DRA from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  Association also agreed to pay $4,190,859.84 in taxes and penalties and to be barred from serving as an officer and director of a public university.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Association.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing Association\u2019s assets, and issuing an order appointing an independent receiver to oversee the collection of tax refunds. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC also issued an order suspending Association from appearing or practicing before the Commission on Taxation and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering Association to comply with the court order, and ordering DRA to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  DRA has agreed to settle the SEC case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the appointment of a receiver.  As to DRA, the court granted the SEC request for an emergency court order and ordered Association and DCR to pay civil penalties of $20,000 each.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 5, 2011, and a hearing on May 6, 2011.  On May 17, 2012 Association filed a civil injunctive action against DCR, alleging that DRA violated the federal anti-fraud laws by failing to timely file a tax refund claim with the Commission, and that DARA violated Section 5098, which requires the Commission to determine whether a claim is entitled to a refund before it can proceed with any action.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Los Angeles, charging Association with violations of Section"
