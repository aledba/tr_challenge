  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a convicted drug trafficker for his role in the Antonio Liddell drug trafficking organization.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Daryl Jones, a resident of Ravenna, Ohio, was a co-conspirator in the alleged scheme. According to the complaint, Jones told the probation officer that he had last traveled to Detroit to purchase heroin six to eight months earlier and obtained ten to fifteen grams of heroin on each trip. The complaint further alleges that Jones allegedly told the officer that each time he went to Detroit, he had purchased approximately one ounce of heroin from a supplier and gave the heroin to others for distribution in the Ravenna area. The SEC alleges that, in reality, Jones did not purchase the heroin, but instead used the same amount of heroin to make the trips to Detroit and bring it back to Ohio for distribution.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Jones violated the antifraud provisions of Section 3553(a)(6) of the federal securities laws, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) and 5(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission Report, Jones consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 137 months. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N.
