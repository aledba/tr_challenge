  "summary": "On February 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against two El Paso County Sheriff's Deputies, David Glenn and Owen McCormack, for conducting an investigatory detention.  According to the SEC's complaint, Glenn and McCormack questioned Jacob Paul Davis in the basement of his parents' home about an alleged sexual assault. Davis allegedly told them that he was in custody for purposes of Miranda and that he needed to tell the truth. The complaint alleges that the deputies entered the room only after Davis had asked for permission to use the restroom and asked him to move out of the bedroom.  The complaint further alleges that Davis replied that he did not have any weapons and asked the deputies to remove the cover and show him a Broncos jersey.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Davis arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On February 4, 2018 the U\u0080\u0099s Criminal Division announced that it filed an emergency action against Davis, who was subsequently charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-on-arrest order.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 17, 2019).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigatory Release\u00c2\u00a0to encourage the public to check the background of anyone conducting an investigation using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Denver Field Office, and the Colorado Office of Criminal Investigations in this matter."
