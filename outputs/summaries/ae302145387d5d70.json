  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered final judgments in favor of the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services (DOH) in its investigation of independent contractor status.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, alleges that, from January 2015 through January 2016, CPR Plus, LLC, a Missouri-based registered nursing home and nursing home instructor, conducted training classes in CPR, and other treatment related to emergency situations, to various clients. According to the complaint, instructors were required to provide training and books, supervise classes to ensure compliance, and check the credentials of the instructor performing the class. The complaint further alleges that instructors were not required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information of CPR Plus. Instead, the complaint alleges that instructor training was conducted personally, supervising classes, and correcting instructors not following CPR Plus\u2019s preferred methods. In addition, as alleged in the SEC complaint, some instructors were terminated with five days' notice for cause, with \"cause\" including improper attire, tardiness, and failure to submit paperwork.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (Advisers), and Rule 206(3) thereunder. The final judgments also require the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office today announced criminal charges against one of the instructors. The SEC also announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting CPR Plus' pending litigation against another instructor.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered final judgment against CPR Plus in a civil action brought by the Commission against the instructor. The court granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations with the assistance of the Division of Employment Security. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. McGlynn and supervised by Scott A. Kasper. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office."
