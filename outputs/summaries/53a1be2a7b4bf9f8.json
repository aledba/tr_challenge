  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant's motion for a new trial against him.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that, on June 12, 2012, a convicted felon, Michael Calabrese, made two false statements to a jailhouse informant, telling the informant that he would use the informant's phone to record his conversations with the informant. The complaint further alleges that the defendant, who was incarcerated at the time of the alleged crime, made the false statements in a recorded statement to a fellow inmate who was also present during the recording. The SEC alleges that in the course of his investigation, Calbrese and his co-defendant made multiple statements to the informant, including that he \"did not get any money,\" that he had been shot in the head, and that the informant had not cooperated with the state's investigation, which was not supported by the evidence presented in the complaint. The court also found that CalabreSe had not provided corroborating evidence to support his claim that he was not under oath when he made the statements, and he had not corroborated the evidence offered by the state. The Court also ruled that the defendants had not violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"). The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendants from using the broker-dealer's platform to solicit investors, and granted the defendants the right to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against the defendant. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Gaunt.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Corrections, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Connecticut State Police, the FBI, the State Attorney General's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Connecticut Office of the Attorney General."
