  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming today entered a final judgment against a Wyoming man who was charged with defrauding a family member out of more than $1 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Wyoming, alleges that, on September 23, 2016, Darren Dumas of Thermopolis, Wyoming, told his wife, Janic Bartlow, that he was going to the Hope Agency for victims of domestic violence.  According to the complaint, Ms. Bartlow agreed to participate in the offering of free services from the agency in order to obtain financial support and to provide a safe place for the family to live.  Ms. Dumas allegedly told her husband that she had to babysit the children, and that she did not want to do that.  She also allegedly told him that she was jealous because she believed that he had feelings for another woman.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Dumas.  Dumas has agreed to settle the charges against him and consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078,098, plus prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil penalty of $250,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Dumas agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years.  He also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Wyoming Office of the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Wyoming Department of Health and Human Services."
