  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Square, Inc. (\"Square\"), a California-based online furniture and services company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in October 2015, filed under the Unruh Civil Rights Act of 1940 (\"Securities Act\"), a federal securities law that prohibits the entry, purchase, or sale of any type of goods or services without a reasonable basis for standing, of any kind.  The complaint alleges that Square and its owner, Steven Surrey, violated the federal securities laws by failing to provide equal treatment to customers who were not entitled to the same treatment as those who were.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Surrey.   The SEC's Complaint alleges that, based on the conduct alleged in the complaint, that White violated Section 51 of the Exchange Act, and that he failed to comply with the requirements of Section 51.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, White consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 51, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his or her actual ill-gotten gains.  On November 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Sansone of the U. S. District court for the Central Districts of New Jersey issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties equal to their respective amounts of money, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date by the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
