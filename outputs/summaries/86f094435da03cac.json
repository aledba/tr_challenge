  "summary": "On May 26, 2017, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) filed a civil action against EQT Production Company (EQT) for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that EQT violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, EQT failed to adequately assess its liability for the violations.  EQT also failed to inform its contractors of the risks posed by the release of wastewater from the S Pit.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the company failed to detect the presence of any contaminants in the well and failed to respond to DEP's questions about whether or not there was a risk of contamination.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, EQT agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that imposes a civil penalty of $10,000 per day, which is equal to the amount of the company's civil penalty.  On June 15, 2012, the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania issued an order requiring EQT to remove the s Pit from the impoundment, which caused significant harm to the water of the Commonwealth, including to the groundwater and to the surrounding wetlands.  Additionally, the order imposed a $1,137,295.76 civil penalty for EQT's violations of Section 605(a) of The Clean Streams Law, which requires that any person or municipality liable for a penalty for a violation of the law and a condition of a federal securities law be determined by the court at a later date.  Further, the court agreed to a settlement where EQT will be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of Sections 307 and 401 of the Exchange Act, and ordered it to pay a penalty in excess of $11,500 per day.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17, Litigation Bulletin No. 206-cv 13-01.  Separately, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection of Environmental Fraud, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Kiskadden and Ms. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
