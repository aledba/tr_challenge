  "summary": "On May 15, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine in favor of a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against future violations of the anti-abortion provisions of the federal anti-fraud law.  The court's order, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In addition, the court granted the defendants' motion for preliminary injunctions and a civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio on April 10, 2019 and unsealed on May 24, 2020, the Ohio Department of Health and Human Services (DOH) and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office issued an order suspending the implementation of S.B. 23. The court also granted the companies' request for a temporary injunction and an evidentiary hearing. The SEC's order also prohibits the destruction of documents and records, and requires the companies to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions, ordering them to disgorge their gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of $10,000 or more. The Court granted the parties' requests for an emergency court order and an injunction, and ordered the companies and their associated entities to comply with the court order. The order also provides for the appointment of a receiver to determine whether to issue an order imposing an injunction or requiring the company to provide an accounting of the number of abortions performed in the United States, the amount of any medical or other legitimate emergency, and the timing of any such emergency. In a parallel action, the Department of Justice today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 25, 2019 the Ohio Court of Appeals issued an emergency order temporarily suspending the Texas-based clinic that administers the state's abortion laws. The emergency court temporarily halted the clinic's operations on May 20, 2019. The investigation was conducted by David F. Forte and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Public Health Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Messrs. Overstreet and Forte. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
