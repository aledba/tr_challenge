  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against two officers who allegedly used excessive force to arrest a man who had been hit by a car while attempting to exit a police car.  The court found that the officers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, on March 2, 2015, two officers of the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, Ammar Rahim and Matthew Rider, were coordinating medical assistance for a homeless man when they observed a disturbance down the street. As alleged in the complaint, the officers used a combination of physical and verbal force to subdue the man, who was acting belligerently and erratically at the scene. The officers also allegedly kicked and kicked a man in the head as he attempted to exit the car. The complaint alleges that, as a result of his actions, Hedgpeth suffered a concussion, headaches, vertigo, and other post-concussive symptoms. The court granted the officers qualified immunity on the basis of their actions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the officers. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges the officers with violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 528 F.3d at 976 (Dec. 31, 2016).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Department for the Northern District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
