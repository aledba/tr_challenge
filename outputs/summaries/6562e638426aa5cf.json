  "summary": "On November 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment against Alpha Home Health Solutions, LLC (\"Alpha\"), a Florida-based home healthcare service provider, that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Alpha to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.418 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that Alpha failed to adequately disclose to the SEC that it had overpaid $1,418,503.47 in Medicare claims for care related to dementia management, lymphedema therapy, and vestibular rehabilitation.  According to the complaint, Alpha also failed to show that the overpayments were collateral and that the SEC had the authority to determine whether to issue a temporary restraining order or an order suspending the overpayment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Alpha.  On November 6, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Alpha, charging it with violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering it to pay civil penalties of $10,000 each.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Alpha agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of these provisions.  Alpha also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay an $8,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Office of Inspector General in this matter."
