  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against two Florida men accused of committing a Hobbs Act robbery.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Marlon Eason and Carlton Styles violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including the \"crime of violence\" provision.  According to the complaint, Eason had prior convictions for robbery, attempted strong arm robbery, and resisting an officer with violence, and he was a career offender.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Eason, Styles, and O\u2019Connor violated the mandatory minimum of 10 years of imprisonment for each of these criminal acts.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendants were also charged with violating the mandatory 10-year minimum.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint or the SEC, defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Eason has also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Eason.  O'Connor has agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations, with the court to determine the amount of monetary penalties to be imposed upon him.   In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Economic and Risk Analysis today issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert on the subject of this matter.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Banking and Securities."
