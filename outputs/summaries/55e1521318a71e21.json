  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 272 months in prison for his role in a multi-state conspiracy to distribute cocaine base (or crack cocaine).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, on May 1, 2015, Lamont Fortune was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC alleges that Fortune, his three codefendants, and Deputy Sheriff Steven Brant Bottomley, aided and abetted Fortune's violations of Section 3553 of the Exchange Act and Rule 3553 thereunder, and that Loftly and Dargan assisted Fortune in his violation of Section 5(b). The SEC further alleges that, after trial, Fortune admitted to throwing out eight to nine ounces of crack cocaine during a high-speed chase that resulted in a highspeed chase and criminal charges against Fortune. The court also found Fortune liable for violating Rule 404(b), which requires defendants to show prior criminal convictions to qualify for an enhanced mandatory minimum sentence. Fortune agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David A. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
