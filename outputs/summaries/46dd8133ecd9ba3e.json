  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on June 28, 2017, entered a final judgment against the Federal Communications Commission (\"Commission\") in a related administrative proceeding.  The Commission's final judgment, entered on May 18, 2015, finds that the Commission violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the Commission consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders the Commission to conduct a conduct-based investigation into whether or not to impose a mandatory one-call safe harbor on telemarketers.  In its order, which was entered into by the Commission, the court found that, in violation of Section 12(b)(1)(A) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13b2-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, that an operator with the capacity to make a call without prior consent could be liable for a civil penalty of up to $5,000.  According to the SEC's order, however, this finding is unreasonable and capricious, and the Commission is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations.  On June 21, the SEC filed a complaint against the Commission in federal court in New York, alleging that it violated Rule 12(a)(1) and 13b-14 of the Exchange Act.  It also charged the Commission with violating Rule 12b3-1 thereunder and aiding and abetting violations of Rule 12a-14.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2017.  Separately, on June 24, 2016, the Court entered a temporary restraining order against the SEC from further violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Exchange Act and Rules 206(3) and 206 (4)-4 thereunder; and ordered the SEC to conduct an independent investigation into the matter.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Eric Werner and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the United States Postal Inspection Service in this matter."
