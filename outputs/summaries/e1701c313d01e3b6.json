  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against Clarence Dean Roy for his role in a 2015 First Amendment retaliation case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on July 17, 2015, Roy and others occupied a public street in Monroe, Louisiana, and were confronted by a group of people outside Club Neat and the Connor Bar preaching at the customers.  According to the complaint, Roy told the group that he had followed them, saying \"ugly, lewd things,\" that she was a \"homosexual,\" and that her \"father is the devil.\"  The complaint further alleges that Roy was neither searched nor seized, and that he failed to make a sufficient showing with respect to his entitlement to qualified immunity.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the city violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Roy has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (Feb. 26, 2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.

District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order against Roy, and issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver"
