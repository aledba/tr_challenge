  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against Fifth Third Bank, Inc., a state-chartered, federally insured bank headquartered in Ohio, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that, in violation of Section 5 of the federal securities laws, Fifth Third failed to disclose to its customers that it had a long-term \"cash advance\" loan program in which eligible customers could obtain a loan up to $1000 at a rate of 120% per year.  According to the complaint, the company also failed to provide accurate and meaningful APR summaries on its customers' monthly bank statements.  Fifth Third also allegedly failed to inform customers that the loan was always 120% when repaid, even if the loan had not been repaid in full by the date of the loan.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Fifth Third violated Rule 54(b)(5) by failing to provide timely and accurate information about the loan's APR, which is not based on a year or any other time period.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d), and orders Fifth Third to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly and easily identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, charging Fifth Third with violating Section 5(b).  The complaint also alleges that the company violated Rule 5a-1 and 5b-2 thereunder, and that it failed to adequately disclose to investors that the payment of the principal and accrued interest associated with the loan is not an annual rate.  Finally, the court found that the defendants violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20 thereunder and that the complaint was filed as a civil injunctive action.
