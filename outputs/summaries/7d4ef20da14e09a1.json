  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against a defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that Judge Robert J. \"Ricardo\" Jolly improperly imposed a downward durational departure from the mandatory minimum sentence of 29.5 months. The complaint further alleges that Powell, who pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated indecent liberties with a child under 14, told the court that he had a history of molesting children and that he would benefit from a reduction in his sentence if he were to be sentenced to a mandatory minimum of 25 years. Powell also alleged that his stepdaughter, who was his daughter, had forgiven him and he was truthful with police during the criminal investigation. The SEC alleges that, contrary to Jolly's opinion, Powell was not a compulsive child molester because he had no history of prior criminal conduct. The court also found that Powell had the necessary insight to understand his actions and to be willing to participate in rehabilitative efforts. In addition, the complaint alleges that the district court improperly classified Powell's prior conduct as aggravating, and that Powell failed to adequately consider the mitigating factors in his departure motion. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Powell. The case was investigated by the SEC's Office of Inspector General, which issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kansas Department of Criminal Justice."
