  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia today entered a final judgment against Travis Ray Norwood, a convicted felon who was sentenced to life in prison for two prior felony drug-related convictions.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charleston, West Virginia, on June 1, 2016, Defendant Norwood was convicted by a jury of his peers on one count of delivery of a controlled substance \u2013 heroin \u2013 in violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The court found that the delivery and use of heroin carried with it a potential for actual violence to a person who had been previously convicted of two prior felonies.  The court also found that defendant Norwood had previously been convicted and sentenced, on two separate occasions, of felony felonies that were punishable by incarceration in a penitentiary.  In a parallel action, on September 25, 2017, the court issued an order suspending Norwood from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any drug, and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Norwood consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for the rest of his life.  On October 28, 2008, the SEC filed its recidivist information with the court, and the court granted the SEC the right to determine whether to impose a life sentence based on the amount of a prior felony conviction or a prior criminal conviction. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia Department of Criminal Justice, the Commonwealth of Virginia Criminal Investigations, the Criminal Justice Department, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the FBI Criminal Investigations Division and the Virginia State Police Forensics Laboratory."
