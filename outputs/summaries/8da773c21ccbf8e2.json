  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a former bus operator who filed a second amended complaint alleging that he was not represented as a member of a collective bargaining unit under the 2007 Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) contract.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on January 1, 2007, Eric Hampton was employed as a bus operator for the CTA and the Transit Unions for approximately 28 years.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the CTA's 2004 CBA, Hampton was unable to participate in the collective bargaining process for the purpose of providing health care benefits to retirees.  As alleged in the complaint, Hampton had no standing to challenge the reduction in his retirement benefits under the CBA.  In addition, the complaint alleged that he had failed to state a cause of action for his retirement, and that, in a parallel action, the court found that he lacked standing to respond to the Commission's findings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s action, Hampton consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  Hampton also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, from participating in any collective bargaining activity, and from participating as an independent contractor in any public company.  On August 21, 2017, the Illinois Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order against Hampton, ordering him to surrender his passport, and barring him from associating with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, investment adviser, municipal bond dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The court also ordered Hampton to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to pay an officer and director bar of the Chicago Regional Office.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Kasper and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Ms. Werner and Ms. Braunstein. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
