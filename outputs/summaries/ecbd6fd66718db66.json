  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment against Kiewit Building Group Inc. (Kiewit), Architectural Wall Systems Co. (AWS), and Zurich American Insurance Co., AWS' workers' compensation insurance carrier.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on February 20, 2012, in the course and scope of his employment as an ironworker on the 12th floor of a TD Ameritrade building, Thomas was injured when he fell on sand that remained on the floor after it was dry.  The complaint alleges that Thomas and another AWS employee, Perry Schafer, were carrying a sheet of siding that was 26 to 28 feet long and 3 feet wide when Thomas fell.  As alleged in the complaint, the sheet was put down as a safety measure to prevent someone from slipping and falling on the job site.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that Schafer and Thomas did not put down the sheet because they did not think there was a risk of falling, and that they had been trained to spot signs of slippery, sandy floors when they were working on the project.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Thomas consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, and the Nebraska Office of Inspector General in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 568 (2017).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Thomas. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
