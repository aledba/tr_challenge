  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Russell Dusty Fleming, Jr., a California man who was convicted of one count of sexual penetration by fraud in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 289 of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on December 15, 2015, filed in federal district court in Fresno, California, the defendant entered the bedroom of a married couple who were having dinner and dancing to celebrate Taryn W.'s birthday. The complaint alleges that D.P., who was asleep on the couch, and her husband, Blake, entered the room without her knowing or consent and began to digitally penetrate her vagina.  The complaint further alleges that the defendant did not wake her up and asked her if she wanted to have sex with him.  As alleged in the complaint, however, when the couple were alone in the bedroom, the defendants began to undress and lie down behind the bed.  After a few minutes, the complaint alleges the defendant reached across the room and reached for his cell phone, which he had just retrieved from the nightstand.  He then began to masturbate, which is unusual for a defendant who is usually asleep at the time of a sexual act.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Fleming.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Fleming consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 289, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of three years and a $10,000,000 civil penalty. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Banking and Securities, and the Arizona State Department of Health and Human Services."
