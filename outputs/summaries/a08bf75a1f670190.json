  "summary": "On May 2, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington entered a final judgment against Rite Aid employee Myung B. Meinhold, who was charged with attempted first degree robbery.  The court held that in order for a defendant to be convicted of a first-degree robbery, he or she had to prove that the person he was attempting to rob had ownership, representative or possessory interest in the property.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Seattle on May 2 and unsealed on May 3, 2017 in the Eastern District Court of Washington, MeinHold was a pharmacy technician employed by Rite Aid when she first noticed Nelson on the counter with a note that he had in his hand a demand for oxycodone. The court also held that the note did not have to be an essential element of the crime and that the defendant had the requisite ownership or representative of the property to complete the crime.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed criminal charges against Nelson. The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the Western Division of the Commission on Economic and Risk Analysis, charges Nelson with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being handled by Wayne R. LaFave, Assistant Director of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit, and John R. Rymas, Chief of the Unit's Analysis and Detection Center. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Seattle Police Department, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
