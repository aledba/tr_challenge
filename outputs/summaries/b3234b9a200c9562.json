  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Michael Weeks, a former marine safety and operations expert, for his role in an October 2017 accident that injured a seaman.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, from November 1, 2017 to November 2, 2018, Weeks provided a report, opinions, and testimony to a jury concerning the safety and effectiveness of the shower design.  The SEC alleges that Weeks's report, opinion, and evidence were unreliable because they did not support his conclusion that the shower was slick and unsuitable, and that he was not in a hurry to leave the vessel.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Weeks consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Weeks.  On March 2, 2019, the Honorable Paul J. Burt of the U.N. Office of Justice, in the Division of Justice's Office of Inspector General, issued an order suspending Weeks from appearing before the court as an expert in this matter.   The court's order freezes the assets of Chem Carriers Towing, LLC, Inc. and Seatrax, Inc., Inc., the companies they control, and the officers and directors of those companies.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Weeks, alleging that he violated Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which requires a court to determine whether a defendant is a qualified expert in the field of maritime law, safety and industry standards, and whether a jury is capable of representing a reasonable person in a legal proceeding. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau of the New York Regional Office. The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
