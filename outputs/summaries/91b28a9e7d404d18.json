  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in favor of the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") in a case that was investigated by the agency's Office of Inspector General.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Rita Purdy was not disabled and was entitled to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits based on her testimony.  According to the complaint, Purdy had been diagnosed with a total knee replacement in April 2011; thoracic and lumbar spine degenerative disc disease; right shoulder rotator cuff bone spurs; severe migraines, nerve damage, and epilepsy; and a history of substance abuse.  Purdy's testimony, which was corroborated by testimony from a physician who treated her for a non-displaced fracture of her left femur, was not sufficient to support the SSA's finding that she was disabled.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Purdy to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced criminal charges against Purdy.  On November 17, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in Brooklyn, New York charging Purdy with violating the anti-deterrent provisions of the federal securities laws.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that Purdy violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act, Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") and Rule 12b-20 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and penny stock bars from Purdy and any other person with the right to apply for the benefit of the SEC.  Separately, the U.K. Attorney's office for the Northern District of California today announced related criminal charges.  A hearing scheduled for November 21, 2017 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 27, 2017)."
