  "summary": "On June 8, 2015, Nataomi Riley and her husband, Frank Riley, filed a medical malpractice complaint against St. Mary's Medical Center of Evansville, Inc. (\u201cthe Hospital\u201d) in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Indiana.  The complaint alleges that a Hospital radiologic technologist (\u2018RT\u2019) was negligent in injecting contrast dye into Nataemi Riley's arm in preparation for a CT scan and that the negligence proximately caused various injuries.  According to the complaint, the ER doctor gave the CT scan results that indicated that the contrast dye had been injected into the patient's arm during a routine CT scan.  As alleged, however, when the contrast media was injected into her arm, the patient immediately complained of pain and told the radiologist or supervising physician that she had always been a \u2018hard stick\u2019 and that she did not follow the standard of care in these circumstances.  In a parallel action, on June 12, 2015 at approximately 5:30 a.m., the court granted the Rileys' motion for summary judgment and ordered the hospital to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the hospital's allegations, the hospital consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On June 13, 2016, the court issued a temporary restraining order against the hospital and ordered it to conduct a conduct-based examination of the CT scans that resulted in the injury to Ms. Riley.   The court also ordered the institution to provide an accounting of the amount of money spent on the investigation.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018."
