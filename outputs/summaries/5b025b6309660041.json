  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alaska today entered a final judgment against Lewis G. and Cassie Y. of Texas that permanently restrains custody of the children.  The court's order, which is subject to court approval, prohibits Lewis from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court found that Lewis failed to comply with the court's best interests analysis when making its best interests findings.  According to the court, Lewis also failed to adequately account for the fact that the children had been in a \"fragile\" state at the time of the hearings, and that he had difficulty communicating with the children during the hearings.  Lewis also contends that the court failed to consider the potential negative effects of Lewis's drug use on the children, and failed to determine whether Lewis should be allowed to participate in practices and competitions while in custody.  As a result, Lewis has been barred from serving as an officer and director of a public school and from participating in any school sports program.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, charges Lewis with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Lewis consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to return to Texas, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.  He has also agreed to pay a $20,000 officer anddirector bar, and to be barred from appearing before the SEC as an attorney or practicing before the court as a public figure. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alaska Department of Health, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Minnesota Department of Banking and Securities and the Alaska Division of Criminal Justice."
