  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Madison, Wisconsin man who was convicted of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that the Madison, Wis., officer who arrested Derrick Johnson on June 17, 2017, failed to adequately consider whether and how Aalto's testimony supported his conviction.  According to the complaint, the officer recognized Johnson from his work undercover in the drug trade and observed him setting up a drug deal using industry slang.  Johnson allegedly used the gun during the arrest to carry out the drug deal.  As alleged, however, Johnson was not well versed in the use of the gun and instead used it for a variety of purposes, including to conceal the fact that he had a gun and to facilitate the drug trafficking.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0order\u00c2\u00a0to expedite the entry of a judgment ordering a permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and imposing an officer-and-director bar.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a company or a state.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued a\u00c2\u00a0statement\u00c2\u00a0that encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a security deposit by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission\u00c2\u00a0Advisers to investors to check background information before making any investment decisions.
