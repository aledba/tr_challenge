  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Sloma for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, alleges that Sloma violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws by failing to disclose that he was eligible to participate in the post-30-year program.  According to the complaint, Sloma was not entitled to a refund of his PERS contributions after his first retirement, but rather to receive a refund based on the amount of his compensation earned prior to his 2004 election.  Sloma also alleges that DRS improperly excluded his Thurston County salary from the calculation of his retirement benefit based on his prior PERS membership.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, DRS agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Sloma from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $920.60, a $1,000 civil penalty, and a $100,000 penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney\u2018s Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Slom.   The case is being handled by Scott A. Mascianica, Eric R. Werner, and Jan Folena of the SEC Enforcement Division in the Philadelphia Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the UAW, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
