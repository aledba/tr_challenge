  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin yesterday entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 48 months in prison for his role in a 2015 Ku Klux Klan-inspired carjacking.  The court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the convicted felon and ordering him to pay a $1,600 civil penalty.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Forest County, Wisconsin, on July 29, 2017, the defendant, Erik Schmidt, told a probation officer that he believed in white supremacy, his hatred for minority races, and his desire to return to Germany to embrace his Nazi ancestral heritage.  He also allegedly claimed that he had tattooed the words \u2018Aryan Brotherhood\u2019 on his hand, which he said meant \u2018one of Satan\u2019s disciples.\u2019  In addition, the court found that Mr. Schmidt was a self-avowed white supremacist, who readily and reprehensibly articulated his bigoted hatred for the very group of people he maligned with his hateful invective.  In a judgment that permanently enjoins Schmidt from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Schmidt to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of 50 months.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the judgment, Schmidt consented to the entry of the final judgment, which also permanently restrains Schmidt from future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of his criminal conviction for the same felony.  Schmidt also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in any type of criminal activity.   The final judgment also prohibits Schmidt from associating with any person with a history of violent or anti-social conduct, and bars him from serving a sentence of 12 months or more.  On August 8, 2017 a federal district court in Florida sentenced Schmidt for one count of possession of a firearm with intent to commit a felony and sentenced him to three years of supervised release.  Last week, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against Schmidt.
