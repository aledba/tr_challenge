  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of two prior felony charges.  According to the SEC's complaint, Justin E. Cavette was arrested and charged with armed habitual criminal and unlawful possession of cannabis after he was found in the same apartment as two bags of marijuana hidden in a bathroom trashcan and a handgun tucked into a full laundry basket.  The complaint alleges that, in May 2015, a jury found defendant guilty of both armed habitual and unlawful use of a weapon and ordered him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  As alleged in the complaint, the jury deliberated for nearly two hours before finding that defendant had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 24-1(a)(3) of the Illinois State Criminal Code.  In its judgment, the court found that defendant was liable for a civil penalty of 3 years' imprisonment and 16 years of supervised release.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to repay the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt of the Chicago Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, the Chicago Police Department, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice Criminal Investigations, the State Attorney's Office of Illinois, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Illinois Attorney General's Office.
