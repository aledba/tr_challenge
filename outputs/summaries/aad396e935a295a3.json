  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found not competent to make informed decisions as to the advantages and disadvantages of accepting particular medication or treatment while a prisoner and was involuntarily medicated without a finding of dangerousness.  The court found that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 51.61(1)(g) is facially unconstitutional as it permitted involuntary medication without a found of dangerousiness.  According to the court's order, filed on May 22, 2015, a Washington state prison inmate who refused to take medication to treat his mental illness was sentenced to twenty years in prison. The court ruled that the mandatory commitment of a prisoner to medication and treatment was a reasonable and reasonable basis for the inmate to make such a decision.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the inmate. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison, Wisconsin, charges the defendant with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against the defendant. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public institution for five years. The order also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service, including the right to participate in the purchase, sale, offer and sale of a security-security-related service, and from participating as an unregistered broker or dealer in a public offering of securities. The final judgment also orders the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $5,000 and a $100,000 civil penalty, and orders the release of any other prisoner deemed competent by the court to be a \"compelling\" interest in providing care and assistance to those who suffer from mental illness.  On May 24, 2016, the court entered an order extending C.S.'s commitment under the mandatory mandatory commitment provision of the state securities laws for a period of five years, ordering him to comply with the court order, and requiring him to submit a written consent to the appointment of a receiver. The receiver of the receiver, Christopher S. Harper, has agreed to the payment of a $1,500 civil penalty."
