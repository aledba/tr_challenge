  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa on November 7, 2017 entered a final judgment in favor of the Social Security Administration against Colleen Marie Terry.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Des Moines, Iowa, alleges that, from at least September 2013 through at least August 2016, Terry was evaluated by a state agency medical and psychological consultant for her work with the agency. The evaluation, which was conducted in the office of the agency's Director of Clinical Education and Advocacy, found that Terry has the following severe impairments:  osteoarthritis, degenerative disc disease, migraine headaches, post-traumatic stress disorder, and learning disability.  In addition, the complaint alleges that she suffered from a history of anxiety and depression.  According to the complaint, Terry had been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, recurrent major depressive disorder, generalized panic disorder, learning disability, and anxiety disorder.  She was later placed in a nursing home where she had been employed for nearly two years.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Terry's work history included stints as a waitress, a housekeeper, and housekeeper.  On one occasion, Terry complained of severe back pain and a migraine headache.  During the evaluation, the SEC found that the claimant retained the residual functional capacity to perform medium work, but did not have classic symptoms of these impairments.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Complaint or the SEC, Terry consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  Terry agreed to a permanent injunction, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2017.  Separately, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it had hired a consultant to evaluate the effectiveness of certain of its services, including the use of diagnostic tests, to detect signs of impairment, such as hearing loss and dementia.  A hearing exam conducted by the consultant was conducted by Jennifer A. Heckler, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, with the assistance of Scott A. Kasper, and the case was supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley."
