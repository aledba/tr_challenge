  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against Centra Credit, Inc. and its former bookkeeper, Robert S. Summers, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that, in 2013, Kincaid was hired as a bookkeeper and internal accountant at two companies that operated as independent, family-owned and-operated manufacturing and supply businesses.  According to the complaint, the companies' books and records, which were prepared in the company's name, contained a clear line between duty of care and negligence.  For example, the complaint alleges that in one of the cases, when a check was deposited into a company's account, the check was forged, and the check entered into the bank's account.  In another case, the SEC alleges that the company failed to report the forged checks to the company, and instead deposited the checks into its own bank account, thereby causing the company to lose millions of dollars.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Separately, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the companies.  On August 23, 2017, the court granted the Companies' request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the companies, and ordering the companies to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million and $100,000, respectively, to be determined by the court at a later date.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for August 24, 2017. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Indiana Department of Insurance, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and the Indiana Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
