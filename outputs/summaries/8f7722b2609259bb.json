  "summary": "On January 26, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the university and its former head of research, John Gergen, against Gergen.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Gergen violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Gergen and Gergen also agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws.  In addition, Gergen agreed to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public university and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer and director bar.  According to the complaint, the settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, Defendants have consented to permanent injunctions, to pay civil penalties, and to the appointment of a receiver for Gergen & Gergen's violations of Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder of the Exchange Act. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  On March 24, 2020, the court granted the SEC and New York State requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and a conduct-based injunction to prevent Gergen from further violating the anti-discrimination provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and ordered Gergen to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  Separately, the Court granted the request for a preliminary injunction, which is pending approval by a federal district court in New York, on March 26, 2020.  A hearing is scheduled for April 5, 2020 to determine whether to proceed with the administrative proceeding.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-00275 (January 26, 2014).  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Donnelly and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Ms. De Figueroa. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the New York Department of Health and Human Services (DOHA) in this matter."
