  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered final judgments against Michael Frierson, a convicted rapist and a convicted kidnapper, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, Frierson was indicted on three counts of rape and two counts of kidnapping in 1997. The court found that the defendants had been previously convicted of the same offenses, but had been barred from entering the United States as a result of those convictions.  The court also found that Frierson had a prior conviction of a third-degree felony, identified as a \"sexually violent\" offense, and had been ordered deported or removed from the country for trial.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants also had prior felony convictions, which the court found to be unrelated to the alleged crimes.  Frierson also was found not guilty of rape in count one and two of the charges, and the trial court found him guilty of those counts.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Frierson. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, charges Frierson with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The complaint seeks a preliminary injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, and requires him to be barred from participating in the securities industry. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Department of Justice in this matter."
