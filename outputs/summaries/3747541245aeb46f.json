  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment in favor of the Maryland Attorney General's Office's motion to correct an illegal sentence in which he claimed that he had not received the full amount of credit for time during which he was incarcerated before his conviction.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, on August 8, 1983, the court found that Mr. Bratt had been sentenced to two life terms of imprisonment before he was convicted of first degree murder.  The complaint alleges that the court did not impose a new sentence on Bratt because it had not yet imposed a new one on him.  As alleged, Bratt's sentence at the time he filed his 2018 motion was illegal because it was inconsistent with his position on the merits of the case.  In its judgment, the Court of Appeals ruled that the 2017 amendment was not sufficient to correct the illegal sentence, that the prior sentence was unlawful and the new one is lawful.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Bratt also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any such order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of the United States District Judge in Baltimore and has been supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Timothy J. Donahue and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
