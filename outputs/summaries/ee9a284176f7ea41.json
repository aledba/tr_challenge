  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 60 months in prison for disseminating child pornography.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Howard William Halverson, who was previously convicted of child pornography, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(3)(B) and (c) thereunder.  According to the complaint, Halverson was well-educated in computer systems and that he had access to child pornography on two laptops and one hard drive. The complaint alleges that Halverson agreed to a five-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, which means that he would receive the full amount of the victim\u2019s losses by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty.  Halverson also alleges that he did not adequately negotiate with the victims\u2019 attorneys, and did not help authorities open his other two hard drives.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New York announced criminal charges against Halverson.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court agreed to the final judgment, which permanently enjoins Halverson from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $50,317.00, a penalty equal to the amount of his supervised release, and bars him from participating in any online adult-based adult-entertainment promotion or promotion of any child pornography content. The court also granted Halverson a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from associating with anyone with whom he has an attorney, from accessing the internet, and from providing any assistance in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct.  On October 19, 2017, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the New York District Court issued an order suspending Halverson pending the outcome of a court-ordered administrative proceeding. The order also ordered Halverson to pay restitution of $1,409 per image possessed by at least 33 victims, which is a significant reduction from the amount he received at the prior sentencing.  To learn more about supervised release and how to spot signs of a pattern of misconduct, see Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 15(a)(1) and 16(a).  The court's order temporarily suspended Halverson and ordered him to comply with the court order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  A hearing on October 20, 2017 was scheduled for 11:30 a.m."
