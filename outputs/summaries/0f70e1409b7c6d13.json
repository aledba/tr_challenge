  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of manslaughter in 2006.  The court entered the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Kansas City, Missouri, on June 5, 2017.  In its judgment, the court held that, as alleged in the complaint, the defendant was liable for manslaughter in the first degree and a second-degree murder in the second degree, and that, even if it did not qualify as a COV, there was a reasonable probability that the defendant would use force to cause death.  According to the court's order, however, Reyes-Contreras was not a co-defendant and, instead, assisted another person in self-murder.  As the court previously ruled, the defendants were not liable for the same type of harm that resulted from their actions.  For example, the SEC previously ruled that a defendant could be liable for a felony if he knowingly or intentionally applied or attempted to apply force to a crime of which he was not convicted.  On June 9, 2017, the Court issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering a hearing on June 10, 2017 to determine whether to proceed with a sentencing action.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Voisine and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Attorney General's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Criminal Investigations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's Investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced that it filed criminal charges against the defendant for his role in a scheme to commit a series of securities fraud and other securities-related securities fraud.  To learn more about securities fraud, see SEC Litigation Release No. 565-3d 587, 589 n.2(a)(1) and SEC Lit. Lit. Release no. 596-3rd 587 (5th Cir. 2006).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit."
