  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Scott Pelley and The Pelley Family Limited Partnership in an ongoing litigation action against Michael C. Wynne, John Hunter Smith, and others arising out of the dissolution of the law partnership of Nall, Pelley, and Smith.  According to the SEC's order, filed on August 28, 2017, the trial court improperly awarded $55,672.80 to the Wynne parties for attorney's fees incurred in connection with the Gibbs Estate and Shankles Estate cases.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that the court exceeded its mandate in awarding the defendants pre-judgment overhead expenses.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay a total of $76,387.50.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay $19,500 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their fees awarded to the defendants.  Additionally, the judgment imposes joint and several liability as to Wynne's and Smith's counterclaims against the defendants, and requires the parties to pay additional fees in the future.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-15-1, 2017 WL 3699823, at *33. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Office of Financial Regulation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC also issued an investor alert\u00c2\u00a0on July 20, 2018, warning investors to be aware of potential conflicts of interest when making investments in a company or business that is not registered with the SEC."
