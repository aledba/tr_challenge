  "summary": "On November 13, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland entered a final judgment against defendant Warren Schmidt, finding that he was not eligible for a probation before judgment because he had been found guilty of a prior felony.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Montgomery County, Maryland, Mr. Schmidt claimed that the Maryland Department of Mental Health and Hygiene (MDHHS) had the authority to determine whether a defendant could be eligible for an expungement of the underlying guilty finding from his criminal record.  The complaint further alleged that the court found that the MDHHS statute does not apply to defendants found NCR, and instead requires the court to determine the severity of a finding of NCR.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, when a defendant pleads guilty to a felony, he is affirmatively requesting a judgment, albeit of a different nature than the one that exists upon sentencing.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's opinion, the defendant has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Maryland Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Maryland Attorney General's Office in this matter."
