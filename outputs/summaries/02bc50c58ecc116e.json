  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 181 years in prison without parole.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Donnell W. Wilson, a resident of Glen Park, Gary, Indiana, was a \"war zone\" who was under threat of serious injury and death nearly every day.  According to the complaint, Wilson was raised in an urban war zone by his mother, who raised him as an \"active risk taker.\"  The complaint further alleges that Wilson was highly likely to be rehabilitated and would receive consecutive sentences for each murder and robbery conviction.  Wilson was particularly likely to receive a life-without-parole sentence because his mother did not allow her children to play outside and taught them to fall to the floor or go to the basement if they heard gunshots.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Indiana today announced criminal charges against Wilson.  On March 17, 2013, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Wilson to pay a civil penalty of 181 years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, Wilson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a penalty equal to the amount of his sentence.   The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 567 (Dec. 2016).  The case is being handled by Jennifer C. McKinley, John Rymas, and Amy C. Welshhans of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Indiana Department of Justice in this matter."
