  "summary": "On June 4, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty), a self-insured company that paid personal injury protection (PIP) benefits to its insured, that permanently enjoins the company from violating the federal securities laws and requires it to pay a civil penalty in the event of an accident.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 7, 2016, a tractor-trailer truck driven by Albert Kika and a pickup truck driving by Eugene Jerinsky were involved in an automobile accident. The complaint alleges that Kika was negligent and, therefore, entitled to reimbursement of PIP benefits paid on behalf of his insured.  The complaint further alleges that Jerinsky was not required to maintain PIP coverage and, as a result, the amount of reimbursement should be determined in a court proceeding and not at arbitration.  In a parallel action, on July 20, 2018 a federal district court in New Jersey issued an order requiring Liberty to comply with the court's order by consenting to the entry of an order imposing an injunction and requiring the company to provide a copy of the complaint to the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Liberty agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 9.1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any PIP benefit.  Liberty also agreed to pay an $8,500 civil penalty.  Separately, the court granted Liberty's request for an injunction against further violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and ordered Liberty to pay $2,500 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On July 21, 2018 the court issued a temporary restraining order against Kika, ordering him to return his truck to the dealership, and ordering a court to determine whether he is a tortfeasor.  A hearing on July 24, 2018 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Department of Insurance, and the Federal Office of Insurance Regulation."
