  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against FirstEnergy, Ohio Edison Company, Ohio Power Supply Assn., and Toledo Edison Company for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that the Commission improperly approved a third-party monitor to review FirstEnergy's use of the DMR, which is intended to protect ratepayers from possible misuse of DMR funds.  According to the complaint, the Commission failed to adequately consider the impact on ratepayers' financial health when it approved Rider RRS in 2016.  FirstEnergy and the companies have agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the companies.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, FirstEnergy has agreed to a settlement where it will be permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 13(b)(2)(h).  The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Press Release No. 14-1297-EL-SSO (Mar. 31, 2016) and Order No. 13-2385-ML-1 (Feb. 25, 2017).  In its order, the commission also ordered FirstEnergy to submit periodic reports documenting how the companies and FirstEnergy Corporation use the distributed-grid-improvement incentive, and to file a new standard service offer (SSP) with the Commission.  It also ordered the companies to submit quarterly updates to the PUCO staff on how they are performing their distribution-grid modernization efforts, a midterm report in the event that the companies seek to extend the distribution grid beyond its initial three-year term, and a final report within 90 days of the termination of the program.   The Commission's order, which was entered by the court on June 29, 2016, requires the Commission to consider whether a third party monitor should be required to review a DMR before approving an ESP, and requires the commission to consider the financial health of the companies' distribution systems. The Commission also requires the company to provide timely and accurate information about its progress in connection with the implementation of the SSP. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Order"
