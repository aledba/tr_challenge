  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against three Nassau County police officers who were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that, on the morning of October 21, 2009, the defendants entered into a partial judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a $1,000 civil penalty.  According to the complaint, Burris, who was in the hospital at the time of the alleged assault, claimed that he had had a bowel movement the day before, and that the officers had inserted a bullet into his rectum.  As alleged, however, this was not the case.  Burris also allegedly told the court that he did not know that the bullet had been inserted, that it was simply there when he moved his bowels, or to explain how the bullet appeared to move up.  In addition, he claimed that the defendants had told him that they had \"no way to rebut the doctors' testimony\" and that they \"did not believe that this bullet could move up.\"  In fact, according to the SEC's order, the jury found Burris liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress because he had been denied his expert opinion.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws, ordering Burris to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1 million, and ordering the defendants to pay $2.5 million in prejudgment interests.  On the same day, the court granted Burris's motion for a new trial on all of the charged charges, and granted him a temporary restraining order, ordering him to return to the hospital, and requiring him to show cause and effect of a court order appointing him as a receiver of the receiver of receiver of receivers of receiver.  Finally, the Court granted Burrs' motion to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a trial judge, and ordered him to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $2,500 and $2 million, respectively.   The court also ordered Burris not to participate in the pre-judgment proceedings for the purpose of recovering his allegedly injured abdomen and to provide an accounting of his alleged injuries. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Baxi, N.Y. State Attorney General, and was supervised by Eric R. Werner. "
