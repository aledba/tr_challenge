  "summary": "On December 14, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia entered a final judgment against the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that the Virginia Secretary of State's Office issued an order suspending driver's licenses for failure to pay court fines and costs.  According to the complaint, the order temporarily suspended the licenses of three Virginia residents who had their licenses suspended for nonpayment of court fines or costs, and ordered them to pay a $145 reinstatement fee.  In a parallel action, the Virginia Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against two Virginia residents for their roles in the suspension of their licenses.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of up to $1,000.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  On December 16, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the Commissioner of Virginia, charging him with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Section\u00c2\u00a010(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 5b2-1, and ordering him to pay $145 in disgorgement, $45 in pre-judgment interest and a civil penalty of $145, which is equal to the amount of his or her civil penalty.   The complaint also charges the Commissioner with violating Section 15(a)(2)(A) and (c) of Securities Exchange Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against him.  Finally, the complaint seeks a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 15a-22 of the Exchange Act and Rule 15b-3 thereunder; a permanent officer and director bar against each defendant; and, in a related administrative proceeding, a permanent injunction against any violation of the securities laws. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Conte and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Virginia Office of Insurance Regulation."
