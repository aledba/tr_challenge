  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado today announced criminal charges against a former probation violator for failing to pay restitution.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Ruth Cheryl Williams, who was previously incarcerated for failure to pay her restitution, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 18-1.3-702(3)(c) of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Williams was sentenced to a four-year deferred judgment and sentenced to two years of probation, to be supervised by the probation department.  Williams subsequently missed several restitution payments, and the court revoked the deferred judgment.  As alleged, Williams's probation officer testified that Williams had indeed missed multiple payments but acknowledged that Williams was searching for a job, had an overdue home energy bill of about $3,000 and owed about $8,000 to a credit union, and had purportedly been trying to sell her belongings to make the restitution payments.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Williams consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains her from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws, and orders her to pay a penalty equal to the amount due to her inability to pay.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0report\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's\u00c2\u00a0success\u00c2\u00a0find\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0insufficient evidence to justify a revocation of probation.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert on\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission\u00c2\u00a0conduct\u00c2\u00a0that encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by\u00c2\u00a0using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.
