  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against defendants in a securities fraud case brought by victims of the 1994 Northridge earthquake.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 28, 2012, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, the defendants and their law firms violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose to the victims that they had received settlement checks from a defendant who had failed to fully and properly distribute $22 million of the settlement proceeds.  In addition, the complaint alleges defendants did not inform the victims of their misappropriation of settlement proceeds until they discovered that the settlement had been improperly allocated to them.  As alleged in the complaint, the victims' claims were based upon speculation and were not supported by the facts presented to the court.  For example, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys allegedly made a presentation explaining how the defendants had committed wrongful acts and that their informed consent to the settlement was not obtained until the defendant made the allocation determinations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $20,000, $10,000 and $1,500, respectively, to be determined by the court at a later date.  On October 14, 1998, the court entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants, ordering them to preserve client records for at least five years, and ordering them not to discuss the settlement with anyone until the court had determined that sufficient facts were sufficient to determine whether defendants had breached their fiduciary duty.  A hearing on October 19, 2018, was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael Prakashpalan and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Angela Britton. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the California Office of the Attorney General."
