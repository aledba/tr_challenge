  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered final judgments against Brian J. Sweeney and Deborah E. Sweeney in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 25, 2018, filed in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, the trial court found that Brian had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that the court erred in failing to determine whether Brian was voluntarily underemployed and whether he was capable of earning four percent on his child support obligations.  In addition, the court ruled that Brian could and should have been making a four percent interest income on the $530,000 he deposited in a savings and checking account where he continued to pay her child support.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Brian consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $'90,080, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The final judgment also prohibits Brian from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a shared-parenting plan. The court also ordered Brian to pay $'20,000 in interest and a $'50,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and Glenn S. Gordon in the Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Brian J., supervised by Amy C. Barry, and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit in the Chicago Regional Office, and the case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Regional Director of the Ohio Department of Banking and Securities. The investigation was assisted by Scott A. Mascianica of the Boston Regional Office under the supervision of John R. Kasper. The trial court will determine the amount of child support owed to Brian by the court at a later date. The matter of whether Brian is entitled to an exemption from the federal child support laws is being handled by the Ohio Secretary of State's Office, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Ohio Attorney General's Office."
