  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against defendant Adam Richard Carey, Jr., finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 14-288 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14-5 thereunder.  The court also found that, contrary to the court\u2019s finding, defendant had abandoned his challenge to his conviction for impersonating a law enforcement officer and instead used various rules of statutory construction to determine whether a \"flash bang\" grenade was a weapon of mass death and destruction.  According to the Court of Appeals\u2019 order, the defendants had failed to elicit sufficient evidence to establish that any such grenade was capable of causing serious or catastrophic deaths and destruction, and that, in the event that a \u201cflash bang\u201d grenade was used for its intended purpose, it would cause catastrophic damage and destruction to the people in that room.  In addition, the court found that defendant had not engaged in a reasonable search of the vehicle and, instead, used a search tool to find, among other things, an emergency medical technician's badge; a number of firearms, including several handguns and rifles with suppressors; and a pair of fake AK-47s.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of any company or entity that requires it to comply with certain federal laws, including the securities laws.  On May 17, 2019, the Honorable Kathleen M. McCole granted the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order against Carey, ordering him to surrender his firearm, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against him.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Secret Service, the FBI, and the U.K. Secret Service in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage people to check the background of anyone selling or offering them a security deposit using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov."
