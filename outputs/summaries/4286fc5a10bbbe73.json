  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New York City Police Department officer who was charged with insider trading in the wake of the July 17, 2014 death of Eric Garner.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on December 18, 2014 in federal court in Manhattan, Daniel Pantaleo, of Schenectady, New York, was the officer in the green jersey depicted in the highly-publicized video of Garner's arrest who engaged Garner from behind and brought him to the ground. The complaint alleges that, based on the above and release of CCRB records, the officer was not on notice of the disciplinary action taken against him and could not be disclosed without the officer's consent or by court order.  The complaint further alleges that the officer engaged Garner in a similar conduct and was disciplined in varying degrees.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced that it filed an emergency action on July 24, 2014, seeking a court order requiring the release of a summary of officer disciplinary actions and disciplinary actions. The court granted the court's request for a temporary restraining order, a cease-and-desist order, and an asset freeze. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center by the New York Regional Office. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Justine Luongo and supervised by Lara S. Mehraban."
