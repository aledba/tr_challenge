  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against The Counseling Center, Inc., a New Mexico-based managed care organization, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that, on January 10, 2014, a federal district court in New Mexico issued an order suspending the implementation of a new, one-hundred percent audit rule that requires providers to report overpayments to the agency.  According to the complaint, the court improperly shifted the burden of proof to the provider to prove that the overpayment had been corrected.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New Mexico announced criminal charges against the provider.   The complaint alleges that the court violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, TCC consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws, orders it to pay a civil penalty of $5,264.24, and requires it to comply with the reporting requirements of Section 206(3).  The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Health and Human Services, with the assistance of the Enforcement Division's Analysis and Detection Center. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Mexico Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Arizona Department of Banking, Securities and Exchange Commission."
