  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio today entered a final judgment finding that Stevens Engineers & Constructors, a construction company, owes withdrawal liability to the fund for work that was not performed within its jurisdiction.  The court also found that Stevens was not liable for work performed outside the jurisdiction of the fund.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dayton, Ohio on October 4, 2016, Stevens violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1383(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that, contrary to these representations, Stevens did not owe withdrawal liability because he had assigned the work to other members of the same union.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Stevens arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Stevens consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $5,056,017, the amount of his ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $7,500. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and Carol S. Cotter of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Department of Insurance, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office.
