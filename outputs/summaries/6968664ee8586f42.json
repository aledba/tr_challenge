  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 42 months in prison for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dayton, Ohio, alleges that Jesse Lee Hagan entered a guilty plea to a felony sexual battery charge on May 10, 2018. The complaint alleges that the trial court incorrectly informed Hagan that he would be subject to a mandatory community notification requirement as part of a Tier III sex offender sentencing.  According to the complaint, Hagan consented to the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The final judgment, which permanently enjoins Hagan from violating the federal securities laws, orders Hagan to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $3,500, plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $500,000 civil penalty. Hagan has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to a five-year officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Hagan arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  On June 14, 2018, a federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, entered a judgment in favor of Hagan, finding him liable for a total of 42 months of incarceration. The court also issued a temporary restraining order, which prohibits Hagan's entry of a judgment against himself or a company he controls, from making material misrepresentations to the court regarding the nature of the charges and the amount of his sentence. The SEC also issued an order suspending Hagan for five years.  A hearing on June 20, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. for the sentencing of Hahn.   The court's order temporarily suspended Hahn from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The hearing was conducted in the absence of any evidence or evidence to support the SEC's findings. The case was supervised by Amy C. McKinley, Chief of the Ohio Division of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry."
