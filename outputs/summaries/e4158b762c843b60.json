  "summary": "On March 2, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Yomaira Valle, a Puerto Rican who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, Valle was initially diagnosed with a range of physical and mental impairments, including depression and anxiety, back pain and sciatica, migraines, carpal tunnel syndrome, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  The complaint alleges that Valle initially alleged that she suffered from a severe impairment, including severe back pain, and that she had had knee surgery in September 2017.  Valle's family physician, Remya Tharackal Ravindran, indicated in a September 2016 report that she could not perform routine work without stopping her medication.  In addition, according to the complaint, she had recently had surgery on her right knee that relieved her pain.  On November 28, 2018, the SEC issued an order requiring Valle to comply with a court order requiring her to consent to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and requires her to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint filed in federal district court in New York, the court granted the court's order and granted Valle the right to respond to the court order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Ms. Valle and Ms. Javorski.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Department of Health, and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
