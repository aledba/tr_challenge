  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Papst Licensing GMBH & Co. KG, a Texas-based manufacturer of digital cameras, on a motion for a temporary restraining order.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, Texas on August 1, 2018, Papst filed a complaint alleging that the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) had improperly concluded that all of the asserted claims in the IPR patents were unpatentable.  The complaint further alleges that, as a result of the PTO's finding, the Camera Manufacturers were unable to obtain a court-ordered injunction to halt the litigation.  In its complaint, which was unsealed yesterday, the SEC alleges that Papst violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the Court should consider granting a stay of proceedings until the litigation is resolved.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders Papst to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and imposes a $25,000 bar on Papst.  Papst has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction, to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2.5 million.  On June 20, 2017, the court granted Papst's request for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval, and granted the company's request to have the injunction halted pending the outcome of the litigation at a later date.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Commerce, and the Texas Office of Patent Education and Advocacy (DOEA) in this matter."
