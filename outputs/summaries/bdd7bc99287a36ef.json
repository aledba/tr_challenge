  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts announced today that it has obtained an emergency court order to disqualify a former Massachusetts state senator from appearing before the SEC as an attorney.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, alleges that, as an elected state senator, Brian Joyce attempted to exploit his official position for private gain in multiple corrupt schemes.  According to the complaint, as a State Senator, Joyce engaged in a series of schemes in which he solicited the services of an energy insurance brokerage company to facilitate or conceal the alleged misconduct. The complaint alleges that Joyce enlisted the assistance of his personal attorney, Brian O'Rourke, to submit a backdated coffee invoice and check to the SEC, and then used the attorney's advice to convince the agency to issue a subpoena to him.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Western Districts of Massachusetts today entered a temporary restraining order against Joyce, ordering him to comply with the court's order.  On June 2, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court of Common Pleas granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of The Securities Act of 1933. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  To learn more about attorney disqualification, see Litigation Release No. 571, 572, (1st Cir. 1997).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant a former attorney who has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the bar and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, a $25,000 bar, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Joyce agreed to the issuance of a subpoena pursuant to Section 5 of the Exchange Act. The court granted the government's motion for a hearing in which it will determine whether or not to revoke the subpoena. The Court also granted the motion for an in-camera review, which is subject to court approval. The case is being handled by Gregory P. Violette, Kelly L. Gibson, and Amy S. Cotter of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
