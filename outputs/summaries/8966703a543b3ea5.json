  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Emily Usnick, a mother of three who was convicted of first-degree involuntary manslaughter for the death of her newborn daughter during an at-home, medically unattended birth.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Elizabeth, Missouri, Usnick gave birth to her daughter on January 15, 2009, while at home alone. The complaint alleges that Usnick was found by police with her umbilical cord wrapped around her neck and unable to secure assistance and medical attention for the child following birth. The SEC alleges that the baby's body was found in a plastic bag and container, and the baby was placed in it shortly after birth.

On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans granted the court's motion for a temporary restraining order against Usnick and ordered her to return to the United States to be sentenced to five years in prison. The court also granted the Court's request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.
