  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment finding that the Oklahoma Corporation Commission improperly withheld funding to be provided to Dobson Telephone Company d/b/a McLoud Telephone Company for costs incurred to relocate its telephone facilities as required by the city of Oklahoma City for a street-widening project.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Dobson sought reimbursement, under Subsection (K)(1)(b) of the OUSF, for costs related to the relocation of telephone facilities. The complaint alleges that the Commission improperly delayed approving the request for reimbursement because it did not have sufficient evidence to determine whether the expenses were necessary to provide primary universal services to customers in rural, insular, and high-cost areas.  The complaint further alleges that Dobson failed to prove that the expenses incurred by Dobson were as a result of a state government mandate, and that the amount of the reimbursement was reasonable and just.  Dobson's request was denied on the basis of the Commission's finding that it was not authorized to pay for the relocation costs.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC charged Dobson with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Dobson.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson and Ms. Thompson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Oklahoma Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
