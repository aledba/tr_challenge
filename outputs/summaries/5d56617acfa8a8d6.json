  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against Gary Contracting and Trucking Company, LLC (hereinafter GCTC) and its owner, Gary Boryczka, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 21, 2013, the court entered a judgment that permanently restated the previously-issued Finden test for motion to vacate judgments entered pursuant to Rule 60.02(f) and (c) of rule 60.03(b) in November 2017.  The complaint alleges that GCTc and BORYczka failed to timely file a confession of judgment in the amount of $51,824.31, which was the default judgment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York today announced criminal charges against Gctc. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Buck Blacktop, alleging that he violated the four-part test, which requires a court to determine whether a defendant has a reasonable excuse for failure or neglect to answer, whether there is a reasonable basis justifying relief from the operation of the judgment, and whether the court has a duty to grant a hearing or order a new trial.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to those imposed by the court, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $15,612.81. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2018, a federal district court in Minnesota issued a judgment in favor of the defendants. The court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, and ordered the parties to pay civil penalties of $10,000 each.  A hearing on June 25, 2019, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time. The hearing was delayed until after the district court administrator entered the judgment on June 24, 2017. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Minnesota Division of Criminal Justice. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Minnesota Attorney General's Office, and the Minnesota Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
