  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against the university and its doctors for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that the Florida Department of Health and Human Services and Jackson Memorial Hospital violated Sections 768.28(9)(b) and 768.29(10)(f), of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the defendants were not entitled to immunity from liability under those provisions because they were not state actors subject to state control.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of the expanded immunity, the university was not liable for any liability arising out of the treatment of non-paying patients.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Vallecillo and Bean consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins the defendants from violating the charged provisions of the state securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $50,000 per occurrence.  Additionally, the court granted the university's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, and ordered the university to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  On May 9, 2016, the U. S. District Judge for the Central District of Miami entered a judgment against Valleciunas and Bean, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering the college to pay $50 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interests.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Florida Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Florida Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
