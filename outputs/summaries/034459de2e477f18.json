  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Syntel Best Shores Mauritius Limited and Syntel, Inc. (collectively, \"Syntel\").  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges Syntel with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and injunctive relief.  The complaint also alleges that Syntel failed to produce documents relevant to the discovery of the alleged misappropriation of documents.  According to the complaint, the SEC's order, which was entered on June 29, 2016, required Syntel to produce at least 1,500 documents, 7,533 of which had not been produced.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Syntel consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins it from violating the discovery provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3)(b)(2)(A), and orders it to produce all of the documents requested in the complaint.  In addition, the court granted the SEC the right to request a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the amount of money that has been spent on the discovery, as well as a civil penalty.  On May 24, 2018, the Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn, LLP (\"Honigman\"), a New York law firm, entered an Order suspending Syntel from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering it to provide a copy of the discovery order to a court-appointed receiver.   The court also ordered the SEC to conduct a preliminary examination of the matter and to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify the imposition of any sanctions.  Finally, the Court granted the request for a preliminary injunction, and ordered the issuance of an order requiring the destruction of any documents that may have been requested by the SEC in violation of Rule 5(b)(5).  The Court also ordered that the SEC and the SEC conduct an independent examination of all of these matters, including the adequacy of the evidence, the accuracy of the findings, and the conduct of the investigation.  Additionally, the order requires that the court determine whether or not to impose any civil penalties against the parties.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018.  Separately, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants."
