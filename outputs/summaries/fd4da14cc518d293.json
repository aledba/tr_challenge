  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming today entered a final judgment in favor of the Washakie County Assessor's 2014 notices of assessment, which classified the properties as agricultural land.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Wyoming, on March 9, 2014, the Assessor issued notices of assessments for four parcels of land, each around 160 acres in size, that classified each property as agricultural.  The complaint alleges that, in each case, the property was leased and grazed prior to and through the assessment period.  As alleged in the complaint, the properties were not fully utilized and did not generate sufficient revenue to qualify for agricultural land status under Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7'39-13-103(b)(x)(B)(IV) and the Department of Revenue's (D.A.R.D.D.) Agricultural Land Valuation Study.  In its order, the court found that the county board improperly determined that taxpayers had satisfied the four statutory requirements for agriculture land, that the properties had exceeded their lease revenue, and that the property had exceeded its capacity to produce agricultural products.  Without admitting or denying the court's findings, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,288.28, prejudgment interest of $2,038.71, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the Denver Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wyoming Secretary of State's Office, the U. S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations Division, the Utah Office of Inspector General, the State Attorney General's Office Criminal Investigation Division and the Wyoming Office of Financial Regulation."
