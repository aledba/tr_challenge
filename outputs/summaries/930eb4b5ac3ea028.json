  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma yesterday entered a final judgment against a convicted felon for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, alleges that Stephen Craig Burnett violated the due process provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933.  According to the complaint, Mr. Burnett, who was incarcerated in Oklahoma at the time of his conviction, entered into a plea for a sentence of life with the possibility of parole on the basis of his prior felony conviction.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, however, his plea agreement expressly stated that he had a right to a fixed set of parole criteria and that he would not spend the rest of his life in prison.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, based on the nature of his criminal history, Burnett failed to show a significant risk of an increased duration of incarceration under the new parole process.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Burnett consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000.   The court also granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, which will be instituted against Burnett upon his motion for a hearing in the future. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, and the Oklahoma State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
