  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by a former geologist who alleges that he was discriminated and retaliated against based on his political affiliation.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Vincennes, Indiana, Peter Daza, a geologist with the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) who was hired as the district's Safety Director in 2011, learned that one of Daza\u2019s supervisees had posted political statements on his private Facebook page. Daza alleges that Daza was consistently passed over for promotions because of his connections to the Democratic party.  Daza also alleges that his mother sent him a letter to the editor criticizing a Republican governor.  The complaint alleges that the day after Daza complained to his supervisor, Brent Schmitt, telling him he had been nominated for a bonus based on their recent work performance, Daza replied, \u201cI feel disrespected by an interviewer who had texted during the interview.\u201d  In a parallel action, the federal district court for the southern district of Indiana yesterday entered final judgments against Daza and Schmitt on all of the charges.  In its order, the court entered a temporary restraining order against all defendants and ordered Daza to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Dazaines has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The court also granted summary judgment against all the defendants on the basis of their actions.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas and Eric Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner.
