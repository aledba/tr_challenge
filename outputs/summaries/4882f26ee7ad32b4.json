  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Texas resident Charles Robert Ransier, Jr. on two counts of attempted tampering with evidence.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston on July 8, 2019, Rrsier consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Ritcherson and Justin J. McCluskey of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Attorney General's Office, and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a real estate investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against Rorsier.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that, in the course of its investigation, R. Robert R. Sansone, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, aided and abetted Rrspera's violations of Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, RRSpera agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction, which would prohibit him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any controlled substance, including, without limitation, the possession of a controlled substance. The court also agreed to a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from associating with any third party, including a law enforcement agency, from making or selling any offer to sell or offer a security deposit in the name of a company or a government agency.  RSD also agreed with the court's finding that RRSPera violated Section 15a of the Exchange Act and Rules 15b-20, 13b-1, 13a-11, and 13b2-1 thereunder and to the imposition of a civil monetary penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
