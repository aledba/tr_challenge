  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of construction company Construction Systems, Inc. (d/b/a Construction Systems of Minnesota) in a civil action brought by construction company FagelHaber, LLC (n/k/a Thompson Coburn LLP), alleging that Construction Systems failed to timely record a lien on its mechanic's lien when it filed its complaint in 2005.  According to the court's order, Construction Systems paid $1,321,200 in attorney fees for services related to the lien, including drafting an amended counterclaim that alleged that construction Systems had a de facto contract with the owner and construction manager when it failed to serve the required statutory notice.  The court also denied Construction Systems' motion to compel Berres to produce the documents.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Construction Systems.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, charges Construction Systems with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, construction Systems has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a $1.4 million civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  Construction Systems has also agreed to pay $2.2 million in attorney-client fees to settle the litigation, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $3,146,200. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
