  "summary": "On March 29, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Chris Gaubatz, a former Special Investigations Special Agent with the Air Force, for his role in an alleged conspiracy to steal documents from CAIR.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that, among other things, that, in 2011, Gaubat and his co-defendant, Paul Sperry, made false statements to the court regarding the use and disclosure of audio clips relevant to CAIR's alleged ties to terrorism and/or other alleged criminal conduct.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2011 and 2012, David Zimmerman and Harold C. Weatherman III made false and misleading statements in support of the defendants' claims that CAIR was a legitimate civil rights organization and had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.  According to the complaint, in 2012 and 2013, ChrisGaubatz was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $150,000.  Additionally, the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, which is subject to court approval.  On May 22, 2018 the Honorable Paul G. Kerstetter of the United States District Court in Manhattan issued an order requiring the defendants to comply with the court's order, ordering them to provide a copy of the Judgment, which was issued on May 24, 2013, to the SEC as well as to the parties' compliance with the reporting and preservation provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and ordering that the defendants be barred from appearing or practicing before the court as part of a settled administrative proceeding. The court also ordered the SEC to provide an accounting of all of the alleged violations of Section 5(b).  The complaint also named David Zimmerman as counsel for the parties, and Adam Savit as a defendant for the purpose of corroborating the allegations in the complaint.  David Zimmerman has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related documents, including any documents that may be deemed relevant to the case. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
