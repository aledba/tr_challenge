  "summary": "On November 19, 1863, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against New York City officials from destroying documents related to the IDNYC program.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, on December 5, 2016, the New York State Department of Health and Human Resources (HHS) and Department of Social Services (DSS) issued an order requiring the destruction and destruction of all documents in connection with New York's identity card program. The order also required that the Department of Homeland Security and DSS maintain records of all applicants.  The complaint alleges that HHS failed to comply with the requirements of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and failed to provide any reasonable basis for the destruction or destruction of the documents.  In a parallel action, on January 13, 2017, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against two individuals for their roles in the scheme.  On January 20, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, charging them with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The SEC's Complaint charges the defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (d) of\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0Adviser's Rules of Practice (Advisers) and Rule\u00c2\u00a010b2 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and orders the destruction of any remaining documents. The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  HHS has also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
