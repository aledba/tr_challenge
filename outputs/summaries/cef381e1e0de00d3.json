  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered final judgments in a civil injunctive action against the Department of Public Works (DPW) and its former Management and Program Analyst, Jeffrey Dickerson, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbia, alleges that, from 2004 through 2014, Dickerson was subjected to disparate treatment based on race and a racially hostile work environment while working for DPW. According to the complaint, as a result of this conduct, he was not entitled to compensation based on his race or national origin, nor was he entitled to an attorney's fee. In addition, the complaint alleges that Dickerson complained that his supervisor Adams made race-based comments, including that he needed to take a cultural awareness class because he \"did not know how to talk to blacks.\" The complaint further alleges that Mr. Dickerson's supervisor Adams had raised questions and complaints about the quality of technical support provided by the DPW's external affairs staff. The complaint also alleges that in asserting his membership in a protected class, the District ordered DPW to pay him attorney's fees in the amount of $66,696, which is less than half the amount that he was entitled to in a prior case. The court also issued a temporary restraining order halting the issuance of the final judgments.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Dickerson. The SEC also announced that it filed an emergency action against DPW, charging it with a pattern of conduct that it had not followed through with its prior order.  According to a complaint filed in the SEC's Division of Enforcement, the Office of Inspector General's Office (OIG) has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Compliance has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint Bulletin\u00c2\u00a0in which it encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0reporting tool to identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0OIG has also issued an Investor Alert about potential conflicts of interest arising out of this matter.  Investors should be aware that\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's Complaint Bulletin has a history of violations of the anti-discrimination provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c).\u00c2\u00a0In this case, the SEC"
