  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Mid-Wilshire Health Care Center and its former principal, Betty Aguilar, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that, on March 17, 2009, Aguilar and Aguilar violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the complaint, the arbitration provision in the collective bargaining agreement does not apply to Mendez's claims.  Instead, the complaint alleges that Aguilar agreed to arbitrate her claims without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint.  In a parallel action, on November 19, 2010, a federal district court in San Diego entered an order suspending Aguilar from appearing before the court as an impartial arbitrator in a case that was being handled by the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA).  The court's order temporarily enjoins the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On March 24, 2016, the court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order and entered a default judgment against Aguilar.  This order also prohibits the parties from imposing any monetary penalty or imposing a civil penalty against the defendants.  A hearing scheduled for March 26, 2018, was not scheduled for that date, and the defendants have agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws, order them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains, and order the defendants to pay civil penalties of up to $1 million.  Aguilar has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions, ordering him to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty, and ordering Aguilar to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  At a hearing on November 26, 2013, the SEC filed an emergency action, including an order freezing the assets of the defendants, charging them with violations of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"), and Rule 206 with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction against future violations and an order requiring the parties to comply with federal and state laws.   The"
