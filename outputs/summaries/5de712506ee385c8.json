  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Santa Ana Redevelopment Agency (RDA) and its successor agency (Housing Fund) in a civil injunctive action brought by the California Department of Finance (DOF).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Santa Ana, California, alleges that the RDA was not enforceable under the federal and state constitutions.  The complaint alleges that, in 1984 and 1994, the state passed a law requiring redevelopment agencies to set aside certain percentages of tax increment funds for development of low- and moderate-income housing.  According to the complaint, RDA funds were not used to construct any homes.  In addition, in 2011, the California Attorney General's Office (\"DOF\") issued an order requiring the county auditor-controller to determine whether a certain percentage of the tax increment money should be allocated to the successor agency.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the DFO's order required that the amount of any additional tax increment be determined by the court at a later date.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the District of Columbia Court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins RDA from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders RDA to pay $33.2 million in interest and a $3.5 million civil penalty.  RDA has agreed to a settlement where it will be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal, state, and local securities laws.  It has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $25,000, which is equal to the amount that it will pay to the receiver of the property.  Additionally, the settlement requires that RDA pay a $2,337,191 civil penalty, which the court found to be excessive and unreasonable.  Among other things, the court also ordered RDA not to exceed $30,593,530 in pre-judgment interest, which was deemed reasonable by the district attorney at the time of the court's order.  Finally, the SEC alleges that in 2011 and 2012, the Santa Ana County Auditor-Controller issued a judgment requiring the city to maintain a $4.7 million \"Peebler Fund\" for low- to moderate income housing, and that in 2013, the Auditor Controller issued a similar order requiring that the city maintain a separate $32 million civil asset fund for the purpose of providing low-to-moderate income housing. The court found RDA violated the contract provisions of Sections 336(1), 336(2), and 336(4)"
