  "summary": "On March 1, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona entered a final judgment in favor of the Navajo Nation, a federally recognized Indian tribe located on the reservation of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah.  The court granted the tribe's request for a preliminary injunction and ordered it to submit an annual renewal application for a $15.8 million federal grant.  According to the court's order, filed on February 21, 2018 and unsealed on March 24, 2018 in the United States District Court in Phoenix, Arizona, the tribe has received $23,075,043 from the Department of Health and Human Services for Head Start and Early Head Start programs for young children and their families since March 2015.  As alleged in the complaint, the federal grant is not static from year to year and is not subject to any significant reduction in funding.  For example, the complaint alleges that, in fiscal year 2016, the reservation had approximately $6.3 million in unobligated Head Start funds, which it obligated only $17.4 million of $23.1 million awarded to the tribe.  In fiscal year 2018, according to the reservation's self-reported enrollment figures, that number was less than the number of students eligible to fill the approximately 180 to 200 additional seats funded by the funding decision.   The Navajo Nation's complaint, filed in federal court in Arizona, charges the federal government with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the government has consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $15,8 million, and ordering a temporary restraining order against the tribe from violating those provisions. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.  This matter was investigated by the Office of Inspector General of the Arizona Department of Education and the Division of Justice's Office of Criminal Investigations, which also conducted an examination of the matter. The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Hershfang. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Arizona Secretary of State's Office, and the Arizona Attorney General's Office in this matter."
