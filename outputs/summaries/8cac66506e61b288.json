  "summary": "On August 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a temporary restraining order against Florence Mallet and her son Sebastien Kamyab, who are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Mallet has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to place in escrow the net proceeds of the pending sale of her home in Chester County, Pennsylvania, and requiring her to pay for her son's college tuition, gas and maintenance for his family's cars, and travel including a plane ticket from St. Louis to Philadelphia for his son's girlfriend. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, alleges that Mallet misappropriated significant company funds for personal use and paid extravagant expenses to her son in connection with his work for Airganics, a Novatek subsidiary.  Mallet also allegedly used company funds to pay personal expenses such as college tuition and gas for her family's car, and to make a $2,500 plane ticket for his girlfriend.  According to the complaint, Mallet's personal spending from corporate funds was excessive and grossly disproportional to their own respective personal spending.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mallet.  Separately, the SEC filed a related civil injunctive action in federal court in Pennsylvania.  The SEC previously charged Mallet in a similar action in which she was found liable for violations of Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants agreed to settle the matter by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On August 13, 2018 the U-S District Court in Philadelphia entered a preliminary injunction against Mallett and Kamyaban, ordering Mallet to place into escrow all of her assets pending the court's approval of the final judgment. The court granted the preliminary injunction on August 20, 2018 and the civil injunctions on August 23, 2018. The final judgment on August 24, 2018 is pending final approval by the Court of Appeals for the Second and Third Circuits of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
