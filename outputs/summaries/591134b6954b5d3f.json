  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Century Indemnity Company, a reinsurance company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, on September 30, 2019, a jury found for Utica Mutual Insurance Company that it was liable for a $6 million default judgment for its breach of contract claims.  According to the complaint, the jury found Utica liable for the default judgment because it had improperly allocated pre-judgment interest to certain reinsurance certificates the company issued in the 1970s.   The complaint further alleges that the jury was not asked to determine whether the default allocation was reasonable because it was based on evidence presented to the jury.  In addition, the complaint alleges that a jury could not determine whether a defendant had acted in bad faith in making the judgment based on the evidence presented in the jury's opinion.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Century consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to those imposed by the court on the parties.  Additionally, the court granted a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $2.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively, to be determined by a jury at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of the United States District Judge in Manhattan and the case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission in this matter."
