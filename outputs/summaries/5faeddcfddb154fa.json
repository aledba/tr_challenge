  "summary": "On October 31, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against the former municipal police officer of the Northern Berks Regional Police Department (NBRPD).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Berks County, Pennsylvania, alleges that, in September 2016, the NBRPD terminated the officer's access to JNET, CLEAN, and PennDOT's system. According to the complaint, Hobart, through his union, used JNET to search and print out driver's license photographs of women in undress. The complaint further alleges that Hobart failed to comply with an arbitrator's finding that he exceeded his authorization of official-use operating systems, including the Pennsylvania Justice Network (JNET) and the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Assistance Network (CLEAN). Hobart was subsequently suspended from the department and ordered to pay a four-day suspension.  The complaint charges Hobart with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. Hobart has agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General in this matter."
