The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami-Dade County, Florida, alleges that, between May 13 and May 25, 2015, Robert Nicholl, a resident of Orange County, California, and David Brown, a Kansas resident, made false and misleading statements in a closed Facebook group that targeted Florida residents.

This amended complaint also alleges that Nicholl violated the mandatory reporting provision of Section 5 of the Florida securities laws and that Brown violated the reporting provision under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and aiding and abetting violations of Section 13 of the Commission on Securities and Exchange Act Section 12(a) and Rule 13b3-1 thereunder and the reporting provisions of Rule 13d-1 and 13c-3 thereunder under Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder; and that the complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, disgorg"
