According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on January 24, 2015, Alfred Joiner, a former employee of Ceco Concrete Construction, Inc., filed an application for adjustment of claim under the Workers' Compensation Act of 1940. The complaint alleges that, in July 2015, the Commission entered an order requiring the claimant to file an appeal bond pursuant to Section 19(f)(2) of the Commission's order for the payment of compensation.  The complaint further alleges that the claimant failed to file a brief in compliance with the order.  In a parallel action, on January 26, 2016, a federal district court in Cook County, Illinois, entered a judgment against the claimant that permanently enjoins him from violating the bond provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay $64,000 in attorney fees to three attorneys who had represented him at various times during the Commission proceedings.

A hearing on March 5, 2019 was scheduled for 9:00 a.m. for the Commission to consider the merits of the complaint. The hearing followed by a hearing on June 24, 2010, when the Commission issued its final judgment ordering the settlement of the claim for $320,000. The Commission's final judgment, which was entered without prejudice to the claimant, ordered the settlement to be subject to court approval. The final judgment also ordered the defendant to pay a portion of the settlement proceeds as attorney fees, and the settlement amount to be determined by the court upon motion by the claimant.
