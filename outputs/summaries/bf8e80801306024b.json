  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment against a South Dakota mother and her five children for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ida County, South Dakota, on May 22, 2018, the mother and five children were removed from their mother's care prior to a hearing to terminate her parental rights.  The complaint alleges that the mother sought a continuance of the termination hearing until she was able to present her evidence at the end of the hearing.  As alleged in the complaint, the court granted the mother\u2019s request to participate in the entire hearing by telephone, but only to present a transcript or other record that she was unable to refute due to the limitations on her ability to participate.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, however, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from violating Section 5(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the mother.  To learn more about due process and due process, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.  This case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U. S. Attorney\u2019S Office for the Eastern District of South Dakota."
