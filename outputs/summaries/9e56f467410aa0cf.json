  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in favor of the agency's recommendation to recirculate a draft environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Westside Subway Extension project.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the agency from issuing any additional orders or orders related to the EIS/EIR.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, the agency failed to recur its findings from its prior studies on the subject.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Metro failed to adequately analyze the potential environmental impacts of tunneling under the high school and elsewhere, and failed to provide timely and accurate information about the potential risks associated with tunneling.  As alleged in the complaint, Metro's EIS-EIR, which was developed in conjunction with the MTA's fault investigation, did not adequately consider the potential impact on the school's ability to construct other structures on the campus.  Instead, the report alleges that the agency relied entirely on uncorroborated hearsay, and that it failed to analyze localized air quality impacts or the public health impacts of the project's construction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's order, the SEC and MTA have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and injunctive relief.  On May 24, 2012, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the United States Court of Appeals for the Central District of Los Angeles granted the SEC request for a writ of mandamus, ordering the issuance of an order requiring the agency to conduct a full and fair hearing on the matter, and imposing a $1.5 million civil penalty.  A hearing on May 25, 2012 was scheduled for 5:30 p.m.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC examination that led to the investigation was supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Ms. Curt. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
