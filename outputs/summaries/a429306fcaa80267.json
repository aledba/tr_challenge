  "summary": "On August 22, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against Kenneth Goldberg, his company, Creative Oil & Gas, LLC, and four other individuals for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that from 1976 to 2011, Kenneth Goldberg co-owned and operated a scrap-metal recycling company called Gold Metal Recyclers. In 2011, Goldberg sold Gold Metal to EMR Holdings for over $100 million. According to the complaint, before he left Gold Metal, Goldberg signed confidentiality agreements promising not to use any of the company's trade secrets or proprietary information for the benefit of any person other than Plaintiffs. The complaint alleges that before Gold Metal went into business, Goldberg and his company hired some of the same people who had gone to work for Gold Metal for the purchase and sale of scrap metal. The SEC alleges that Goldberg violated his duty to protect the interests of all of these individuals by failing to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he violated the federal securities laws, including the right to a fair and impartial jury trial, and the duty to provide due process and impartiality to the parties involved in the case. The court also denied the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Goldberg, Applebaum, Jackson, and Myers for their roles in the alleged violations of the anti-fraud provision of Section 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(2)(A) of The Securities Act of 1933 and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Dyer and Ms. Messina. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.
