  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a Texas Department of Family and Protective Services employee who was terminated for failing to comply with a court-ordered service plan.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that, from at least May 2017 through August 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) became involved with Mother and her children when Mother left the children alone at the Haven for Hope shelter. The complaint alleges that Mother began shaving her head because a mental illness causes her to pull her hair out, leaving bald spots. According to the complaint, Mother continued to shave her head even after the DHS terminated her parental rights on multiple occasions, including in May 2017, when she failed a hair follicle exam and failed a drug test. In addition, the complaint alleges the Department removed the children for neglect and placed them in the Department's care for more than nine months before the August 2018 final hearing. In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Mother. The SEC also announced that it would conduct a civil injunctive action against Mother, charging her with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related matter, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal proceedings against Mother and DHS. The case was handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's San Antonio Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Marquez. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Department for the Central District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter.\u00c2\u00a0In its continuing investigation, the Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov\u00c2\u00a0On\u00c2\u00a0January\u00c2\u00a017, 2018,\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA)\u00c2\u00a0and the\u00c2\u00a0Definitions of \"best interest\" include:\u00c2\u00a0Clear and convincing evidence;\u00c2\u00a0proof that a reasonable person will be able to identify and spot signs of a potential violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and\u00c2\u00a0of the Securities Act of 1933, and (3) that\u00c2\u00a0a reasonable person has demonstrated reasonable conduct in determining whether termination of parental rights is in the child's best interest."
