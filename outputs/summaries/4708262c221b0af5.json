  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas yesterday entered a final judgment against Richard A. James, Jr., a Kansas City, Kansas man who was sentenced to 180 months in prison for a 2015 attack on a federal prison official.  The court found that James violated the antifraud provisions of Section 3553(b)(3) of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, James was the only defendant in the Bureau of Prisons who had been sentenced to a full 180-month prison term.  James allegedly used a pair of beard shears James modified to have sharp ends to attack Wilson, who was walking along a row of cells when James attacked him.  As alleged in the court order, however, that James was a danger to society because of his pre-offense conduct and the nature of his criminal history.  In its judgment, the court also imposed a six-level increase to James\u2019s total offense level, which is required for a statutory maximum sentence of twenty-nine months.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, James consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay a total of $2,965, which includes a $75,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the United States District Court in Kansas granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against James and ordered him to return to the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, where he will be sentenced in a matter of weeks.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kansas Department of Criminal Justice."
