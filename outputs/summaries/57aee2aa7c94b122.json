  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Pelican Bay Forest Products, Inc., a lumber sales trader, and two of its former traders, for misappropriating trade secrets.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on June 5, 2014, Western Timber and its former president, Andrew Hotmer, agreed to settle charges that they misappropriated trade secrets from their former employer.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the alleged misappropriation, the defendants continued to use the customer information after they received the cease-and-desist letters, even after they learned that the customer list and related information was not a trade secret.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.  As alleged in the complaint, in 2013, after learning that Kelley had been attempting to sell his customer list to other traders, he told Hotmer that he had a duty of confidentiality and that he would not have hired Hotmer without knowing the customer lists and information.  Hotmer agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $37,425, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $25,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $20,000 each, and ordering Hotmer to disgorge $2,065, and $7,500, respectively, of his own ill-gotten gains plus interest, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against Hotmer.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
