  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Kevin Dameron, a former Chicago Police officer who was convicted of attempted first-degree murder and aggravated battery in May 2014.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, charges Dameron with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Dameron.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that Dameron has agreed to settle the SEC's charges against him.  According to the complaint, Dameron was arrested on May 3, 2014 and sentenced to 26 years in prison.  Dameron also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years and ordered to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  On June 9, 2014, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Dameron from future violations of Section 15(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Rule 15b2-3 thereunder. The court granted Dameron's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered him to return to his home state of Illinois, and ordered Dameron to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a $1,000 officer-director-bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint filed in the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay $10 million, and imposing a $20,000 bar against him, and ordering him not to participate in the securities industry.  He also agreed that he will not participate in any securities offering or solicitation of the purchase of a security-related security company.  A hearing on June 10, 2014 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m., and the jury deliberated for about two hours before finding Dameron guilty of the charged securities laws violations.  After the hearing, the jury found Dameron liable on all counts, including, without limitation, for the securities fraud and other related violations of the securities laws.  Judge Dorman granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations and ordered him held in contempt of court for a total of five years.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-20-2014.   The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Chicago Division of Criminal Investigations."
