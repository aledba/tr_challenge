  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment against the defendant in a workers' compensation action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, alleges that Andre Willis, who was employed by RMLS, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Willis violated the preclusion provisions of the federal securities laws, and that Willis was entitled to a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities laws.  According to the complaint, Willis filed a retaliatory discharge action in District Court on May 2, 2014 and was subsequently discharged on May 14, 2014.  In a parallel action, on September 12, 2017, the Oklahoma Court of Appeals ruled that Willis could proceed under the new federal law because the date of his injury was determined by the District Court.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Willis consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the pre-judgment provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2017."
