  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the automotive industry's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, from at least 2013 through at least 2015, Defendant and its co-conspirator, The Reynolds and Reynolds Company, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Defendant and Reynolds violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(d) of Exchange Act Rule 5d-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Defendant from violating these provisions, and orders Defendant to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount that Defendant has already paid to settle the case.  Additionally, the court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction and a temporary asset freeze, and ordered Defendant to comply with the court's order.  On May 9, 2018, the Honorable Judge St. Eve of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Mississippi entered a temporary injunction against Defendant, Reynolds, and the Reynolds and CDK Global, LLC, from violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rules 5a-5, 5c-8, and 13c-11 thereunder; ordered Reynolds to disgorge $1,078 in prejudgment interest and pay a $20,000 civil penalty; and ordered CDK to pay an $8,500 civil penalty.   The court also issued an order temporarily restraining Defendants from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws; ordering Reynolds to pay $1.5 million in disgorge interest and a $1 million civil penalty, and ordering the receiver to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit in the Chicago Regional Office, and supervised by Eric R. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner, with assistance from the Office of International Affairs and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis."
