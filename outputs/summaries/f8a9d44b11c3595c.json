  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (\"ICWA\") against the tribe and its de facto parent.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, the ICWA is a federal law that requires states to place Indian children in foster care.  The complaint alleges that the tribe, de facto parents, and de facto aunt consented to the placement of an Indian child with a non-Indian parent in violation of the federal agency's placement preferences.  As alleged in the complaint, Alexandria was placed with the tribe after her mother and father were removed from the tribe's home.  Alexandria was then placed with a de facto family in Utah, where she bonded with the family and formed a strong bond with her.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Alexandria.  On December 9, 2013, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered Alexandria to return to her tribe.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Alexandria agreed to the court's order, which permanently enjoins her from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael G. Hannan and supervised by Jennifer Lingenfelter. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Children and Family Services, and the Utah Department of Health and Human Services in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 18, 2013)."
