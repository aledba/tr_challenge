  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a Bel-Nor, Missouri man for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that, since at least 2016, Lawrence Willson has displayed three stake-mounted, freestanding signs on his front yard of his residence.  According to the complaint, the Ordinance imposes different restrictions on signs on private property, including a two-sign limit, a three-flag rule, and a \"not more than one\" sign.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Willson consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the First Amendment, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Willson.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the City of Cape Girardeau, charging Willson with violating Section 983 of the Exchange Act, and charging him with violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-2 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The court also issued a temporary restraining order, temporarily enjoining Willson from future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering him to comply with the court's order.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 983 (2014).  The complaint also seeks preliminary injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The case was supervised by Josephine Havlak, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Regulatory Affairs has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0instant search tool\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
