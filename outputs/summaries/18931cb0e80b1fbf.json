  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil action brought by the Homeowners Associations of Calumet, Indiana, alleging that they overpaid their property taxes and lacked jurisdiction to collect a full refund.  According to the court's order, filed on September 5, 2018, the defendants, Muir Woods Section One Association, Inc. and Nantucket Bay Homeowners Association Inc. (collectively, at times, \u201cthe Homeowners\u201d) obtained review and appeal of property tax assessments on common area parcels, for tax years 2006 through 2009.  The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) thereunder of the tax laws of Indiana.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of $11,290.29, prejudgment interest of $1,038.71, and a civil penalty of $12,500.00.  In a parallel action, the Indiana Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against the Defendants for their roles in the alleged overpayment of property taxes.  On September 6, 2018 the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York announced criminal charges and an emergency asset freeze.  To learn more about this matter, see Investor.gov.
