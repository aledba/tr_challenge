  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment in favor of a Michigan-based company and its subsidiary, Jude and Reed, LLC, in a case that was investigated by the Michigan Department of Commerce.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Michigan, alleges that, in 1957, Preston and Doris Sweet platted a 17-lot subdivision near Lake Michigan called the Merriweather Shores subdivision. The complaint alleges that at some point after enactment of the ZBA, they received a nonuse zoning variance that required all lots to have a minimum lot area of 20,000 square feet and a rear setback of 30 feet. According to the complaint, the application was filed in the interest of a neighbor, and the neighbor agreed to participate in the public hearing to determine whether the neighbor had standing to challenge the zoning board's decision. In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the neighbor.  In a related case, on July 15, 2008, a federal district court in Michigan issued an order requiring the settlement of a civil injunctive action brought by the neighbor against the defendant. The court granted the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  On August 24, 2018, the Honorable Kathleen M. Burns of the United States District Court in Jackson granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the settlement to be subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the State Corporation Commission, the FBI, and other emergency relief."
