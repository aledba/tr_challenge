  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of a felony in connection with his purchase of marijuana.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant, Willie James Langley, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Greenville, N.C., on 29 September 2014, the court found that a defendant had attained habitual felon status by alleging that he had committed and had been convicted of three prior felony offenses, including the lesser included offense of common law robbery.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for North Carolina announced criminal charges against Langley.  On January 26, 2015, the Court of Appeals issued an order finding that the habitual felon indictment returned against defendant was fatally defective because it did not provide conviction dates for the second and third of the three felony offenses that defendant allegedly committed, or the date the defendant was convicted of the same felony.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000.  Langley agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a permanent injunction against further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Criminal Justice's Office, and the case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the FBI's Criminal Investigations Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the U.N. Secret Service."
