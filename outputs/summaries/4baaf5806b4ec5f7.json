  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment against a California-based trucking company and its former owner in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, alleges that D & M Carriers, LLC and former owner Johnny Walters violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1404 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 14b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Walters agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California today announced criminal charges against Walters.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Walters was a Florida resident: he possessed a Florida-issued commercial driver's license and documentation concerning his work for Freymiller.  He also had an Oklahoma-issued registered driver's card.  To settle the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the court found that the forum-selection clause applied only to claims that were \"relevant\" to the interpretation and performance of the contract, not just individual claims.  For example, the complaint alleges that Mr. Walters signed an ICOELA in which he was entitled to the right to adjudicate outside of California a claim arising from a controversy arising in California, and that he was not required to participate in the judgment by the court.  On the same day, the SEC filed its Complaint against Walters, alleging that he violated the forum selection clause in his employment agreement.  It also charged Walters with violating the pre-clearance provision of Section 925 of the Exchange Act, which requires a court to determine whether a defendant is entitled to an exemption from the federal securities laws, such as the broker-dealer bar, the penny stock bar, and the bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Additionally, the Complaint alleges that Walters violated Section 10(b) of Exchange Act Rule 12b-20, and Section 17(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The case is being handled by David Duncan, Cheryl Reece, and Amy Gwiazda of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0"
