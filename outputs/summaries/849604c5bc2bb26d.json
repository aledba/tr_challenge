  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment against a Morrill County assessor who improperly used a method of valuation that was flawed when applied to the valuation of agricultural and horticultural land.  According to the SEC's order, filed on July 18, 2017, in federal district court in Morrill, Nebraska, the Trusts and Richard R. Green Living Trust (the Trusts) raised the issue of valuation based on evidence presented to the court that the assessor had failed to rebut the presumption of correctness of the Board of Equalization\u2019s valuation of their properties for tax year 2016.  The court also found that the trusts failed to show sufficient competent evidence to determine whether the valuation was reasonable, capricious, and unreasonable.  In addition, the court found that TERC improperly applied a valuation standard that was not appropriate for the purpose of evaluating the properties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the order, the trustees consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining TERC from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering TERC to pay disgorgement of $444,742, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,249, $41,824, $132,076, $91,627, and $78,966, respectively.  TERC also ordered the Trust's to pay a $75,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.   The Trusts also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to apply for a penny stock, as well as the obligation to comply with the valuation requirements of the federal securities laws. \u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the Nebraska Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued an order appointing an independent receiver to determine the value of real estate in the state of Nebraska. The SEC's investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Public Finance Abuse Unit and supervised by Eric Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Nebraska Office of Inspector General in this matter."
