  "summary": "On March 6, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska entered a final judgment against Matthew P. Iddings, Jr., a defendant who was previously convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) in Sarpy County, Nebraska. The court found that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to conduct a presentence investigation of the defendant prior to sentencing.  The court also found that, contrary to the court\u2019s recommendation, the defendant had not been in jail since 2017 and planned to remain so.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced that it would not impose an additional 18 months of incarceration on the defendant.  According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in federal district court for the southern district of New Jersey, the court improperly imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of 18 months to 5 years, with a $10,000 fine, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the judge consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  On March 8, 2019 the court granted the defendant a temporary restraining order and ordered him to be enjoined from further violations of the federal\u00c2\u00a0institutions\u00c2\u00a0book\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0the securities laws, including Section\u00c2\u00a014(a)(1) and (3) and\u00c2\u00a0\u00a714(b)(2)(A) thereunder, ordering a conduct-based conduct investigation, imposing a pre-judgmental injunction, and ordering a hearing on the matter.   The final judgment also orders the defendant to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 penalty.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  Separately, the Court of Appeals issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the supervision of the receiver, ordering the receiver to provide a copy of the sentencing order to the receiver and to provide the receiver with an accounting of the amount of time spent in the receiver's custody.  Finally, on March 9, 2019 a federal judge granted the receiver an emergency court order requiring him to comply with a court order that imposed an 18-month prison sentence.  A hearing on March 10, 2019 was scheduled for 11:30 a.m."
