  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a Texas-based mother and father who were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that, from at least February 2016 through September 2018, the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services terminated the parental rights of a five-year-old Carter and his mother.  According to the complaint, Carter was removed from his mother's care when he was five years old and was placed in a residential treatment facility for substance abuse and neglectful supervision. The complaint alleges that Carter's mother was a stay-at-home mom and father was a convicted felon with a history of drug and alcohol use.  Carter told his mother that he had seen his father smoke something that was black, and that his father \"whooped\" him on the eye when he fell down the stairs.  As alleged, the complaint further alleges that when Carter was confronted by a caseworker at the time about the alleged drug use, his mother refused to take him into her home.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Carter.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Houston Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
