  "summary": "On May 7, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Black Fork Wind Energy, L.L.C., granting a two-year extension of its certificate to construct a wind farm in Crawford and Richland Counties.  According to the court's order, on March 24, 2016, Black Fork filed an application to extend its certificate by two years, citing the lack of a staff investigation and report.  Black Fork's motion, filed in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, alleged that the board improperly granted the application because it did not follow the statutory process for amending a certificate.  The court also issued an order granting Black Fork a temporary restraining order preventing it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the order, the board has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Black Fork from violating these provisions and orders, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of any monetary penalty imposed by the court.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action, which seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and an officer and director bar.  On May 8, the court granted the board's motion for leave to respond to a request for a hearing on the merits of the matter.  A hearing has been scheduled for May 9, 2017.
