  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the town of Windsor, Connecticut, against Newman Architects, LLC, Herbert S. Newman, and Michael Raso.  According to the court's order, filed on February 2, 2016, the defendants previously performed work for the town under two separate contracts for services relating to the school. The court found that the defendants had failed to adequately demonstrate that the school was structurally sound, so that the project could be renovated to standards comparable to a new building.  The court also found that Newman and Raso had not performed any work on the project after the town held a referendum on the $35 million appropriation and bond authorization for renovations at the school, which the town's residents voted to approve.  In its judgment, the court found for the defendants that there was no reasonable basis for concluding that the action was commenced within seven years of the alleged negligence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Newman, Raso, and Newman consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 10-cv-5221 (January 12, 2016).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the SEC's Investor.gov website.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Education and the Connecticut Office of Inspections and Examinations, including the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, in this matter."
