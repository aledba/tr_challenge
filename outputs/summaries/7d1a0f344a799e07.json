  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against a Kansas City, Kansas woman who was convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Wichita, Kansas, alleges that Lisa A. Smith violated the First Amendment by making a statement in public that raised the risk of harm to the reputation of her husband.  According to the complaint, Smith made the statement while standing in the front yard of his home, which was across the street from her husband's home.  As alleged, Smith's statement raised no reasonable threat to his or her reputation in the community by making the statement.  Smith also allegedly recorded the statement through a video and audio surveillance system installed outside her home. The complaint also alleges that Smith violated Section 21 of the Exchange Act because she was not registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Smith consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Smith.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the Federal District Court in Kansas issued a temporary restraining order against Smith and ordered her to comply with the court's order. The order also prohibits Smith from making direct or indirect disparaging statements in public regarding a person who has committed a serious or imminent threat of physical harm, and from disseminating or disseminating such material on social media. The court also issued a preliminary injunction against Smith from further violations of the federal anti-stalking laws, ordering him to pay $1,000 in restitution, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.  A hearing on May 26, 2019 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kansas Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5771 (2014).  The Commission on Civil and Administrative Rights has issued an Order suspending Smith from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The Commission has also issued an order requiring Smith to provide a written and oral history of his alleged history of abuse of the right to free and simple speech."
