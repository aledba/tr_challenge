  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against the United States Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management in an emergency action to halt oil and gas leases in the Santa Fe National Forest.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that the Forest Service violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that BLM failed to adequately evaluate the impact of the leases on the environment.  In addition, the complaint alleges that BLM did not adequately consider the potential impacts of oil-and-gas leases on air quality.  According to the complaint, as a result of BLM's failure to consider the impact on the air quality, the agency could not issue any leases at all.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an expedited hearing to determine whether to proceed with the litigation.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Gershfeld of the U.N. Court in New York granted the Defendants' request for a preliminary injunction, ordered BLM to comply with the court's order, and ordered the BLM to provide a copy of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) to the agency's staff as well as to provide an accounting of the cumulative impacts of each lease. The court also granted the parties' motion for an emergency court order halting the issuance of the FEIS and ordering BLM to conduct a \"hard look\" at the impacts of any lease sale on the Earth's atmosphere. The Court granted the request for an asset freezing order, ordered the asset freeze and other emergency relief, and issued an order requiring BLM to submit a final environmental impact statement by the end of the year. The order also requires BLM to maintain a record of its compliance with the relevant federal rules, including the date of issuance of an EIS and the date that the leases are to be leased.
