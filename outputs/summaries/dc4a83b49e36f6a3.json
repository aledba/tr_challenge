  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida today announced criminal charges against a Florida father and two other men in connection with an international child abduction case.  According to the SEC's complaint, on May 15, 2009, American Christy Bailey and her two nine-month-old sons, Roque Jacinto Fernandez and Montoya Alvarez, fled Panama in the face of a court order that ordered the return of the children to Panama.  The complaint alleges that Bailey and Fernandez violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Bailey and Alvarez are dual Panamanian citizens, and the complaint further alleges that the father and the other two men were unlawfully removed from Panama in 2014.  As alleged in the complaint, Bailey and Rodriguez were not settled in their new country of habitual residence when they were abducted, and Rodriguez was unable to obtain a visa to attend the 2010 Hague Convention hearing because of the mother\u2019s repeated abduction of the boys.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the mother consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and orders Rodriguez to return the boys to their new home.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Child and Family Education today issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of International Affairs and the Division of Justice in the Department of Justice's Cyber Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Elizabeth A. Rossi and Brett Stark, and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (CISIS) in this matter."
