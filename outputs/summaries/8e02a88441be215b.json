  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against Integrated, Inc. (\"Integrated\"), a California-based insurance company, and its former vice president of human resources for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, alleges that Integrated violated the federal securities laws by failing to provide sufficient evidence to establish that all of the defendants agreed to arbitration.  The complaint further alleges Integrated failed to provide any corroborating evidence to support its claims that the defendants had signed an arbitration agreement.  According to the complaint, Integrated also failed to show that Cade signed a copy of the arbitration agreement when she received it from the prior owner of the hospitals.  In addition, the complaint alleges Cade did not sign an acknowledgment form or an employee handbook containing the arbitration provision.    The court's order against Integrated and the other defendants is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Los Angeles Regional Office and the case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the California Office of Regulatory Affairs (OIEA) in this matter.
