  "summary": "On March 19, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina entered a final judgment against Chase Bank, N.C.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Chase violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Chase, through its predecessor, Washington Mutual, sought to secure a loan from Washington Mutual in the Southern District of Florida.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that the Robeys purchased a residential lot at 127 Welding Way, Beach Mountain, Fla., on June 10, 2005, and then sought to acquire the property through a loan modification.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Carolina today announced criminal charges against Chase.  On March 24, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Chase, charging him with violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Chase consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 13(a)(1) and 13(b)(3) and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  Chase has also agreed to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.  For example, in a recent case, a federal district court in Miami, Florida entered a temporary restraining order against Chase and ordered him to return the property to its owner, barring him from participating in any future offering of the property.  Additionally, the court granted Chase's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 and Rule 15a2-2 thereunder, and ordered Chase to pay civil penalties of $1 million and $500,000, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Further, Chase has agreed to settle the case against him by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Exchange Act Section 13(e) and Rule 12b-"
