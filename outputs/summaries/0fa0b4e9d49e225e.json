  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Maria Leslie for breach of fiduciary duty by not disclosing the true value of a community asset divided in the marital settlement agreement (MSA).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, Leslie, a California resident, and her husband, Byron Georgiou, entered into an MSA in 2002 that entitled them to a referral fee of 10 percent of the ultimate recovery of approximately $7.2 billion, pursuant to the terms of its fee agreement with the Regents of the University of California, Los Angeles.  The complaint alleges that Georgisou misled Leslie into believing his potential referral fee would be between $9 and $33 million, and that he had secured the plaintiff and secured the settlement.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the MSA did not authorize a postjudgment action, and Leslie was not entitled to the referral fee.  In addition, the court found that Leslie could not take the benefits of the judgment and, instead, obtained 50 percent or 100% of the fee, which was not sufficient to satisfy the court's requirements.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Leslie consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On December 13, 2010 the court granted Leslie's motion for summary adjudication, which is subject to court approval, and ordered her to file a civil injunctive action under section 1101 of the Family Code. The court also granted Leslie a temporary restraining order, which prohibits her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to a penny stock, and a broker-dealer registration. The SEC's order also prohibits Leslie from associating with any third party in connection with a judgment, including a lawyer, broker, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal bankruptcy court, or municipal securities court. The order also requires Leslie to provide a copy of the settlement agreement with which she agreed to settle the matter.  Finally, the order requires her to provide an accounting of her assets and liabilities in the event of an emergency, such as an emergency.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 1, 2007).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
