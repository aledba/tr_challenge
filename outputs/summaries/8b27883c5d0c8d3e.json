  "summary": "On February 22, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment in favor of a motion for preliminary injunction against the defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that the defendants failed to adequately assess the children's language proficiency and allow them to access the benefits of the Defendants' ELL Plan.  According to the complaint, the defendants were denied access to a traditional, integrated classroom because of their illness.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants delayed enrolling the children in their public high schools because they were \"getting older\" and could not afford to pay for their education.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the Defendants have an unlawful policy and practice of excluding foreign-born children from public school.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and the Commission's findings, Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.

A hearing on the matter is scheduled for May 24, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 583 (January 21, 2019).  The complaint also seeks preliminary injunction, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Separately, the Commission has issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an order suspending or issuing a temporary restraining order against the Defendants from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering the receiver to provide an accounting of the alleged harm caused to the children by the suspension of school-aged, immigrant children from participating in public school, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against the receiver. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's order also prohibits the issuance of any emergency relief, including an injunction against"
