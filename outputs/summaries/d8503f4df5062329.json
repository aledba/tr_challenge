  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Wells Fargo Bank, N.Y., a New Jersey-based bank, and its principal, Yolanda P. Plasencia, a/k/a Donasia Pena, in connection with a mortgage foreclosure action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Jersey on June 8, 2015, Wells Fargo, as the borrower, executed and delivered to Wachovia Bank a promissory note in the principal amount of $300,000.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the foreclosure action, the borrower was obligated to pay a late charge of five percent of any payment due under the note, and to pay an additional $100,000 in late fees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount owed under the notes.  In addition, the court granted Wells Fargo's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and granted the company's motion for a preliminary injunction.  Wells Fargo has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordering that it pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and that it will pay a $500,000 civil penalty.  On August 18, 2011, the New Jersey court granted the bank's request to halt foreclosure proceedings against the borrower in a separate action in which it obtained a court order to foreclose on the mortgage on the borrower's real estate.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and Glenn S. Gordon of the New York Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Jersey Department of Banking and Securities and Investments."
