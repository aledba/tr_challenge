  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama yesterday entered a final judgment against a former contractor and two others for defrauding the government in connection with an implied certification theory.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Huntsville, Alabama, alleges that, from at least 2010 to 2012, MD Helicopters and two other companies violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder.  According to the complaint, MD and its former director of sales and marketing, Norbert Vergez, misled the government about MD's pre-contract representations to the government and MD's submission of claims for reimbursement to the agency. The complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to disclose that MD and Vergez had engaged in a fraudulent inducement scheme, in which MD provided false or incomplete information about the specific services provided by specific types of professionals, and that the government relied on the information in awarding the contract.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  To learn more about alleged fraud in the alleged inducement theory, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 21, 2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Department of Insurance, and the Alabama Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
