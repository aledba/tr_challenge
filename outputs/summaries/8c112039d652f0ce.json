  "summary": "On May 13, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against First National Bank of Oneida, N.A., a Tennessee-based real-estate developer, for its failure to timely discharge a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case.  The court also granted First National a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze to prevent it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  First National's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, in July 2009, Donald Brandt filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition without a discharge, claiming that First National was not required to file a deficiency judgment related to pre-petition real estate loans because it had not filed an amended proof of claim in Brandt\u2019s bankruptcy case, as required by the Chapter 11 plan.  In addition, First National alleges that in August 2010, after Brandt moved the bankruptcy court to dismiss his Chapter 11 case, he received an automatic discharge from First National without a hearing.  According to the complaint, Brandt then filed a second amended complaint in January 2016, this time seeking to collect the remaining amounts due on several loans after the real estate securing those loans was sold and the proceeds of those sales did not cover the outstanding balances.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the complaint charges First National with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The complaint also charges Brandt with violating Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and with violating Rule 15a-3 thereunder of the Exchange Act and Rules 15b-20, 13a-1, and 16a-11 thereunder; and with aiding and abetting First National and First National Defendants' violations of Section 5(b).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Brandt.
