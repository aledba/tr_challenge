  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon today announced criminal charges against a community corrections specialist who was terminated for his alleged inability to perform the job.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that, for the first time in the history of the agency, a former supervisor at a correctional center was terminated because of his disability.  According to the complaint, the supervisor told plaintiff that he was unable to perform essential functions of the position, particularly running in response to emergencies. The complaint further alleges that the supervisor failed to mention that he had been the only existing specialist performing the job at the time of his termination, and that, until the van incident, he had never run to an emergency.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he did not participate in any type of emergency response, including running or navigating stairs, when he was required to do so by the supervisor.  As a result of the supervisor\u2019s actions, the SEC filed a complaint against the supervisor, alleging that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and orders the supervisor to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investment in a business using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
