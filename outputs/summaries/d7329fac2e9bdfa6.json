  "summary": "On August 20, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana entered a final judgment against Walter C. Dumas and Associates, Inc., a Louisiana-based law firm, finding they violated the Louisiana Code of Governmental Ethics and ordering them to pay $138,000.00 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, alleges that Dumas violated the antifraud provisions of Section 42:1115A of the Ethics Code.  Dumas, a member of the Board of Supervisors, and his law firm agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  According to the complaint, Dumas also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public university and to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his salary.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Dumas.  On August 21, 2009, the SEC filed an emergency action charging Dumas with violations of the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws, and Dumas agreed to pay the civil penalty.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants violated the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the reporting provision of Section 5(b)(5) and (c) thereunder of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Rules of Conduct, and to be enjoined from future violations of these provisions.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions, orders Dumas to disgorge $13,800.00, plus a $96,600.00 penalty, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of up to $140,000 each.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by C.T. Traina, Inc. of the New Orleans Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Louisiana Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
