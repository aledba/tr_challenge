  "summary": "On December 11, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri entered a final judgment against Douglas Savage, Jr., a former employee of Waste Management, Inc., a Missouri-based waste management company, for his role in a 2015 motor vehicle accident.  The court granted the SEC's motion for summary judgment against Savage, who agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 304.016.4(2) of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $25,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, on January 3, 2019, a federal district court in Kansas City, Missouri, entered a judgment against Appellant, finding that he had a duty to protect the plaintiff from injury, that he failed to keep a careful lookout, and that he was negligent in failing to properly signal his intent to turn left.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s order, Savage consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions, and ordering him to disgorge $2,078 in prejudgment interests, pay $1,038 in civil penalties, and pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  On January 4, 2019 the U-S District Court in Kansas again entered a preliminary injunction against Savage and ordered him to comply with the court order. The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Savage.  According to the SEC, the court found that Savage violated Section 304 and Rule 304 thereunder, and issued a temporary injunctive relief order against him. The SEC's order also ordered Savage to pay a civil monetary penalty of $10 million, and to pay an $8,500 civil penalty, for a total of $20,000.  As a result of the settlement, Savage has agreed to a permanent injunction, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature\u00c2\u00a0on Investor.gov to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
