  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of stealing a stolen vehicle.  The court's order, which entered a temporary restraining order against Robert Kenneth Wehr, permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $950.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Wehr was convicted in 2017 of theft of a motor vehicle worth $950 or less and sentenced to nine years in prison. The court found true a prior conviction for theft and making the theft a felony, but did not consider the value of the stolen vehicle a felony.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Wehr. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
