  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Shayne William Reed, Jr., a former resident of Marienville, Pennsylvania, who was convicted of two felony counts of burglary, criminal trespass, conspiracy of theft by unlawful taking, and conspiracy of receiving stolen property.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bradford, charges Reed with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Appellant violated Section 3502(a)(4) and (a)(3) and that he entered the shed through an open door and entered through an unsecured padlock on the shed.  According to the complaint, when confronted by a neighbor, he replied, \"No, you do not have permission to be in that area.\"  The complaint also alleges that when confronted with a neighbor who questioned his response, he left the shed and returned a short time later, leaving the property with a broken door handle and an unfamiliar padlock.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Reed consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and a $25,000 officer-and-director bar.  On May 23, 2018, a jury convicted Appellants of violating the federal antifasc laws and sentenced him to twelve months' imprisonment followed by twelve months of supervised release.  Appelant also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to a five-year conduct-based injunction, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service, including the right to reapply after five years of imprisonment.  Reed agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws and ordering him to disgorge $5,000 in prejudgment interests, pay $1,500 in civil penalties, and pay $2,038 in officer and director bar, plus a $100,000 bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019).  The case is being handled by John R. Rymas of the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and"
