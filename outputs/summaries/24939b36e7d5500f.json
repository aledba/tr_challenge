  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant in a civil action brought by the California Department of Insurance against Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chico, California on August 1, 2008, a jury found that a defendant was entitled to a net monetary recovery when he or she obtained a judgment that required him or her to pay a civil penalty of $23,500.  The court also found that the defendants were not entitled to mandatory costs when, in fact, they were.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants had agreed to settle the litigation without admitting or denying any of the defendants' claims.  In addition, the court found that, in the event of a default judgment, the defendant could not recover any money from the settlement.    In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1032(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties equal to the amount of their disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary recovery of $12,731.92, which represents the amount owed to the defendant in the settlement and the amount that the defendant has agreed to pay in the future.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted an administrative proceeding against the defendant, which resulted in a temporary restraining order, an injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  On August 2, 2009, a federal district court in San Diego entered a judgment ordering the relief ordered by the court to be contingent upon the outcome of a court-ordered administrative proceeding. The court granted the relief sought by the relief defendant, Community Hospital, Inc. (now known as KMR Property Management), to be subject to court approval of the relief order. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the San Diego Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Office of Compliance and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
