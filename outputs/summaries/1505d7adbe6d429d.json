  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Kentucky announced today that it has obtained an emergency court order to hold a juvenile delinquent in contempt of court.  The SEC's complaint alleges that C.S., a Kentucky resident, ran away from her foster home on October 27, 2015 and was found on November 5, 2015, in violation of a court order requiring her to be held in contempt.  According to the complaint, the court issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order suspending her from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an adult for a period of six months.  In a parallel action, the Kentucky Attorney General's Office today announced that it had obtained a temporary court order temporarily suspending her pending a hearing on the matter.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, however, this order was never entered as part of a valid court order and was effectively terminated without the entry of a written order regulating her future conduct.  On January 6, 2017, the Breathitt Family Court granted the court order suspending the detention order and ordered the release of the juvenile delinquent, who was previously charged with contempt as a public criminal offense.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint or the SEC complaint, both defendants consented to the issuance of the order suspending them from appearing, practicing, or appearing before the court as adults. The court also ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Additionally, the Court issued a contempt order against C. S. for her failure to comply with the court's order.  A hearing scheduled for January 18, 2017 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. EST. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Release Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage parents to check the backgrounds of their children by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0OnInvestigations.gov.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action on February 1, 2017.   The court granted the SEC's request for an expedited hearing on March 15, 2017 to determine whether to issue a civil contempt order or hold a hearing for a hearing in which the court will determine the appropriate amount of time to hold the defendant in contempt and determine the severity of the penalty.  This hearing was conducted by Billie Maggard, a Kentucky-based social worker, and was supervised by Amy C. McKinley of the SEC Enforcement Division's Criminal Investigations Division. "
