  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alaska today entered a final judgment against defendant Teddy Smith, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, Smith, who was brought to trial in Kotzebue, Alaska on charges of attempted murder, first-degree robbery, and third-degree assault, falsely claimed that all residents of the village of Kiana were members of a separate, cognizable cultural group that comprised two distinct ethnic groups.  The complaint further alleged that Smith failed to show that the village residents constituted a distinct ethnic group when, in fact, they constituted a separate ethnic group.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Smith did not provide the court with sufficient evidence to support his assertion that the residents of these villages constituted two distinct cultural groups, and that he had failed to meet his burden of proof by failing to adequately represent the interests of the people living within a 5-mile radius of the venue district where the alleged crime allegedly occurred.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Smith consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Smith also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about jury selection in Alaska, see Alaska Jury Selection Rule 15(c).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alaska Department of Justice, and the Alaska State Corporation Commission in this matter."
