  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Missouri announced today that it has obtained a final judgment against a former employee of a Missouri-based company who was terminated for misconduct related to her work.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, alleges that Katherine Valley, a cost accountant, was terminated in March 2018 for engaging in a conduct that constituted bullying as well as harassment on the basis of a protected classification, i.e., that an authority figure was similarly situated to those protected under classifications such as race, color, national origin, divorce, veteran status, and sexual orientation.  According to the complaint, Ms. Valley asked the company's human resources director whether she could talk to a director about the circumstances of the terminated employee\u2019s termination, and she was told that she could not because she was not treating co-workers with respect and creating conflict in the workplace.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the company consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  In a parallel action, the Department of Health and Human Services today announced that it had obtained a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against the company and its former chief of staff in connection with the alleged misconduct.  On August 28, 2018, the department issued a corrective action form that included a warning about potential violations of the employer's policy of not paying vacation pay when an employee is terminated, and an order requiring the company to provide a copy of the disciplinary order for the employee to be filed with the court.   The complaint also alleges that Ms. Voorhees, a former senior manager at the company, asked the HR director about a pending disciplinary action by the company in January 2018, and that the employee replied, \"No, that's not really a good use of my time.\"  In addition, the complaint alleges that the company failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its findings, and the company was not required to comply with the Commission's order.  As a result, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Additionally, the Commission is seeking an officer-and-director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Scott J. Scott and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Ms. Walker and Ms. Downey."
