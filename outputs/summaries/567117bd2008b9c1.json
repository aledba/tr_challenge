  "summary": "The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida today entered final judgments in favor of defendants Robert L. Edwards and Wolf Arbin Weinhold in connection with the filing of an emergency action to restructure the Henderson County, North Carolina real estate estate estate.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Tampa, Florida, alleges that the trustee, CPP, and Smith violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(1) thereunder, and that the court improperly granted the trustee and Weinhold the right to proceed with an action for compensation for the property damage.  According to the complaint, the trustee also failed to adequately represent the interests of the real party in interest in the property when the 2013 assignment was executed.  In addition, the complaint alleges that WLAE was not a party to the 2012 assignment when it was executed and that it had no right to revoke the sale of the 80 percent general partnership interest in Wolf\u2019s Lair to the acquiring entity at any time prior to March 7, 2014.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, require them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $400,000, and requires the trustee to pay a $100,000 civil penalty in the amount of $500,000.  Additionally, the court agreed to the payment of a $50,000 penalty to the trustee in the alternative, which is subject to court approval of the final judgments, and to the appointment of a receiver to manage the property.   The court also agreed to a final judgment ordering the receiver to consent to the issuance of a cease-and-desist order, ordering a temporary restraining order, and appointing a receiver for the real parties in interest.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against defendant Weinhold.
