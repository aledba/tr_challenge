  "summary": "On June 26, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico entered a final judgment against William Serna, a convicted felon in possession of a firearm in connection with another felony drug possession offense.  The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, as well as other emergency relief.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, N.M. on May 29, 2019 (D.N.M., Jan. 12, 2019) that granted the Court's motion for a preliminary injunction, entered a default judgment, and entered an order suspending the asset freeze pending final judgment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico today announced criminal charges against the defendant for his role in a drug-trafficking scheme.   The SEC's complaint alleges that, in a hand-to-hand transaction that resembled a narcotics transaction, the defendant was likely emboldened to possess his methamphetamine and could protect himself and his drug supply.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court also issued an order freezing the assets of the defendant and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Denver Regional Office and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Mexico Department of Justice, the Albuquerque Police Department, and the FBI in this matter.
