  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against the city of Santa Maria for defrauding the city's bond holders.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Santa Maria, California, alleges that the city as successor was entitled to money from the fund to make bond payments on revenue bonds.  According to the complaint, the city was not entitled to the funds to make the bond payments because the bonds at issue were not pledged to make payments on the bonds and instead were pledged for the repayment of the bonds. The complaint further alleges that, as a result of the alleged misappropriation of the funds, Santa Maria's bond debt service obligations were insufficient to cover bond payments. The SEC alleges that Santa Maria failed to recognize the bond debt as an enforceable obligation and to use the funds for bond payments under subdivision (a)(2)(B) of section 34183.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the City and the Department of Finance have agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Santa Maria from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Santa Maria to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $2,681,325. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the California Secretary of State's Office today announced that it filed a writ of mandamus with the SEC, which seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Santa Maria and its successor agency.  Santa Maria has also agreed to a temporary restraining order, which prohibits it from issuing or selling any bonds, and to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $1.5 million and $2.6 million, respectively. The court also ordered the city to comply with the requirements of the federal securities laws, including the issuance of bonds and the payment of civil penalties. Santa Maria agreed to settle the case by consenting to a court-ordered injunction, which requires it to provide for an independent examination of the issues raised in the complaint. The final judgment also requires the city and the department to submit to the SEC a copy of the final judgment, which will be reviewed and approved by the court upon motion of the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the California Office of Financial Regulation."
