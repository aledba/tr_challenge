  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Social Security Administration's (SSA) denial of Brightmon Brightmon\u2019s application for disability benefits.  The SEC alleges that Brightmon was not disabled because he had a high-school education and the residual functional capacity to perform a full range of work at the medium exertional level. Brightmon has been diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the cervical spine, lumbar spine, right wrist, and both hips, as well as with severe degenerative joint disease and bilateral facet arthropathy in his knees. The complaint alleges that, despite having a high school education, Brightmon had limited range of motion in his neck, back, hips, and knees, and that he had experienced complications from recent esophageal surgery. The SEC further alleges that he denied back pain or muscle aches to Dr. John Desrochers, a state-agency medical consultant who reviewed Brightmon's medical records and offered an opinion about whether Brightmon could perform medium work despite his physical impairments. According to the SEC's complaint, the SSA's final judgment, which permanently enjoins Brightmon from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, orders Brightmon to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Health and Human Services today announced criminal charges against Brightmon.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal court in New York, charging Brightmon with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-1 thereunder. The court also ordered Brightmon and his family to pay civil penalties of $15,000 each.  Brightmon consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The Court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, which is pending final approval by the court. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of the Secretary of State in this matter."
