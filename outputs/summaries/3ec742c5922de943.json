  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against Moorefield Construction, Inc., a licensed general contractor for the construction of a Best Buy store in Visalia, California.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Moorefield violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to adequately disclose material weaknesses in the building's foundation.  According to the complaint, Moorefield failed to disclose that the foundation of the Best Buy building was defective and that he had installed the flooring on top of the concrete slab.  Moorefield also failed to show that there was any potential for the building to fail.  In addition, the complaint alleges Moorefield did not adequately disclose to the court that he was responsible for the failure of the foundation and that, in fact, he was liable for the foundation's failure because the foundation had been improperly installed.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Moorefield to pay $377,404 in attorney fees and $160,000 in prejudgment interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the New York District Court issued a temporary restraining order and ordered Moorefield and Sansone to pay a civil penalty of $1.31 million, which is equal to the amount of their disgorgement plus interest, and to pay civil penalties of $325,000 and $375,000, respectively.  Last year, the SEC issued an order requiring the insurers to provide a copy of the final judgment to each of them.  This order also requires the insurance companies to provide an accounting of any potential liability arising from a non-covered claim.   In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Moorefields. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check whether they are registered professionals by using the investor.gov website to quickly identify whether their investments are subject to SEC approval."
