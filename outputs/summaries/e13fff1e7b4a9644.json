  "summary": "On January 17, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a final judgment against Madison Stock Transfer, Inc. (\"Madison Stock\"), a New York-based registered representative company, and its former president, Mark Julian, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Julian and his companies, Scorpion Bay Holdings, Inc., Soleeze Wave, LLC, and Zenlux, Ltd., falsely claimed that Madison Stock had jurisdiction over them when, in fact, the defendants had no jurisdiction at all.  The SEC alleges that, contrary to Madison Stock's claims, Madison Stock has no jurisdiction over Julian, and has failed to show that it has any reasonable basis for acting as a broker in connection with the issuances of the shares.  In a parallel action, on Jan. 17, 2020, the SEC charged Madison Stock with violating the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 13(a)(1) and 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 12b2-1, and 13a-13 thereunder, and charged Julian with violating Exchange Act Rule 12b20.  Madison Stock agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders Madison Stock to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,931.36.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Madison stock has agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Section 13(e)(2) and Rule 13b-14, and ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Mr. Dolan of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger of the Boston Regional Office and was supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The trial is being conducted by Graham Loomis of the New York Regional Office, and the litigation is being led by Ms. Gibson."
