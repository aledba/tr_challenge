  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment against the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) on whether to delist the gray wolf from the agency's list of threatened and endangered species.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that Oregon Gov. Kate Brown signed Oregon Laws 2016, chapter 36, without consulting the agency or the state attorney general, that the legislature violated the federal securities laws by delisting a gray wolf.  According to the complaint, Brown and the Oregon Attorney General's Office issued an order requiring the state Attorney General to file an emergency action to expedite the delisting process.  In a parallel action, the Oregon Secretary of State's Office today announced criminal charges against Brown.  Brown has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a final order that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in Brown's Complaint, Brown has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any federal securities law, including the right to reapply as an officer or director of a public agency. Brown has also agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  On March 2, 2016, the Honorable Judge William G. Hannan of the Umpqua Regional Office granted Brown's request for a temporary restraining order, an order appointing a receiver, and an officer-and-director bar against Brown and Hannan. The court granted the Commission's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered Brown to comply with the court's order, and appointed a receiver. The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Scott A. Thompson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Office of the Inspector General of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Washington."
