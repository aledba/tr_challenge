  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan today entered final judgments against defendants who were found liable for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Michigan, alleges that defendant Christopher W. Rucker, who was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison for a first-degree murder conviction, violated the pre-judgmental provisions of Section 769.25a of the Michigan Department of Corrections.  According to the complaint, Rucker consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 30 years and 60 years, respectively.  Rucker also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the mandatory sentencing provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants agreed to permanent injunctions against future violations, and agreed to pay civil penalties of up to 30 years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Rucker.  On December 21, 2017, the U. S.

Louisiana, 577 US. at 489, 585 N.D. 2d 502 (2014).  The court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the amount of money spent on the relief sought by the court, and ordered Rucker to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty equal to the amount that he has already paid in restitution to the victims of his prior felony conviction.  Finally, the court issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to resentence Rucker on the basis of evidence found in his prior criminal conviction. The receiver will determine the appropriate amount of restitution to be paid by the receiver.  A hearing for the receiver will be conducted by the district attorney, and the case will be supervised by the Chief of the Department of Justice.
