  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi yesterday entered a final judgment against Jackson State University and its Athletic Director, Dr. Vivian Fuller, alleging Dr. Fuller violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, shortly after learning of the alleged misconduct by Robinson, the Athletic Director of Jackson State agreed to be terminated without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint. The SEC also alleges that Robinson, a certified trainer and then-longtime Director of Sports Medicine at Jackson State, was the only person to corroborate the findings of the Commission's complaint.  According to the complaint, Robinson and two other Jackson State employees, Dalandus Henderson, a budget accountant for the athletic department, observed and corroborated Robinson\u2019s account of the termination. The complaint further alleges that after the termination, Robinson met with two Jackson State attorneys, David Buford and Latoya Merritt, who both agreed to represent Robinson in the SEC case. Robinson and Henderson agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws. Robinson also agreed to pay $7,100 in disgorgement, $25,000 in prejudgment interest, and a $75,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Robinson, charging him with violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of The Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder under Section 13 of the Exchange Act. Robinson agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $32,100, which is equal to the amount of his attorney's fees, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. In a parallel action, the Commission issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent review of its complaint against Robinson. The Commission's investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by C.J."
