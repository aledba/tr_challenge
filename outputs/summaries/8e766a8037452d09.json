  "summary": "On June 22, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho entered a final judgment against the Idaho Industrial Commission in a worker's compensation case.  The SEC's complaint alleges that the Commission violated the antifraud provisions of Section 72-717 of the workers' compensation laws.  According to the complaint, on November 3, 2017, the Commission issued an order finding that a company truck driver who was injured while driving a farm equipment truck in 2009 had a low-back condition that prevented him from being able to participate in a fair hearing. The complaint further alleges that Ayala's claim had been pending for five years when the referee took the matter under advisement. The Commission's order found that the driver was not totally and permanently disabled under the odd-lot worker doctrine, and that he suffered disability of 40% of the whole person inclusive of impairment of his 2009 and 2013 industrial accidents.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Ayala consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his compensation.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Ayala.  On June 24, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the Commission, charging Ayala with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and an order requiring the Commission to conduct a fair and impartial review of worker compensation claims. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and the appointment of a hearing officer and an examiner. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Idaho Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Idaho Department of Insurance, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of State's Office, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the Idaho Office of Insurance Regulation (OIE) in this matter."
