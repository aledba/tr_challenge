  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Matthew Stuard, Jr., a California resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 3104 of the federal and state laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Sacramento, Matthew and his wife, Rebekah, raised the issue of grandparent visitation with their daughter, Riley, in an effort to preserve the bond between Riley and her paternal grandparents.  The complaint alleges that Matthew raised the issues of parental unfitness and the need to maintain a strong bond between the grandparents and the child.  As alleged in the complaint, Matthew was not entitled to the visitation rights because he was not a fit parent.  In addition, the complaint alleges Matthew failed to adequately consider the relationship between Riley's grandparents, Jeff and Cindy, and their role in allowing the child to develop a relationship with her.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, Matthew consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay $3,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $2,500 civil penalty.  Matthew also agreed to participate in anger management counseling at his own expense, which he has agreed to do.  Finally, the court granted Matthew's motion for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from associating with any third party, barring him from participating in any type of adult-child visitation, and ordering him to comply with a court order requiring him to provide a copy of the final judgment to each of the parties in the case.  Additionally, Matthew agreed to be enjoined from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Education, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Office of Children and Family Education."
