  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a former narcotics detective who was convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that Jerome Hill, a narcotics detective with the South Houston Police Department, conducted an unregistered search of a South Houston home on June 16, 2016. According to the complaint, Hill asked for a warrant to search the home, which Hill did not have. The complaint alleges that Hill replied, \"Hey, we have a search warrant. We're going to find the drugs. Just tell me where they are.\"  The complaint further alleges that, by her own admission, Forster was not in custody for Miranda purposes because he had broken up with her boyfriend, Jimmy McCullough, and had decided to move out of his house.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Hill arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On August 2, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Hill and ordered him to be enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Hill from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged conduct of Hill and McCole. The court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC."
