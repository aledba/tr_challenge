  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against CGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc., a Kentucky-based private company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Franklin County, Kentucky, alleges that, in 2011 and 2012, Kentucky Health Cooperative, Inc. (KYHC) sought approval from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to offer health plans to Kentucky citizens.  According to the complaint, however, the Commission found that the Commission lacked jurisdiction over the Commission's arbitration provision.  In addition, the complaint alleges that CGI failed to comply with the arbitration provision, and the Commission has not issued an order requiring it to do so.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, CGI has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of its civil penalties.  Additionally, the Court has not ruled on whether CGI's motion to withdraw its complaint against the Commission, or whether it has agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-42-HRW, July 13, 2018.  On August 14, 2017, the SEC filed an emergency action against CGI, alleging that it had violated the federal securities laws and that it was liable to pay civil penalties in the event of a default judgment by the Commission.
