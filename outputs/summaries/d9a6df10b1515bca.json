  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that a defendant was arrested and subsequently charged in a felony criminal case with knowingly bringing controlled substances into a state prison. The complaint further alleges that the defendant was subject to a Fourth Amendment waiver that imposed reasonable bail conditions even when she was released on bail.  According to the complaint, Webb, who had been convicted in a previous felony case, was released after posting bail on a condition that she waive her Fourth Amendment right to be free of warrantless or unreasonable searches.  In its judgment, the court found that, as a reasonable condition of release, Webb was entitled to a fair hearing and a fair trial.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Webb consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a $50,000 civil penalty, and imposes a $25,000 bar on her from practicing medicine. The court also ordered Webb to surrender voluntarily pursuant to a warrant setting bail, which she did not do, and ordered her release on a \"reasonable condition.\"  The court's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, orders Webb to comply with the court's order, pay a civil penalty of $25 million, and appoint a receiver to determine the amount of bail to be imposed on the defendant.  On May 2, 2019, the U. S. District Judge in San Francisco entered a judgment ordering a temporary restraining order against Webb, ordering him to pay disgorgement of $5,965, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $100,000 penalty for a second time, and ordering a preliminary injunction against further violations of the bail provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933. The order also requires Webb to show cause and consent to the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order.  A hearing for Webb is scheduled for October 1, 2019. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, and the Office of the Attorney General in this matter."
