  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against four alleged co-conspirators in a scheme to deprive a stock proxy tabulation firm of the honest services of one of its employees.  The court found that the defendants violated the double jeopardy provision of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Charles Garske, Richard Gottcent, and Michael Sedlak consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the three co-defendants in a double jeopardy case brought by the SEC.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants sought a second trial, but the trial judge refused to permit them to testify, citing the \"manifest necessity\" provision of Rule 23(b)(2)(B) and the \"prejudgmental nature\" of the case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants, and a conduct-based injunction prohibiting the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the orders.  On July 17, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the New York District Court issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver and ordering the receiver to provide the receiver with the receiver's receiver.  Sansone and Sansone agreed to the appointment of a receiver and to the payment of a penalty equal to the amount of their relief. The receiver also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 5, 2018.  To learn more about double jeopardy, see Litigation Release No. 549 (1962).  The SEC's investigation was conducted by David J. Burt of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
