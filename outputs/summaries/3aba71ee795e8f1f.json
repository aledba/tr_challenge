  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against a New Mexico-based meat cutter who claimed that he left his position with Smith's Food and Drug Centers because of constant harassment by his supervisor.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Arturo Suazo, a former supervisor at Smith's, repeatedly called Rael \u201cold man\u201d and told Rael that he was moving too slow to do his job better and get it done faster.  The complaint alleges that, due to a workplace injury, Rael was unable to work as fast as younger employees or as quickly as Suazo demanded.  Rael ultimately resigned due to \"constant pressure\" from Suazo.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court held that Rael violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 301 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The court also found that, unlike Johnson, Suazo was not preempted by \u00a7 301 because he was acting within the course and scope of his employment at all material times.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico announced criminal charges against Suazo based on the same conduct alleged by Rael.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Mexico Secretary of State's Office, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
