  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment in favor of a New York City-based company that hired Angela Nicoletta as a supervisor to go over the company's arbitration agreements.  According to the court's order, Nicoletta signed the agreements without admitting or denying her allegations of violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The court also entered an order freezing Nicoletta's assets, freezing her assets, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $28,000 and $32,000, respectively.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Richmond, Virginia, charges Nicoletta with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Nicoletta.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order and entered a judgment permanently enjoining Nicoletta from violating the charged provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act. The court will consider the merits of the case upon motion by the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal court in Virginia on May 25, 2018.  An SEC complaint unsealed on May 26, 2018 alleges that Nicoletta violated Section 5(a) of Exchange Act Rule 12(b)(6) and (c) thereunder and Section 17(a)(2) of Securities Act Section 13(a).  The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 206 of the New York State Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), Nicoletta consented to the entry of an order suspending her from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and that she agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations. In addition, the complaint alleges that she signed the arbitration agreements in late November 2015, when she was told that she would have no problems working from New York and that all laws concerning the Agreements would apply to her at her current residence in New York.  Nicoletta also agreed to pay an $8,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years."
