  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New York-based company and its two former executives in a multi-million dollar fraud.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, from at least 2006 through 2012, New York City-based microcap company Aqualife USA, Inc. (AQUALife) and its former CEO, Vladislav Pustov, engaged in the practice of misclassification of regular workers as independent contractors.  According to the complaint, as part of this practice, the defendants were required to pay a thirty-five percent commission on all sales of water filtration systems.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants paid a five percent \"residual commission\" on each sales they made, which was deducted from the workers' salaries.  As alleged in the complaint:  The defendants were not required to file annual reports with the court, and the court found that they violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Separately, the SEC announced that it had obtained a court order freezing the assets of the defendants, freezing their assets, and imposing a civil penalty of $6.3 million.  On August 24, 2017, the Honorable Frank Wolf of the New York District Court entered a judgment against the defendants that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The court also ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $7,127.26, $24,000, and $48,320.89, respectively, to each of the relief defendants are entitled to, in the alternative, to a five-year officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar, and to a $20,000 officer- and director bar.  Finally, the court granted the defendants' motion for preliminary and permanent injunctions against further violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5a-14, and ordered them to disgorge their gains with prejudgment interest of $2,500."
