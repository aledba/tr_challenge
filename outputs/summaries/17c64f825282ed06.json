  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland today entered a final judgment in favor of Maryland's child pornography and obscenity laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that a 16-year-old Maryland girl sent a video of herself performing fellatio on a male in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, S.K. sent the video to two friends, A.T. and K.S., who were also allegedly involved in the dissemination of the video. The complaint further alleges that the video was sent in the form of a still picture, a still video, a magazine, a pamphlet, and a video game, and that the two friends shared the video with one another.  In a parallel action, the Maryland Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against the two teens for their roles in the distribution of child pornography.  To learn more about child pornography, see the SEC's Complaint on Child Abuse, Abuse, and Education, Abuse and Education Fraud, and the Cyber Unit's Investigation of Child Pornography. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office for Maryland, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Maryland Office of the Comptroller of Securities and Exchange Commission (OBSC) in this matter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties. The defendants have also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-registered securities firm. The settlements are subject to court approval.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-11-203 (2017).  The Court of Special Appeals also issued a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the anti-child pornography and related statutes, including Section 11-207(a)(4) and (c) the securities laws. The court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of these provisions, ordered a hearing on September 27, 2018, and issued an order appointing a receiver for the victims of the alleged internet-based child pornography that includes: (i) child pornography; (ii) internet access; (iii) instant messaging; (iv) search; (v) search"
