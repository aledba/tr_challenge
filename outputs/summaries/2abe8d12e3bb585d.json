  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska yesterday entered a temporary restraining order against Danielle O. and her husband, Robert M. on behalf of their daughter, Bella O.  The court found that Danielle violated the antifraud provisions of Section 42-903 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Nebraska on July 10, 2018, Danielle, who lives in Minnesota, allegedly engaged in a series of aggressive and aggressive actions at a duplex Danielle shared with her mother and brother, Neill and Nancy O. The complaint alleges that after Danielle left the duplex, she began to attack Neill, Nancy, and Neill O., and that Danielle followed her and began to throw and damage items downstairs. Danielle also allegedly kicked in a door, broke it off the frame, and tried to run outside with Neill. The SEC alleges that Danielle was not entitled to a protection order because she had only supervised visitation rights and was not permitted to take Bella anywhere without supervision due to Danielle\u2019s extensive drug and alcohol abuse and criminal history. The court also ruled that Danielle did not make any threats to the targets or recipients of the threat and that she was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the alleged incident.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Danielle.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Danielle consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Maria A. and Joseph G. Sansone of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy S. Cotter. The case is being supervised by Marc Blau. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Nebraska Department of Justice, and the Minnesota State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
