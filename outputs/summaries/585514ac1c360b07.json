The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, on July 13, 2018, SamirBenamor was arrested and charged with possession of an unregistered or improperly registered shotgun.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Tam has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any securities in the future. The judgment also orders Tam to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay an officer and director bar in the amount of $1,500.
