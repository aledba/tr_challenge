  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Michael Wolf, the former owner of the Monday Morning Quarterback, for defrauding his then-wife, Elizabeth Wolf, and others in connection with his fraudulent transfer of assets from one company to another.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Michael Wolf violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rules 5b-5(b) and (c) thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Michael Wolf failed to disclose to the court that he was transferring assets from Zig Zag Corp. to another entity wholly owned and controlled by his son, Scott Wolf, in order to satisfy Elizabeth Wolf's debts.  As alleged in the complaint, the trustee's claims were based on false claims about the value of the business and were not supported by the facts of the matter.  For example, the SEC alleges that, when Michael Wolf filed for bankruptcy in 2014, he was ordered to sell his home in Highland Park, New Mexico, to a third-party company wholly owned by the Debtor, which he then transferred to Elizabeth Wolf for temporary support and maintenance.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against the Wolfs.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Wolf has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Michael Wolf has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay disgorgement of $2,078, and prejudgment interest of $3,829, in a civil proceeding that is subject to court approval.  On May 26, 2020, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered the filing of a civil injunctive action.  A hearing for the final judgment is scheduled for June 21, 2020.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David A. Basinger and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Timothy J. Welshhans. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
