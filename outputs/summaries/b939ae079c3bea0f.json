  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a custody case that terminated his parental rights.  The court found that D.H., Sr., the presumed father of one of the defendants, had failed to show sufficient evidence to justify termination of parental rights without making an unfitness or detriment finding.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, the court terminated the father\u2019s parental rights in violation of Section 1516.5 of the federal child custody law.  As alleged in the court order, the father was not in a successful relationship with his children and had become a dependent of the court while in the custody of the other defendant.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the father of another defendant in the same case.  On March 24, 2019, the U. S. District Judge for the District of San Diego entered a judgment against the defendant, permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock in any future offering of penny stock.   The judgment also orders the court to determine whether to impose a permanent injunction, impose an officer-and-director bar, and impose a conduct-based injunction.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 539 (2014).  The SEC's Office of Advocacy and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice in this matter."
