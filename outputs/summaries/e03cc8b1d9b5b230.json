  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Social Security Administration against a former tax preparer who was found disabled by the agency.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Ms. Urena, a resident of Montefiore, New Jersey, was falsely told that she was able to perform simple, routine, one-to-two-step work tasks when, in fact, she had only moderate limitations in her ability to perform those tasks.  According to the complaint, however, the complaint alleges that she had developed a \"moderate impairment\" regarding her residual functional capacity, and that she frequently experienced \"panic attacks\" and \"mild physical limitations.\"  The complaint further alleges that, in reality, she was unable to perform these tasks because of her severe impairments.  In addition, the SEC alleges that in addition to experiencing anxiety and panic attacks, she also had a history of depression, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and injunctive relief.  Separately, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey announced criminal charges against Ms. United, her husband, and two other individuals in connection with the same criminal case.  On December 22, 2017, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans granted a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the federal securities laws and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  A hearing for the other defendants was scheduled for Jan. 24, 2018.  Judge Welshans also granted the SEC request for a temporary injunction against further violations.   The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General, and the Division of Health and Human Services' Office of Clinical Education and Advocacy. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Genier and supervised by Marc Blau, with assistance from Jennifer C. McKinley, and was supervised in the Office of Compliance and Regulatory Affairs. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Rawlings. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
