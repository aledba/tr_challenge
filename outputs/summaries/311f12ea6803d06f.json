  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of first-degree murder and armed criminal action following a jury trial.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, alleges that, on July 17, 2011, Gregory Gregory, III was shot and killed by an individual named Randolph Thornton, who claimed to have a dispute with a black male nicknamed \"Bird\" in the days before the murder.  According to the complaint, the jury found Gregory, who was seventeen years old at the time of the murder, liable for a sentence of life without the possibility for parole.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Gregory consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 565.033 of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of life imprisonment with the possibility of parole, plus prejudgment interest in the amount of the penalty.  Gregory also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the sale or purchase of any security, including the right to a penny stock, to purchase, hold, or sell any security at any time.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Gregory.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered a judgment permanently enjoining Gregory from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, ordering Gregory to pay civil penalties of up to $100,000, and imposing a mandatory minimum of five years in prison with the option of a $50,000 civil penalty, and requiring Gregory to surrender his passport and surrender to the authorities.   The court also issued an order suspending Gregory from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related case, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Gregory, charging him with violating Sections 565 and 565, and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil monetary penalties, and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.
