  "summary": "On July 12, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against a former employee of Southern California Permanente Medical Group (SCPMG) for failing to provide reasonable accommodations for her resignation.  The court found that SCPMG violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the company to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million.  According to the SEC's complaint, Featherstone, who was employed as an at-will employee, suffered from a \"temporary\" disability, which arose as a result of a \"relatively uncommon side effect of the medication\" she was taking in late December 2013; this \u201cadverse drug reaction\u201d allegedly caused Featherstone to suffer from an \"altered mental state.\u201d  The SEC alleges that Featherstone was not in her right mind when she resigned, because she was suffering from an adverse drug reaction and did not consider the employer\u2019s response to her resignation to be reasonable.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Featherstone.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the SEC has agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins Featherstone from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requires her to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Additionally, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Featherstone in a related administrative proceeding against another defendant.  On July 13, 2018, a federal district court in San Francisco issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order freezing Featherstone's assets and prohibiting her from associating with any third-party employer that may be liable for a finding of discrimination in the future.  A hearing on July 24, 2018 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Health and Human Services, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
