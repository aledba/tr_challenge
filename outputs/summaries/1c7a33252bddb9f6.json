  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a California state senator who has been charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, California, alleges that Senate Bill No. 277 (2015-2016) violated the federal and state laws governing immunization against childhood diseases.  As alleged in the complaint, the federal law requires that all school children be immunized against certain diseases, including vaccines that cause cancer.  In addition, the complaint alleges that mandatory vaccination as a condition of school admission does not violate the right to free exercise.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on April 22, 2016, a federal district court in the District of Columbia entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants from violating the federal, state, and local immunization laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a final judgement that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,078.95, prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,098.55, and a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2017, the U. S. District Judge in the Western District of New York entered a preliminary injunction against the proposed injunction, ordering the defendants to comply with the court's order, and ordering the injunction to be temporarily enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws. The court also granted the defendants' motion to withdraw their claims against the injunction, which was entered by the court on June 30, 2015, and entered by consent on July 1, 2016. The final judgment orders the injunction against further violations of these provisions and orders the court to determine whether to impose a permanent injunction against future violations.  A hearing is scheduled for May 26, 2017.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Los Angeles, alleging that the California Department of Public Health violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) of its Criminal Code, and Rules 5a-5 and (e) thereunder, and that the complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization."
