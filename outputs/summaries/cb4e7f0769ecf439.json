  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Jessica J. Janssen, a 15-year-old runaway from Iowa, who is charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Jessica alleges that, in April 2018, Jessica traveled from Iowa to Alaska to spend the summer with family friends. The complaint alleges that her mother misstated the date she had last seen Jessica and that this may have affected the validity of the missing person\u2019s report.  The complaint further alleges that Jessica was not a \"missing person\" and did not have the right to present her own evidence to the court.  As alleged in the complaint, Jessica also alleges that she was not allowed to present any evidence rebutting the ICJ Administrator's testimony.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California today announced criminal charges against Jessica.  On May 30, the court issued an order requiring the home state to consider whether Jessica was a \"voluntary return\" of a juvenile runaway. The order also required that the court consider whether or not the requisition paperwork was in order. The court's order also requires the court to consider the \"best interests\" of the juvenile.  Jessica's complaint charges that the order violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Jessica consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to return to her home state, and requires her to pay a $1,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Jessica and supervised by Marc Blau of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Jannsen and Ms. Blau. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Scott A. Thompson, John R. Rymas, and Patrick J. McCluskey of the Boston Regional Office, with assistance from Eric R. Werner of the Office of Advocacy and Advocacy for Children and Young Adults."
