  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a preliminary injunction against four former executives of a crane rental company for breaching their duty of loyalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Harvey Ray Graham, Kristian B. Bruu, Robbin O. Rainey, and Thomas Newell violated their duties of loyalty by entering into noncompetition covenants with AmQuip Crane Rental, LLC and Maxim Crane Works, L.P.  According to the complaint, Newell, who was employed as a branch manager of the Atlanta-based crane rental firm, provided his two best sales representatives with a copy of the company's confidential business information. The complaint alleges that, while employed as an employee, Graham, Bruu and Rainey communicated with Newell on a daily basis, including through email, through which they communicated about the crane rental needs of particular customers. Graham and Bruu also allegedly communicated through email that they had access to this information. In addition, the SEC alleges that Newell provided material assistance to one of the former executives in breaching his duty of duty to loyalty by helping another individual in breach of the covenants by signing a quote template to an intermediary, who in turn forwarded it to Newell.  In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained a temporary restraining order against Newell from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $50,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.  On May 9, 2017, the trial court granted the SEC's request for a final judgment ordering the entry of a temporary injunction against Graham and his companies, imposing a $75,000 civil penalty, and appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the receiver's receivership. The court also issued an order requiring the receiver to provide an accounting of any revenue generated by the receiver. The receiver has agreed to the payment of a $25,000 penalty, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the receiver has consented to entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the receiver and receiver to comply with the pre-judgment order. The receivership order is subject to the court's approval.  Newell and the receiver have agreed"
