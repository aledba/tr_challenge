  "summary": "On March 28, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan entered a final judgment against two defendants in a debt-collecting case.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Michigan, the defendants made false, inaccurate, or misleading representations in two requests for writs of garnishment that included post-judgment interest calculated at a rate not authorized by the court.  In one of those requests, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to comply with the court's orders and instead filed a civil action in federal court against the defendants.  As alleged in the complaint, defendants' injuries were caused by the defendants' violations of the anti-fraud provisions.  For example, the SEC alleges that, after defaulting in a state court judgment, defendants were able to collect tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest from the amount of judgment owed to the state-court plaintiff.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments that require them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount owed to them in the civil action.  Additionally, the court has issued a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendants from filing civil injunctions, imposing a penny stock bar, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Marc J. Ricchiute. The litigation will be led by Mary Jane M. Elliott. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Insurance, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.
