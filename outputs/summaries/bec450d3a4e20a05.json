  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Tavarius D. Radford, Jr., who was convicted of felony child endangerment for his role in M.R.'s death.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, from October 2011 through October 2013, Radford was charged with the unregistered and unregistered entry of a jury for the purpose of securing a fair trial.  The SEC alleges that, as a result of the defendant's conduct, he was unable to participate in the jury selection process because the courtroom could not accommodate over 90 potential jurors.  As alleged in the complaint, the jury deliberated for more than an hour before finding him guilty of the charges.  In its judgment, the court held that the defendant violated his right to a public trial by partially closing the courtroom during voir dire and, later in the trial, asking journalism students in the audience to find a seat or leave the courtroom.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On November 18, 2013, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against defendant, charging him with violating the pre-judgment provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordering a partial closure of the court's order-room during jury selection. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kelly L. Gibson, John R. Rymas, and Glenn S. Gordon of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Gordon. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission in this matter."
