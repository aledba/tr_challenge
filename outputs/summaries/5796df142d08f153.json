  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against Jason Michael Gibson, Jr., who was convicted of two felony counts of robbery, as a Level 3 felony, following a jury trial.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that Gibson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Gibson aided and abetted one or more of the defendants in committing the robberies.  Gibson also contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it entered judgment of conviction only on one of Gibson's inculpatory statements to law enforcement, which required only proof of the defendant's cooperation with police.  In addition, Gibson contends that, after Gibson and his friends left the house, they met with Deangelo Dove and Deziara Parker and discussed robbing Peck's house.  According to the complaint, Gibson and Dove then stole from the home televisions, a computer, an iPad, a cell phone, a vacuum cleaner, and tennis shoes.  At trial, Gibson told the jury that he and Dove had made a plan to rob Peck's home, that Dove had committed the robbery and that he had helped another man steal televisions from the house and she saw both men going through her jewelry.  He also allegedly claimed that Dove and Parker helped him steal the televisions and an iPad from his mother's home.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Gibson's conviction violated Section 14 of the Exchange Act, and he has agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Gibson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future. Gibson also agreed to be enjoined from future securities laws violations.  On May 30, 2017, Gibson pleaded guilty to one count of robbery and was sentenced to a total of 14 years in prison.  A jury deliberated for two hours before finding Gibson guilty on the other counts.   Gibson's sentencing hearing was conducted by James Taylor, Michael Griffin, and Michael Welshhans, and the case was supervised by Scott Gutierrez, all from the Fort Wayne Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Indiana State Attorney General's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
