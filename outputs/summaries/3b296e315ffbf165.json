  "summary": "On June 2, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of a New York-based attorney who agreed to pay $250,000 in attorney's fees to settle a civil action brought by a medical provider seeking to recover a $500,000 civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Brooklyn, New York, defendant Max Valerio, Esq., a former partner of the plaintiff's counsel's firm, prepared an attorney's brief for the trial court in which the litigation was conducted.  The complaint alleges that, as a matter of law, defendants are entitled to a reasonable hourly rate of $50 per hour based on the number of hours worked on the case.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendant failed to either timely pay or deny the claims.  In addition, the court found that the attorney's fee was unreasonable because it was not consistent with the agreed-upon hourly rate for the practice of no-fault law.   The court also found that, in the alternative, defendants could not afford to pay an attorney fee in excess of $500 per hour, because the attorney had no independent recollection and no contemporaneous time records.  Without admitting or denying the court's findings, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $750,000.  Additionally, defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to be ordered to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $850,000, which will be determined by the court at a later date.  Defendants also agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, and imposing civil penalties of $150,000 each.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On October 3, 2017 the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Manhattan, alleging that, among other things, that defendants failed to adequately disclose to the court that they had spent significant amounts of money preparing the case for trial.  Specifically, the complaint alleged that defendants spent approximately 20 hours doing research and drafting the case file, and spent approximately 10 hours preparing the motion for leave to appeal to the Appellate Division."
