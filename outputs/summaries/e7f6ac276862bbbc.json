  "summary": "On August 31, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against a New Jersey resident who filed a complaint in federal court in Newark, N.J., alleging that the New Jersey state securities laws violated the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, alleges that New Jersey residents can place account wagers with the Securities and Exchange Commission without having to be physically located outside the state to place wagers.  According to the complaint, in 1998, the New York State Securities Commission issued an order requiring the SEC to issue an administrative rule allowing New Jersey-based account holders to place bets on live or simulcast running and harness horse races while located within the state.  In its order, the SEC alleges that the SEC violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, New Jersey and the SEC consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and (e) the books and records provisions of Section 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(c)(3)(B). The final judgment permanently enjoins the SEC from violating these provisions and orders New Jersey to comply with the Commission's order. The final judgments also order the Commission to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael Vukcevich and supervised by Jennifer Chun Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities Division, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Federal Commodities Futures Trading Commission. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Office of Regulatory Affairs also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of online gambling.
