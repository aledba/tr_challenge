  "summary": "On March 24, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment against Pet Supermarket Inc., a Florida-based pet care supply retail chain, for violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that, from at least December 2017 through June 2018, PetSupermarket sent him seven unauthorized telemarketing and advertising text messages.  According to the complaint, the texts were intended to encourage people to attend an adoption event, adopt a pet, or purchase products for their care.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, the text messages did not constitute a concrete injury.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the texts \"invaded\" the plaintiff's seclusion and solitude, depleted his cell phone battery, and caused him to incur a usage allocation deduction to his text messaging or data plan.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against PetSuperMarket.   \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Spokeo and supervised by Marc J. Ricchiute. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
