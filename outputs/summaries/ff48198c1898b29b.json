  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Preston Wright, who was convicted of one count of first-degree sodomy, victim under twelve years old, and resulting forty-year sentence.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, Wright was convicted on two counts of sodomizing his then-girlfriend\u2019s five-year-old daughter, Tammy.  The SEC alleges that the trial court improperly dismissed a juror as the alternate instead of granting a guilty or not guilty verdict based on the facts and circumstances surrounding her dismissal.  As alleged in the complaint, Wright also failed to disclose to the jury that he had a sister-in-law who was a grade ahead of him in school, and that she hugged her father during the deliberation.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Wright did not tell the jury whether he was going to vote for a mistrial or not, because he did not believe the jury had reached a verdict.  Finally, the SEC alleges in its complaint that Wright violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Wright consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Wright also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $5,000, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000 for each defendant convicted of a related felony.  Additionally, Wright agreed to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from associating with anyone other than his sister in the company of which he was a member.  He also agreed not to participate in the jury selection process for the rest of the trial.  On May 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of Mississippi entered a temporary restraining order against Wright, ordering him to comply with the court's order, and appointing a receiver to oversee the selection of a jury. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. McKinly. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Georgia, and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission."
