The SEC's complaint alleges that Larry Gale Wells entered into a contract with Larry Wells to build a fence around his home located at 104 Linest Drive in Houma. According to the complaint, Wells provided Wells with a check for a down payment of $8,000. The complaint further alleges that Wells did not complete the work under the contract, and Wells ultimately hired someone else to complete the fence.  As alleged, Wells allegedly spent the rest of the money on the fence, which he claimed he did not do because he was short-staffed and could not read and understand the English language.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Central District of New York today entered a final judgment against Wells permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Wells to pay a penalty of five years imprisonment at hard labor.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Wells consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $2,700.00 plus prejudgment interest of $1,500.00 and a civil penalty of three years imprisonment.
