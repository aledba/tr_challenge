  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against Steven Seeger Jr., a New Mexico-based attorney who was convicted of two counts of aggravated battery against a household member following a jury trial in which his attorney refused to participate.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on March 10, 2017, Seeger entered his appearance as defense counsel for Defendant on the basis that, among other things, the State had filed its disclosures and witness list late and that Seeger had not yet had the chance to respond to it.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the judge's refusal to participate in the jury selection, the jury found Seeger liable for a second-degree felony and ordered him to be permanently barred from appearing as an attorney.  Seeger agreed to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and agreed to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a temporary restraining order prohibiting him from participating in the trial.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico announced criminal charges against Seeger, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 15 of the New Mexico securities laws. Seeger also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is twice the amount of his legal fees.  On March 13, 2018, the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered Seeger to comply with the court's order, and scheduled a hearing for March 14, 2017 to determine whether to proceed with a retrial. The court also granted the request for a hearing on March 11, 2017. The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Office of the District Judge and supervised by Marc Blau, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
