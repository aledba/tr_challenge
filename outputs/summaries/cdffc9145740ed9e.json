  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment in favor of a company that manufactures and sells water recreation boards.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that, in 2013, Appellee Nash Manufacturing, Inc. (\"ZUP\") and its founder, Keith Parten, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, ZUP and Nash agreed to settle the case by agreeing to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000 and a civil penalty of $5,000.  ZUP also agreed to pay a $20,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Nash and ZUP have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining each of them from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, and imposing a $25,000 penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York today announced criminal charges against ZUP, Nash, and Parten in connection with the alleged violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-2, and 13b3-3 thereunder, and ordering ZUP to pay $10 million and a $5 million civil penalty in the parallel criminal case.  Additionally, the court granted ZUP's motion for summary judgment against Nash, which is pending final approval by the court.   The court also granted the company's request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Virginia Department of Commerce in this matter."
