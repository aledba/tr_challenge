  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Ford Motor Company v. McKenzie, finding that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 998 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, in April 2013, McKenzie submitted a motion for a partial settlement in which he agreed to pay $28,350 in attorney fees and court costs.  According to the complaint, the settlement offer included numerous extraneous provisions, including a provision requiring that McKenzie waive certain of his reasonable fees and costs, and requiring him to submit a written discovery in the wake of Ford's initial offer to compromise.  In addition, the complaint alleges that after receiving the initial offer, McKenzie's two attorneys billed for \"many\" hours of duplicative work, which the court deemed unreasonable, requiring McKenzie to continue working on the case.  As a result, the court awarded McKenzie no additional fees for the period following the initial settlement offer, and instead awarded him a one-cent increase in fees.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by agreeing to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to two times their fees, and orders McKenzie to pay an attorney fee in the amount of $25,000, which is equal to the amount he has already incurred in pursuing that fee motion.  On the same day that the court issued its judgment, it issued a temporary restraining order against McKenzie, freezing his assets, and ordering him to pay civil penalties of $15,000 and $2,500, respectively.  It also ordered McKenzie to refrain from disclosing the details of his settlement offer to anyone, including members of the press or legal reporting services, owner or prospective owners of vehicles distributed by Ford, and to not participate in any act or practice constituting a violation of Business and Professions Code Section 1793.26.  Additionally, it ordered him to comply with the court's order that he pay a $20,000 civil penalty, which he has not yet complied with, and that he will not comply with in any way with the agreed-upon settlement.   The court also ordered that McKenzie comply with an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an asset freeze or a cease-and-desist order, ordering that the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver.  Finally, the receiver agreed to a five-year officer and director bar and to a penny-per-day suspension. "
