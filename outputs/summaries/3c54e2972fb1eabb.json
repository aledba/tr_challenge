  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Washington announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against Jennifer K. Rios, alleging that she avoided and refused to serve as the secretary of state of Washington because she could not be found for purposes of service of process.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 28, 2012, Rios was driving eastbound on the West Seattle Bridge when she was rear-ended by a Honda Civic.  The complaint alleges that Rios refused to open the door and accept service from the person driving the car.  Rios allegedly told the process server that she was unable to find her because she did not know Rios's new address.  As alleged in the complaint, the complaint further alleges that after a due and diligent search and repeated attempts to serve Rios at her last known Washington address, she re-arrested her car and the cars were towed.  In a parallel action, on January 23, 2017, a federal district court in Seattle entered a temporary restraining order against Rios and ordered her to surrender her passport.  On February 13, 2018, the U. S. District Court for the Western District of New York entered a final judgment against Rio, ordering her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering her return to the United States.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Seattle Police Department, and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
