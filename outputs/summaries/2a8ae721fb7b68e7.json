  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Melissa Robitille, a mother of a child with holoprosencephaly, for her role in the death of her son.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on August 21, 2014, defendant, Walter Richters, a pediatric endocrinologist, and his wife, Sarayu Balu, raised the issue of whether the court should permit cross-examination of the defendant without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  According to the complaint, Richters agreed to participate in a jury trial by agreeing to be subject to the court's approval of the final judgment.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the jury should determine whether to impose a penalty based on the amount of time Richters had to be confronted with the witnesses.

The SEC filed civil injunctions against further violations of the \"conservation rule\" and ordered Richters to be barred from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney. The court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, and a hearing has been scheduled for September 5, 2018. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being"
