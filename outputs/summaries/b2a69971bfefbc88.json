  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a Philadelphia-based flight attendant who was injured while riding an airport shuttle bus to an employee parking lot after her shift ended.  The court's order, which was entered on April 27, 2016, permanently enjoins US Airways from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 301(c)(1) of the federal workers' compensation law, and orders US Airways to pay a one-time administrative fee to cover the cost of airport parking.  According to the order, Bockelman, who was a member of the Association of Flight Attendants, claimed that, at the time of her injury, US Airways was responsible for providing either free or reimbursed parking for flight attendants at their domicile airports.  In reality, the complaint alleges that, unlike the employer in Epler, the Division of Aviation did not require employees to park in the employee parking lots or shuttle service.  Instead, the court held that the employees were not required to use the employees' lot and shuttle lot.  As a result of the court's ruling, the company was unable to provide any reasonable means of access to the employee's lot or shuttle lot for its employees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the airline consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating these provisions, ordering the company to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, and imposing an officer-and-director bar, as well as an officer and director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by David B. Torrey and Andrew E. Green of the Philadelphia Regional Office, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by David Birkenheier and Amy Gwiazda of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office."
