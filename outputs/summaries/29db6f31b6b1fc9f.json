  "summary": "On February 15, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against the City of Houston in a civil action brought by the Texas Attorney General's Office.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that the Texas attorney general's office obtained a temporary restraining order against the city from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 271 of the Texas Local Government Code.  According to the complaint, the court granted the city's request for an asset freeze and other emergency relief.  In a parallel action, the Texas Secretary of State's Office today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in Texas against a city for violating the federal securities laws, including Section 271.152 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the city consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders the city to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On February 16, 2018, the Honorable William W. Ochse of the United States District Court in Texas granted the relief sought by the city of Houston and the District Attorney's Office of Texas, including an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, ordering the receiver to provide an accounting of all the receiver's assets, and appointing an officer and director of a municipal district court.  Oechse also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of an SEC-registered broker-dealer for the purpose of recovering investor funds from the receiver.   The court also granted the City's motion for an emergency asset freeze, which was instituted in the wake of the September 13, 2017 announcement that the receiver had been suspended from providing services to the city. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Public Health and Human Services in this matter."
