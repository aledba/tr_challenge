  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Jeffrey and Lauren Sardis in a shareholder's derivative action against JLAJ Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation owned by Lauren and Jeffrey Sardis.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from September 2008 through September 2014, Jeffrey and his wife, Lauren, dissolved AETEA, Inc. (\"AETEA\") and planned to liquidate it.  According to the complaint, the Sardis and their company, SCCC Holdings Corporation (\"SCCC\"), planned to sell all or substantially all of the assets of the company to Jeffrey, or to a company owned by or affiliated with him, in a \"sweetheart\" deal.  As alleged, the defendants' dissolution and petition for the appointment of a receiver were events of default and a breach of the securities agreement.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to establish that Jeffrey breached the broker-dealer registration provisions of article 3 of the Stockholders Agreement and that, by refusing to cooperate with the dissolution and winding-up, Jeffrey deprived Lauren of her entitlement to attorney's fees under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Jeffrey has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $500,000, which is equal to the amount of his salary, and requires him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest of $150,000.  Jeffrey has also agreed to pay $65,000 in counsel fees, which will be offset by his salary at the time of the final judgment.  On November 24, 2014, the court entered a judgment ordering Jeffrey to consent to and consent to the issuance of a cease-and-desist order, ordering him to cease and desist from soliciting or purchasing any securities in the future, and requiring him to engage an independent investment bank to expedite the closing of the SCCC Note.   The court also ordered Jeffrey to comply with an order appointing a receiver appointed by the Delaware Chancery Court, which requires Jeffrey to pay disgorgement of $650,000 plus prejudgment interests of $75,000 and a $50,000 civil penalty.  Finally, on September 7, 2016, the Court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order against Jeffrey from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered him to participate in an asset freeze and in a related administrative proceeding. The court's order also prohibits Jeffrey from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities without the prior written consent of the receiver."
