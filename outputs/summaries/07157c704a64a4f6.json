  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois on May 15, 2017, entered a final judgment against defendant John V. Norris, Jr. of Joliet, Illinois, that permanently restrains his statutory summary suspension of driving privileges.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Will County, Illinois on April 13, 2017 in Chicago, defendant Robert M. Mau, a Joliet Police Department officer, failed to read the Miranda warning to motorist while performing a stop-and-go traffic stop on April 14, 2017.  The complaint alleges that Mau failed to comply with the requirements of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he was not entitled to a hearing on a motion to rescind the suspension.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mau.  On June 21, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Mau, freezing his assets, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Mau consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering a hearing to be held within 30 days of the court's order, and imposing a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The court also ordered Mau to provide a copy of the booking room video, which he provided to the court.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of driving while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage, warning investors to be aware of the risks associated with driving while impaired."
