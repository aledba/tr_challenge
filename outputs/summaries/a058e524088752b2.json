  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a class action action brought by two California residents, Jorge Vargas and Guadalupe Carcamo, who were among the first to allege that a car dealership violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, defendants agreed to settle the case by agreeing to arbitration without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  The SEC alleges that the arbitration provision is procedurally unconscionable because it requires both parties to pay a reasonable amount of the fees and arbitrator fees.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants were not required to initial and sign the arbitration contract, which is not subject to arbitration.  Instead, defendants were required to pay, in part, $1,500 in arbitration fees and $6,000 in pre-judgment interest.  As a result, the SEC alleges, defendants did not have the opportunity to finalize the arbitration agreement before it was entered into, and defendants were unable to afford to pay the arbitration fees or the hearing fee.  Finally, the court found that defendants failed to disclose the arbitration clause on the back of the contract when they signed the contract, and that defendants could not afford to arbitrate the arbitration without paying the fees or arbitrators' fees. The court also ruled that defendants had the right to request an injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (c) thereunder, to determine whether to impose an injunction or to issue an order requiring a court to order an injunction.  On the same day that the court entered an order imposing an injunction, Defendants filed a civil injunctive action against each of them, charging them with violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Section 17 (a)(2) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder of the Exchange Act. Defendants also agreed to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to be permanently enjoined from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws.  Defendants also consented to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating these provisions, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, sale, or sale of any securities law. The judgments also require defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000, $50,000 or $75,000. The settlements are subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led"
