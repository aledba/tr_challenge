  "summary": "On March 23, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action against ITT Educational Services, Inc., a for-profit education company, and its former Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Kinser, alleging that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, in 2009, ITT raised funds by issuing senior debt to private investors and failing to disclose material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting.  According to the complaint, in 2013 and 2014 ITT and its private student loan program failed to disclose significant weaknesses in the financial health of the private student loans it provided to investors.  ITT's financial performance and stock price declined due to declining enrollment at the time.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged scheme.  On March 24, 2017, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert witness.  A hearing for the SEC is scheduled for July 9, 2018.  To learn more about SEC insider trading, see Investor.gov/Securities.
