  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found liable for breach of contract in a civil action brought by his former employer, NextG Networks, Inc.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 9, 2009, a jury found NextG liable in contract damages based on the jury's finding that the company had breached the contract provisions of the contract.  The SEC alleges that the jury found that NextG had failed to adequately consider the value of the company's options and failed to determine the amount of lost earnings owed to the company.  In addition, the court found that plaintiff had sustained lost earnings of $73,522, which was insufficient to justify a new trial.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the federal securities laws and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, which is equal to the amount that he lost in his previous employment.  As alleged, the jury did not find the company liable for any of the alleged violations of contract provisions, and instead awarded a judgment that imposed a permanent injunction and ordered NextG to pay $326,250 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.   The court's order also prohibits the defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the settlement of a settled civil action, and prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for which he has an officer-and-director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's order against NextG requires the court to determine whether it is entitled to a fair trial based on whether it has sufficient evidence to determine liability for the defendant's conduct.  For example, the SEC previously issued an order requiring the jury to consider whether the company violated the contract provision of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and requires the defendant to provide a copy of the Exchange Act to the jury as part of its investigation.  It also requires the trial court to decide whether to impose a civil monetary penalty against the defendant based upon the jury finding.  On the same day the SEC issued its final judgment, it issued a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the securities laws, ordering the defendants to pay civil monetary penalties of $325,000 and $1,500, respectively, for each of the defendants' violations of Exchange Act Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) and (3)"
