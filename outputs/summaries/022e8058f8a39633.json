  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Social Security Administration against Jennifer M. Aguilar, a California resident who claimed that she was disabled due to chronic back pain, bipolar disorder, asthma, and stress.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Aguilar and ordered her to return to work.  According to the SEC's complaint, Aguilar filed a complaint in the U. S. District court for the Northern District of California on June 17, 2014, alleging that she suffered from severe anxiety and panic attacks. The complaint alleges that Aguilar was regularly described as cooperative and pleasant by her mental health providers and she did not appear to have any difficulty interacting with those present at the hearing.  Aguilar also allegedly had increased symptoms related to situational stressors, and she remained active performing activities of daily living and caring for five minor children on her own.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced that it filed a parallel criminal action against the defendant, charging her with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $10,000. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and supervised by Jennifer J. Fellabaum. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
