  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment in a case brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois against a group of egg producers accused of price-fixing.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on October 4, 2016, the defendants, Appellee United Egg Producers, Inc. (\u201cUEP\u201d) and Illinois Brick, Inc., allegedly violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to the defendants' claims, UEP and UEP did not have antitrust standing to sue for overcharges for egg products made with non-conspirator eggs, and that UEP had no standing to do so.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Economic and Risk Analysis (OIEA) today announced that it has issued a preliminary injunction against the defendants from further violations of the federal securities laws.  OIEA's complaint charges UEP with violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  UEP has agreed to settle the case against it by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of Exchange Act Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $111 million. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois Attorney General's Office in this matter."
