  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in favor of a Texas-based real estate investment trust and its trustee in a related action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that, on April 18, 2007, Greenpoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. (\"Greenpoint\"), a registered representative of Greenpoint, fraudulently foreclosed on the property for the purchase of commercial real estate in the amount of $1.725 million, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The complaint alleges that Greenpoint and Katz misrepresented to Greenpoint that there would be no deficiency owed on the loan after the foreclosure sale, and that the Greenpoint representative represented that a potential buyer would purchase the property at a price sufficient to satisfy the outstanding debt.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to show sufficient evidence to support their claims.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Texas today announced criminal charges against Greenpoint.  On December 14, 2017, the court granted the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the trustee to respond to the SEC\u2019s request for a hearing on the merits of the matter. The court also granted the trustee the opportunity to respond, without providing any evidence, to show that the trustee acted in breach of the duty to disclose and that he acted in reliance on the representations.   The court agreed to a final judgment that permanently enjoins the trustee from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against the trustee. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Banking and Securities, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
