  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against four former employees of the Department of Energy for defrauding the agency by failing adequately to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) prior to constructing a highway.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 1, 1993, Louis Lanier worked for a contractor that stationed him at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. The complaint alleges that, while employed at the plant, Lanier developed beryllium, which is not a medical condition, and that he developed CBD as a result of working there.  The complaint further alleges that the district office declined to issue a recommended decision regarding Lanier's CBD claim and instead issued a letter to Vander Boegh stating that it would not review the EIS unless the agency had already reviewed the claim.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the employees consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the employees to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General (OIG) today announced criminal charges against Lanier. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Robert F. Lanier, Rose M. Gough, and Patricia L. Renfrow. The litigation will be led by Robert Lanier and Rose Gough. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the OIG's Market Abuse Unit. The examination that led to the investigation was performed by John Rymas and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The investigation was supervised by Eric R. Werner and Glenn S. Gordon of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, with the assistance of the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations' Risk Analysis Task Force."
