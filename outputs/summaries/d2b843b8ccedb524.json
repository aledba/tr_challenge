  "summary": "On May 18, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia entered a final judgment in favor of the cities of Atlanta, Hahira, Lake Park, Remerton, and Valdosta in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that the city of Atlanta and its commissioner, Camila Knowles, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 36-70-27 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Knowles and the DCA Board Members were not entitled to mandamus relief because they were not named as a party in the SDS Act.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Knowles violated the broker-dealer registration provision of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Atlanta Regional Office, with the assistance of the Atlanta Office of Financial Regulation, and the Office of the Secretary of State's Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance and cooperation of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Georgia Office of Inspector General, the Atlanta Police Department, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Alabama Department of Education, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Ga., and the Georgia Department of Commerce."
