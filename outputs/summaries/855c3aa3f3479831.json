  "summary": "On May 6, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Facebook, Inc. (\"Facebook\"), a social networking company, and its founder, Nimesh Patel, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 15b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Facebook unlawfully collected and stored biometric information from over one billion U. S. residents.  According to the complaint, the defendants used Facebook's \"Tag Suggestions\" program to create and store digital representations of people's faces based on the geometric relationship of facial features unique to each individual.  As the complaint alleges, these representations are \"unlike other unique identifiers\" that are uniquely unique to the individual; therefore, when compromised, the individual has no recourse, is at heightened risk for identity theft, and is likely to withdraw from biometric-facilitated transactions.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Facebook agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against Patel, Pezen, and Licata.  On May 9, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Patel and Pezen.   The complaint charges Facebook with violating Section 15 of the Exchange Act, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Separately, on May 10, the federal district court for the Western District of New York entered a preliminary injunction against the defendants from further violations of BIPA, and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Attorney General's Office, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
