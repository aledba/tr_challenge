  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New York-based bank for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, prior to 2008, certain types of funds were exempt from restraint or execution, such as Social Security benefits, public assistance, unemployment insurance, pension payments, and the like.  According to the complaint, however, defendants were not entitled to a private right of action.  Instead, the complaint alleges that defendants were held liable for violations of the federal and state securities laws.  In addition, defendants alleged that, when restraining notices were sent to the bank, the bank nonetheless restrained the funds in their accounts, and charged them related bank fees, in violation of the EIPA.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against the bank.  On May 24, 2013, the Honorable Kathleen M. Sullivan of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit entered a judgment against the judgment debtor, ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $2,500, and ordering the bank to pay $1,740 in disgorging and prejudgment interests of $3,500.   The judgment debtor's settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the New York Office of the Attorney General's Office and the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.N. Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Justice, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the FBI, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority and the Financial Market Abuse Authority."
