  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on March 22, 2018, entered a final judgment against Raymond deLevie, M.D., a resident of Foxdale Retirement Community, which provides 24 hour skilled nursing care and assistance with daily activities.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and appointing an alternative health care agent to be their attorney.  According to the court's order, filed on June 29, 2017, the trial court entered an order enjoining Appellant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  In its order, the court granted the defendants' request for a preliminary injunction and appointed an attorney to represent them in the matter.  On August 31, 2017 and October 23,2017, the defendants agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains the status of their health care power of attorney, and requires the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, defendants consented to entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties of up to $1.5 million, and imposing a $500,000 civil penalty against each of them.   The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the final judgments, and to be barred from serving as an attorney for a period of five years.  As a result of the settlement, defendants will not be able to reapply for the same amount of money they paid to settle the SEC's charges against them, and defendants will be required to pay a penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5454 (March 22, 2017).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment.  Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
