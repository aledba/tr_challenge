  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment granting the SEC's request for an asset freeze against Shannon Scott, a South Carolina resident accused of orchestrating a series of high-level domestic violence cases.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Scott was confronted by two vehicles while he was asleep at a party at a teen nightclub with friends.  According to the complaint, Scott told his daughter, Teesha Davis, that he was being chased by the two vehicles, and that when Scott fired the warning shot, the SUV followed, followed, and followed Scott's daughter and her friends into the house.  As alleged in the complaint:  Scott was asleep in his home when he heard a gunshot and saw the headlights of the SUV driving in the opposite direction.  When Scott confronted the two cars, he fired a warning shot \"straight in the air\" and yelled not to come any closer.  He then retrieved his roommate's gun and \"ran\" toward the front of the house, where he saw two vehicles driving in opposite directions.  Scott then allegedly fired another warning shot at the SUV, which he knew was coming from the other direction and \"instigated the deadly circumstances.\"  The court found Scott had no reasonable means of avoiding the danger of losing his own life or sustaining serious bodily injury and ordered Scott to stand his ground and repel the attack with as much force as he could.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against Scott.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Dickey of the Umpqua Regional Office in Charlotte entered an order granting Scott a temporary restraining order against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering Scott to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500, and a $100,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Scott consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any security deposit that may be required of a security deposit in the amount of $500,000.   The order also granted Scott the right to return to his home and deposit the deposit into escrow.  A hearing on May 25, 2018 was scheduled for"
