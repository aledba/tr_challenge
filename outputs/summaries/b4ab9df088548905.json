  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a former school bus monitor for his role in a fraudulent scheme to conceal his condition.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Timothy C. Scallen of Oak Park, Michigan, failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his motion for summary judgment.  According to the complaint, from October 2015 through August 2018, the SEC's Office of Inspector General (OIG) issued a report and recommendation that the Court grant summary judgment in part and deny the Commission's recommendation in part. The complaint alleges that the Commission found that Plaintiff had suffered a severe impairment of his ability to perform his work as school bus monitors, and that he was unable to perform any of the work required for a disability finding.  In addition, the complaint alleged that he had had a heart attack in October 2015, had a stroke in June 2016, and had a severe case of cardiomyopathy in June 2017.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission&rsquo;s complaint, the Commission agreed that Plaintiff should be entitled to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The Commission also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On October 24, 2018, a federal district court in New York entered a temporary restraining order against the Commission from further violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the Commission to conduct an examination that will determine whether the Commission has sufficient evidence for a determination of whether a person qualifies as a disabled person under the Social Security Act.  A hearing scheduled for October 26, 2018 was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. Eastern time.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Bledsoe of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Chedly. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Michigan Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission\u00c2\u00a0has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0report\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0successor.\u00c2\u00a0finds\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0you\u00c2\u00a0are uniquely qualified to invest\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0an investment in\u00c2\u00a0a business"
