  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a domestic violence case who was convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, on October 16, 2014, a woman named Theresa Gail Scanlan told the SEC that she and her husband, Leroy Bagnell, had met at a bar and had been introduced to the woman as a friend. The complaint alleges that the woman told her husband that he had been hit with a candlestick, a broom, and a hammer over multiple occasions, and that she had been restrained by her husband. The SEC alleges that, contrary to these statements to the contrary, the woman's statements to her husband were testimonial because they were meant to identify the abuser in order to protect the victim from future attacks.  The SEC also alleges that Bagnel had signed waivers allowing the police to obtain his medical records, which were not in dispute with the nature and extent of the injuries. The court also found that Bignell had signed a third-factor test that, while not subject to the confrontation clause of the federal securities laws, was insufficient to support an unlawful imprisonment conviction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced that it filed criminal charges against Scanlan.  On November 19, 2015, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action and obtained a temporary restraining order, which temporarily enjoins the defendant from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and orders the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the sale or issuance of any security or other security measure.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws and ordering him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (2014).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Skjonsby. The case is being supervised by"
