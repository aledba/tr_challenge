  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered summary judgment in favor of Liberty Lighting Company, Inc., a company that was liquidating and dissolving its pension plan.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Liberty Lighting was not a contributing sponsor of the pension plan when it filed for bankruptcy in 1991.  According to the complaint, in 2012, Liberty Lighting filed for Chapter 13 of the federal pension plan, which is subject to bankruptcy, and its owner, Mr. Wortley, went through a personal bankruptcy.  Liberty Lighting's pension plan was terminated in 2012 and the company was unable to collect pension payments.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that the company's dissolution did not prevent it from taking over the administration of the plan for a period of twenty-one years.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, the company did not notify the court of its dissolution until after it had ceased to exist in 2012.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint's complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the court granted partial summary judgment against Liberty Lighting on the basis of its compliance with the federal securities laws, and ordered Liberty Lighting to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $150,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion by the parties.    In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against the defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related administrative proceeding, the Court issued a temporary restraining order against certain companies in violation of the ERISA provisions, including Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Findlay Indus., Inc., and Don's Trucking Co., Ltd., which are subject to the same requirements as Liberty Lighting.
