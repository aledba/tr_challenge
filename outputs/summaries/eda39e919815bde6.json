  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington today entered a final judgment against Dovex Fruit Co., Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based agricultural company, for violating the federal minimum wage law.  According to the court's order, Dovex and its co-defendants agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering Dovex to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, charges Dovex with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Dovex has agreed to a settlement where it will be permanently enjoined from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and to pay an officer and director bar and a penny-per-day bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 3, 2017, the Honorable Margaret S. McCole granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction, entered an order appointing a receiver, and appointed a receiver for Dovex. The receiver will determine the amount of compensation to be paid to the receiver."
