  "summary": "On December 10, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans entered a final judgment in favor of Officer Sherome Hankton, a New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) officer who was injured while guarding a NOPD prisoner during a hospital stay.  According to the SEC's complaint, on November 24, 2009, while Hankton was guarding Mr. Jackson at University Hospital in New Orleans, he attacked her, stabbing and biting her several times.  The complaint alleges that the trial court improperly allocated the right percentage of fault to Officer Hankton for the injuries she sustained during the attack.  In its judgment, the court found that the amount of fault was reasonable, and that the jury was entitled to a judgment ordering the award of a total of $250,552.49 in future medical expenses.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hankton consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,134,287.44 plus judicial interest, and a $165,484.95 officer-and-director bar.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Harold A. Asher, CPA, LLC, and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the UOPD, the New Orleans Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Louisiana Department of Health and Human Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
