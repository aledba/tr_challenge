  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on February 22, 2019, entered a final judgment in favor of the United States seeking a temporary restraining order halting the release of Guantanamo Bay detainee Khalid Ahmed Qassim, who has been held at Guantanamo Bay since September 11, 2001.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Guantanamo Bay on February 21, 2002 and unsealed on February 24, 2018, Qassims, who is from Yemen, alleges that, as a result of his detention at Guantanamo, the government has been unable to obtain a court order granting him the right to a habeas corpus hearing without violating the due process provisions of the federal due process laws.  The complaint further alleges that the court's judgment in Kiyemba did not consider that the government had a duty to detain the detainees at Guantanamo and that it had no right to revoke their right to due process.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has issued an order suspending the detention of the Guantanamo Bay detainees pending final judgments that permanently enjoin the government from violating the Due Process Clause of the First and Second Amendments, and orders the government to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court has agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining the detention from future violations of those provisions, and ordering the repatriation of the detainees.  On February 26, 2020, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court against the government, alleging that, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service, and a penny stock bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and supervised by Marc Blau of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Graham Loomis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the United Nations Office of Inspector General, and the United Kingdom Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of International Affairs encourages the public to check the background of anyone who has filed a legal action by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov website\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to identify whether there are any conflicts of interest."
