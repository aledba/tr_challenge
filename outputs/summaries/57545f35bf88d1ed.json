  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against defendants Robert A. Burns, Michael C. Spitz, Matthew Kamps, Bertrand Thibault, Michael Champrenault, Daniel Moore, and Nicolas Pelfrene in a civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Michigan on February 12, 2016, Burns and Spitz raised the issue of whether defendants had caused Robert's injuries or died of them.  The complaint alleges that defendants assaulted and battered Robert during an outing at Muskegon Lake in 2014, and that defendants' actions were consistent with an intentional drowning.  In addition, the SEC alleges that the defendants had a history of physical and mental abuse, including an assault, battery, and death of a child.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Burns consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his civil penalty.  Spitz agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Gresley.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Michigan Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Michigan Office of Inspector General in this matter."
