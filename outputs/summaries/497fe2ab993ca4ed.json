  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico today entered a final judgment in favor of D\u00edaz-Rivera, a Puerto Rican citizen who pleaded guilty to drug-trafficking charges and was sentenced to 180 months in prison.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on March 24, 2017 in federal court in San Juan, Puerto Rico, a federal district court in Puerto Rico issued an order imposing an upwardly variant sentence on D\u00edazo.  The SEC alleges that the court improperly relied on the defendants' prior convictions for drug possession and possession of a firearm, and that it improperly weighted the defendants's prior convictions against them.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in fashioning the sentence, the court did not consider the defendant's prior felony convictions and instead relied on his prior convictions as well as his prior felony conviction for possession of marijuana, Percocet, Xanax, and a gun modified to fire automatically.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, a $50,000 civil penalty, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Fernando Torres of San Juan entered a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to be enjoined from violating Section 3553(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C) and imposing a penalty of 180 months.  Judge Torres granted the court's request for a temporary restraining order and a temporary injunction, and ordered him to return to Puerto Rico to reside and work as a resident of the United States.  He also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar, with the right to reapply after five years of incarceration.  D\u00edraz also agreed not to participate in the 500-hour drug treatment program offered by the Bureau of Prisons, which is required by the federal law.  As a result of the settlement with the District Court, the amount of his prison sentence will be determined by the court at a later date upon motion of the court.  For further information, see United States v. Rodriguez-Rodr\u00edguez-Reyes, 925 F.3d 1, 9 n.8 (1st Cir. 2016).  The Court also granted the request for an expedited hearing on May 9, 2018 and a hearing on June 13, 2018."
