  "summary": "On May 3, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the New York State Attorney General's Office (\"AGO\"), finding that the AGO violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, from at least May 2001 through May 2011, the AGAs violated the federal securities laws by failing to apply the catalyst theory in granting attorneys' fees.  According to the complaint, as a result of this lapse in judgment, AGAs were not entitled to recover fees from AGAs, and AGAs had to show a greater degree of success than their federal counterpart.  In addition, the complaint alleges that AGAs did not have the resources to deal with AGAs' long-standing problems.  As a result, the court's final judgment, which permanently enjoins AGAs from violating the above-mentioned provisions, orders AGAs to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their fees, and orders the Attorney General to appoint a receiver to determine the appropriate amount of fees to be awarded to each party.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the attorney general consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay an officer and director of a public company.  On May 4, 2011, a federal district court in Brooklyn, New York, entered a judgment against AGAs in Buckhannon v. New York AGAs (CPLR 8600).  The court found that, in light of the AGA's actions, the state AGAs should not be required to award fees to a party that is not a prevailing party under the federal law, and that an AGAs must be a \"prevailing party\" under the state EAJA.  Further, the Court of Appeals ruled that, as set forth in its order, the Legislature's departure from the Federal EAJA was not sufficient to impose a stricter standard for demonstrating prevailing party status under the State EAJA, and incorporated into the new law only those changes that it deemed necessary to satisfy the Governor's desire to place \u201c\u2018adequate restraints on the number of fees awarded.\u2019  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced parallel criminal charges against AG Asheb Jung, who was also charged by the SEC with violating the charged"
