  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Connecticut woman who was charged with reckless manslaughter and criminally negligent operation of a motor vehicle.  According to the SEC's complaint, Evelyn Agyei left her Bridgeport home at approximately 6 a.m. on December 4, 2014 and was confronted by her son, who told her that he had driven west on Boston Avenue and hit his mother's car.  The complaint alleges that the defendant knew that the car in the still photograph was a newer model BMW X3 and that, in doing so, she had created a grave risk of death to the victim.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the jury found the defendant liable for both of these charges because he failed to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the vehicle that hit her mother's vehicle would cause the victim's death.  In its judgment, the court held that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 53a-55 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and bars her from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On May 9, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Gershfeld of the New York District Court entered a judgment ordering a permanent injunction against the defendants from violating these provisions, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $150,000 each, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $25,000.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Yasiel R. Chyung, Arthur Calvao, and Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut State Corporation Commission in this matter."
