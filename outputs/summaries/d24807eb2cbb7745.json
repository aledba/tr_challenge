  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the court's order, A.M. was placed on supervised probation in his mother and stepfather's home, and was placed in the harshest option for conduct amounting to class D felony battery with bodily injury if committed by an adult.  The court found that, in his seven years of attendance at the school, he was frequently truant and/or tardy and had multiple suspensions for fighting, \u201cexplosive rage,\u201d property destruction, e.g., throwing chairs and flipping desks, and violent acts against school personnel.  As alleged in the complaint, the court modified his placement based on insufficient information, without sufficient evidence, and without adequately explaining its reasons for doing so.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against A. M. for his role in the alleged misconduct.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson County, Indiana, alleges that the trial court abused its discretion by failing to adequately account for the defendant's continued failure to adhere to the rules of his supervised placement, disregarded his court-ordered curfew, and threatened his family when they reported him to probation officers.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and imposing a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 24, 2018.  On May 25, 2018, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order requiring the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $150,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael R. Ripps and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Wayne Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Indiana Department of Corrections, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Indiana Office of Child and Family Education and Advocacy."
