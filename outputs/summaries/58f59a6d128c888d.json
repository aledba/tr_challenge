  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in a lien case against a Pennsylvania-based company and its owner in connection with an ongoing bankruptcy.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 9.302 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"), Fishback and Surface agreed to settle the case by agreeing to pay $1.1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their respective liens on the farm. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the complaint, the defendants also agreed to pay a $1 million civil penalty, which is equal to disgorging their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and penalties, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Fishback agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay civil penalties of $1,500 each. The court also granted the defendants the right to reapply for a hearing in the future on the same matter.  On August 29, 2016, the court issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to comply with the court's order.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Fishback, Surface, and another defendant in the same case.  It also issued a cease-and-desist order against the third defendant, PNC, for violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  PNC has agreed to a settlement where it will pay $2.5 million in civil penalties and disgorge $2,500 in interest and a $500,000 civil penalty. The SEC is continuing to investigate the matter of whether or not to issue an order imposing civil penalties against PNC and Fishback.  A hearing is scheduled for September 5, 2018.
