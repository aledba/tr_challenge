The complaint alleges that MMT violated Section 432.070 of the federal securities laws by entering into a contract that prohibited MMT from directly receiving or delivering cars to the port. MMT also violated Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against MMT.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on September 19, 2017, in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, the SEC charged MMT with acting as an unregistered broker-dealer in connection with the purchase and sale of unregistered securities in the securities of a public company.  MMT agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $15,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On September 21, 2018, the United States District Court in Jackson entered a judgment ordering MMT to disgorge $10,000 in prejudgment interests and pay civil penalties of $20,000 each. The court also issued an order suspending MMT's registration with the SEC, freezing its assets, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Section 5 and ordering them to pay civil monetary penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC. The order also prohibits MMT and its affiliates from participating in any future solicitation of a penny stock, including the purchase or sale of any penny stock. In addition, the court granted MMT a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 5, ordering it to comply with a court order requiring it to provide a copy of the final judgment.  Finally, the Court granted RSSI's motion for summary judgment on September 20, 2018.  A hearing on September 24, 2018 was scheduled for"
