  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Hawai'i today entered a final judgment in favor of the Association of Apartment Owners of Hawaiian Monarch (AOAO) and Jonah Scott Kogen (Kogen) in a related action.  The court's order, which was entered on August 5, 2015, permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In its order, the court also granted the defendants the right to proceed with nonjudicial foreclosure of the AOAO's property without a power of sale.  According to the order, Kogen failed to state any relevant facts in support of his or her claims, and was barred by HRS \u00a7'514B-146 from participating in the foreclosure of a condominium property.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, imposing civil penalties, and imposing officer-and-director and penny stock bars.  Kogen also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $50,000.  On May 5, 2014, the Hawaii District Court entered a judgment against Kogen, finding him liable for violating Section 5 and ordering him to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of the Assistant Registrar of the Land Court of the State of Hawaii and the case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Hawai\u02bbi Department of Banking and Securities, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Hawai\u2018i Office of Financial Regulation.
