  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against San Francisco-based dentists Michael McNair and Joanne Keaney in a civil injunctive action brought by the District Attorney's Office.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, McNair signed a letter to the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) stating that he would not disclose his medical history and health condition to the agency. The complaint alleges that, in reality, the letter was not authorized by law and was not subject to the litigation privilege. Rather, the complaint alleges, the letters were sent to the DMV in the course of a routine examination of McNair's driving capabilities. McNair allegedly told the DMV that he had been fired in the past for his unwillingness to assist passengers in driving a school bus, and that he did not like to babysit people.  The complaint further alleges that Dr. Kim sent the letter because she was concerned that McNair had suffered a lapse of consciousness and was unable to maintain even basic functioning.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court also issued a temporary restraining order against McNair. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Kerstetter and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the San Francisco Regional Office. The litigation proceeding will be led by Ms. Kim. The case is being supervised by San Francisco District Attorney Robert A. Kasper.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17."
