  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former dentist who filed a third amended complaint alleging that he failed to timely file a written report with the court.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on May 28, 2015, Barbara S. Horlacher, a resident of Chicago, filed a second amended complaint on June 1, 2016, alleging that, in connection with her treatment of tooth No. 31, Dr. William J. Cohen, a practicing dentist in Chicago, failed to file an affidavit stating that he had consulted and reviewed the facts of the case with a licensed dentist, and that, since she was out of town, she could not file the written report.  The SEC alleges that, contrary to these representations, plaintiff filed her amended complaint with prejudice on June 2, 2016.  In its amended complaint, the court also found that plaintiff failed to provide a timely response to her second amended request for a hearing on July 13, 2015.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, plaintiff consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On September 21, 2016 the trial court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against Cohen and ordered him to pay a total of $14,500, which represents approximately $1.2 million in disgorgment and prejudgment interests, and a $1 million civil penalty.  Last week, the SEC filed an amended complaint against Cohen, charging him with violations of Section 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and seeking a permanent injunction against further violations of that provision. The SEC's amended complaint charges Cohen with violating Sections 5(a)(1) and 5(c) thereunder and with violating Rule 5 thereunder. The amended complaint also charges him with aiding and abetting Cohen's violations of Sections 5 and 5 and with failing to comply with Rule 5. The court also ordered Cohen to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000, which is approximately twice as much as the amount that he was required to pay in the first amended complaint.  Cohen has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge $1,2 million, and imposing a $20,000 penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval."
