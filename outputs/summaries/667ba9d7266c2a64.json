  "summary": "On November 19, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona entered a temporary restraining order against Phoenix Police Officer Juan Hernandez, who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, Arizona, alleges that, in violation of Section 5 of the federal securities laws, Hernandez violated the right to free and simple speech and the duty to represent the interests of the public.  According to the complaint, Hernandez's posts, which were disseminated through social media, raised the prospect of disciplinary action against him.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Hernandez violated Section 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(2)(A) of Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hernandez consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 5, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Additionally, the court issued an order suspending Hernandez from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an officer or director of a public agency for five years, ordering him to comply with the Commission's order suspending him from appearing, practicing, or appearing before the Commission as a member of any public agency.  On November 21, 2020, the SEC filed a complaint against Hernandez, charging him with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 9(a) of its Rules of Practice, and with violating Section 15(a).  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars against him from participating in or participating in any manner in the promotion, promotion, or promotion of any type of public service.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael R. Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Arizona Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Arizona Attorney General's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them advice on how to protect themselves or others from being targeted by a potential disciplinary action.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Department of Justice today announced that it would conduct an internal investigation to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to determine that there was a sufficient basis for the investigation. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit."
