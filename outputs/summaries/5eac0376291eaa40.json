  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendant in a sewer extension case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Westport, New York, alleges that, on January 8, 2014, the defendant, Summit Saugatuck, LLC, applied to the town of Westport for approval of a private sewer extension to service a proposed affordable housing development. The court found that the defendant had a ministerial duty to grant a conditional approval of the sewer extension application, and that, as a matter of policy, it had a duty to exercise its discretion in determining whether to grant or not to grant the conditional approval. The complaint further alleged that, in denying the defendant's amended application, the court improperly substituted its own discretion and judgment for that of the city's planning and zoning commission.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to consider the merits of the amended application and, instead, acted arbitrarily and abused its discretion.  In a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the pre-judgment provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering him to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 9, 2018, the Court granted the defendant a temporary restraining order and ordered a hearing in which it will determine whether to issue a judgment imposing a permanent injunction against future violations. The hearing will be conducted by R. J. Fuller and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in this matter."
