Biglari Holdings, Inc., a publicly-traded company, and its CEO, Phillip Cooley, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 23-1-27-2 of the Securities Act of 1933.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis on April 19, 2019, S.Biglari and Cooley agreed to settle the charges by consenting to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws.  The final judgments, which are subject to court approval, order disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In its order, the court also granted the SEC the right to request a temporary restraining order and to freeze the assets of the defendants.   The court's order, which was entered without prejudice to the complaint, permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the anti-fraud provisions and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J.
