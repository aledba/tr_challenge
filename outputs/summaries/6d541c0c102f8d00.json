  "summary": "On May 9, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Minnesota entered a final judgment against the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois for the Southern District of New York for the purpose of unsealing a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnesota, alleges that, on March 30, 2015, a federal agent questioned a Minnesota man who was on a watchlist for a potential terrorist attack.  According to the complaint, the agent allegedly told the man that he had information about a potential attack on his family.  As alleged, however, Mr. Wilwal was not on the watchlist at the time, and the agent simply ordered him out of the van at gunpoint.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Wilwal consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  In addition, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Wilwal from further violations of the federal securities laws, ordered him to comply with the court's order, and issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On May 10, the SEC filed an amended complaint alleging that Wilwal violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and that he violated Rule 5 thereunder by failing to show sufficient evidence to support a reasonable claim for a civil injunction against future violations.  Wilwal also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service, and to be barred from associating with any third party in connection with any action or omission arising from his detention.  Additionally, the Court granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction, which is pending final approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17 (March 30, 2013).  In a parallel action, the Department of Homeland Security today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order temporarily freezing Wilwal's assets, freezing his assets, and issuing an order requiring him to surrender his passport.  Separately, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has issued an\u00c2\u00a0investigation\u00c2\u00a0to determine whether there is sufficient evidence for a court order freezing the assets of Wilwal and his family, including his passport, to determine whether to proceed with a civil action.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted"
