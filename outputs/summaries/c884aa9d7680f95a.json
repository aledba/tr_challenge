  "summary": "On December 27, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that the defendants violated Section 8811 of the Exchange Act, which prohibits the valuation of real property for tax purposes.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to consider the value of the property when determining the fair market value of a property.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to the defendants' representations, the exemption for signs and sign structures is improper because the exemption does not apply to all of the properties that are subject to a fair market valuation.  For example, as alleged in the SEC's Complaint, a valuation of a real property should be based on the value that the property is worth on the basis of its current use, not on its valuation of its value.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's order, defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions, ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against each of the defendants.   The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 8(b)(4) and Rule 8(a) and (c) thereunder of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce, and the Pennsylvania Office of Financial Regulation."
