  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of obstructing governmental administration in the second degree.  According to the court's order, on April 5, 2014, a New York City officer conducted a routine vehicle stop on a public road in an attempt to stop a motorcyclist who was about to be stopped by the officers. The officer allegedly used a series of motions to obstruct the officer, including a motion to dismiss, that the officer had engaged in a \"permanent vehicle stop\" on April 26, 2014. The court found that the officers' actions were not authorized by the officer and that the warrant was executed within the 10-day period required by CPL 690.30 (1). The court also found that, upon examination of the officer's video recording, defendant \"did not obstruct officers by shaking his head and operating [his] vehicle backwards at a high rate of speed \"in an effort to elude the officer.  The officer then, after a brief vehicle pursuit, place[s] the defendant into custody.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges the defendant with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa of the SEC's New York Regional Office. The matter is being handled by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas and supervised by Amy S. Cotter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
