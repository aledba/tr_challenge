  "summary": "On March 20, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in a civil injunctive action filed in federal court in Farmville, Virginia.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in September 2017, Morales and Raygoza were arrested in Virginia, where they and their families lived, on charges that they were unlawfully arrested and detained without inspection or admission.  According to the complaint, Morales, who was previously incarcerated in Texas, alleged that at that time he \u201cbelieved he [too] would be imminently transferred out of Virginia by ICE.\u201d  The complaint further alleged that, at the time of their arrest, Morales had no \"recognized liberty interest\u201d to be protected by procedural due process, and that, because of the nature of their detention, they were not subject to judicial review.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Morales, Raygoz, and their father.

Separately, on March 21, 2017, a federal district court in Texas issued an order granting the SEC an emergency asset freeze and freezing the assets of the defendants and ordering them to return to their homes and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.5 million. The court also granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, which was entered without prejudice by the court on March 20. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the return of any civil penalties.  To learn more about the importance of family unity and due process in this matter, see Litigation Release No. 10-cv-17 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the San Diego Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Texas Department of Health and Human Services, the"
