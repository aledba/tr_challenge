  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against the City of Tyler for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13.2475 of the Texas Water Code.  The court entered the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Tyler, Texas, the city of Tyler and its owner, Liberty Utilities (Tall Timbers Sewer) Corporation, sought to impose a default preference for local or special laws that govern the affairs of a municipal government. The complaint alleges that, in violation of the federal law, the City was unable to obtain a certificate of convenience and public necessity that includes the area served by the municipal sewer utility. The court ruled that the city could not provide sewer service within its city limits without first obtaining a municipal utility certificate of public convenience and necessity. In addition, the court found that the municipal utility had the right to provide sewer services within its jurisdiction without first having obtained that certificate from the utility commission. In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the city. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Fort Worth Regional Office and is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Ms. Kolkhorst. The case has been supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
