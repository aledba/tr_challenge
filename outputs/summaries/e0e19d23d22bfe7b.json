  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nevada today entered a final judgment against a Washoe County Sheriff's Office officer who conducted a warrantless search of a home in January 2016. The court found that the deputy who conducted the search did not have the authority to warrant the search.  According to the court's order, Deputy Gamboa, who was supervising the search, observed a small truck in the driveway with front-end damage and smoke or steam coming from the engine compartment of the truck. The deputy allegedly entered the house and asked Robert Lastine, who answered the door, if he had authority to search the house. Lastine allegedly replied that he did not, and did not consent to a search of the home. The judge granted the deputy\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, ordered the deputy to return to the scene of the alleged crime, and issued a search warrant.  The court also issued an order suspending the search pending final approval by the court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Lastine. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Las Vegas, charges the deputy with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the deputy consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The final judgment also orders the Deputy to comply with the court order, which requires him to provide a copy of the final judgment to the SEC. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa, Chief of the Nevada Division of Criminal Investigation. The litigation will be led by Mr. Wadley and Ms. Wadhwani."
