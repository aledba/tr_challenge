  "summary": "The defendant, Anthony Mazza, was convicted in 1973 of murder in the first degree and robbery in connection with the strangling death of Peter Armata.  The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts on July 1, 1972, Robert Anderson, a convicted felon who was incarcerated for unspecified reasons at the time of trial, told the court that he met the defendant on the morning of June 30, 1972 in the South End section of Boston. The complaint alleges that the defendant gave Robert a watch, a ring, and a key to a Pontiac Grand Prix that was parked outside, and then asked Robert to help him move the body into a closet in the back hallway off the apartment.

Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future. The judgment also prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney or as a public figure. The court also ordered him to sign an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver. The receiver also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The jury deliberated for a short period of time before concluding that the receiver was not required to comply with the order. The final judgment, which is subject to court approval, orders the receiver to disgorge"
