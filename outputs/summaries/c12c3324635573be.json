  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a Marietta, Ohio-based appraiser who improperly relied on apartment comparables when valuing an assisted-living facility.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio on October 26, 2016, Zachary G. Bowyer, L.L.C., a certified appraiser, and Washington County Auditor Richard G. Racek, Jr. (collectively, \"the county\") rejected Bowyer's appraisal based on the fact that he failed to separate business value from realty value.  The complaint alleges that Bowyer failed to use the available apartment data to determine whether he was entitled to a right to receive the business income associated with a real-estate-only valuation.  Bowyer also allegedly failed to consider that the county's appraisal was based on \"ludicrous\" and \"unreasonable\" assumptions about how the facility's services would perform.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Bowyer.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Bowyer consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $2,900,000 plus prejudgment interest of $9,100, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Finally, the court granted the BTA's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits Bowyer from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any real estate, and from making any judgments regarding the valuation of a real estate-related property.  On November 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans granted Bowyer and Racek's requests for an asset freeze and an order appointing an independent receiver to determine the value of the real estate in its jurisdiction.  A hearing scheduled for November 5, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, 2017-Ohio-2574."
