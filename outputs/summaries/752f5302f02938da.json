  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was sentenced to 30 years in prison for armed robbery, 3 years for resisting a peace officer, and 5 years for threatening a public official.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that defendant, Lashkmibhargava Ravi, was arrested on October 3, 2015, while working at the Bloomington Food Mart convenience store. Rizzi allegedly told the clerk that defendant had a gun and demanded the money in the cash register. The clerk allegedly refused to give the clerk the money. The complaint further alleges that the clerk confronted defendant about the alleged threat of harm. The court found that defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of restitution requested in the PSI. The SEC also charged defendant with violating the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of the federal securities laws. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, imposes a five-year prison sentence, and imposes a $25,000 civil penalty. The final judgment also prohibits defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, other than for his own personal use. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against Ravi. The case was investigated by the Chicago Regional Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy S. Cotter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Illinois Department of Justice, the Chicago Police Department, the FBI's Criminal Investigations Division, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division and the Illinois State Attorney General's Office."
