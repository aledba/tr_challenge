  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment ordering the New York City Water Board to issue a 2.1% increase to water and wastewater charges for the city's water supply and wastewater system.  According to the court's order, filed on April 8, 2016, the Water Board issued a resolution on May 20, 2016 that required it to raise the water and sewer rates for the first time since 1984.  The resolution also required that the water board issue a $183.00 bill credit to certain class of residential property owners in order to offset the water bills owed by the city.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this was not an authorization to issue the bill credit, and instead was an arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable delay in issuing the credit.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the city did not authorize the issuance of the credit, as required by the federal law, and that the City's decision to forego a $122 million rental payment from the water district in FY 2016 resulted in a revenue shortfall of $76 million.

Additionally, the court entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering the defendants to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $167,000.  Finally, the Court entered a preliminary injunction against the Defendants from issuing any additional water or sewer credit, in violation of the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and the books and records provision of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and ordering the Defendants to pay a $192,500 civil penalty.  On May 24, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court in Manhattan, alleging that the defendants violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20 thereunder. The complaint also alleged that the Defendants violated Section 4 of the Financing Agreement and Rules 5a-1 and 5a2-3 thereunder by failing to comply with the Commission's requests for a temporary asset freeze and with"
