  "summary": "On May 21, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against John Moriarty, a San Francisco resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, charges Moriarty with violations of the anti-SLAPP provisions of the federal securities laws.  In its complaint, Moriarty alleges that, in June 2011, he learned that the landlords had chosen to permanently retain possession of the subject premises and thereafter refused to return possession to him in violation of the tenants' rights.  Moriarty's complaint also alleges that in July 2011, the defendants filed an emergency detainer action against him, which resulted in the eviction of some of the tenant's units.  According to the complaint, after Moriarty complained about the landlord's actions, he voluntarily vacated the premises, knowing that he would lose the right to return the property to the tenant.  As alleged in the complaint:    The complaint alleges that Moriarty violated his duty of due care to the tenants by failing to state just cause for the eviction or offer any relocation benefits as required by the federal law.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Moriarty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering Moriarty to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Finally, the court has issued an order suspending Moriarty from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and Carol S. Cotter of the San Francisco Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by John Rymas. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Office of the Director of the Market Abuse Unit and the Financial Instruments Regulatory Surveillance Authority."
