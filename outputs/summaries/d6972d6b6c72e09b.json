  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against a motor vehicle operator accused of driving while intoxicated.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that, on April 4, 2016, the Southington Police Department received a call from an officer who observed the operator of the vehicle acting in an increasingly belligerent manner after being informed that the operator had suffered a physical injury. The complaint alleges that the officer took the officer's blood sample and used it to determine whether the operator required treatment or observation at a hospital. According to the complaint, the officer followed instructions from the officer to remove the officer from the vehicle and put him in the back of an ambulance, whereupon he began acting in a \"borderline\" number. The officer then took the plaintiff down to the ground, which resulted in a small cut to the plaintiff's chin and a small dent to the cruiser's roof. The SEC alleges that this conduct was consistent with the requirements of the federal securities laws, and the officer was informed by the officer that he had probable cause to arrest the defendant for operating a motor motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drug or both.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that Officer Lair assisted the plaintiff so that he would not fall again and assisted him with his medical examination.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 14-227a of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 14227b (j) or 14-228b (k) (2017). The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Connecticut State Police, the State Attorney General's Office, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations Division and the Connecticut Office of Inspector General's Retail Strategy Task Force."
