  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Social Security Administration's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against Glacken.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City on June 21, 2017, Glackenhall, a self-described \"tough guy,\" suffered from type II diabetes, hypertension, chest pain from coronary heart disease, high cholesterol and hereditary hemochromatosis (the excessive buildup of iron in the body).  The complaint alleges that, in addition to his physical and mental impairments, he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and was previously diagnosed with major depressive disorder and PTSD.  The SEC's order, which is subject to court approval, orders Glackhall to comply with the court's order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced criminal charges against him.  On June 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in Manhattan, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $1,000,000 and a $100,000 bar from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kelly L.
