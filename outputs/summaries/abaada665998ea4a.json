  "summary": "On August 13, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Monster Energy Company (Monster) and its co-defendant, Richard Fournier, for breaching the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that, by signing the settlement agreement under the words, \"Approved as to form and content,\" Monster violated the federal securities laws by failing to show a probability of prevailing on its cause of action for breach of contract.  According to the complaint, the defendants also failed to show that they were bound by the agreement by any means.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants were not required to sign the agreement as required by the federal law.  Monster has agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Monster from violating the federal, state, and local securities laws, and orders it to pay $437,500 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the settlement amount.  On August 16, 2019, the court granted Monster's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the defendants to comply with the court's order.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
