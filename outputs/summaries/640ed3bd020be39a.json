  "summary": "The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment finding that Austin G. Heywood Jr., a real estate agent, committed fraud by concealing a bona fide purchase offer from his client so that he could force a short sale of the property to his own investment group (the 2006 transaction).  According to the SEC's complaint, in 2006, Heywood acted as an unregistered broker for a client who was delinquent on her mortgage payments and had been unsuccessful in finding a buyer for her home. The complaint alleges that Heywood, who was represented by counsel, told the client that he knew of a group of short-sale investors who were interested in purchasing her home, but he did not disclose that the division was conducting an investigation into the 2006 transaction.  The complaint further alleges that the Division's denial of Heywood\u2019s license was untimely and should be barred by the doctrine of laches, which requires a court to determine whether a defendant is entitled to a preclusive effect of a judgment on the merits of a case.  In addition, the SEC alleges that, in 2014, the bankruptcy court granted Heywood a temporary restraining order preventing him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court granted the restraining order against Heywood. The court also denied Heywood the right to reapply for his real estate license in 2014.  On March 9, 2011, the court issued an order suspending Heywood from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any real estate investment property. The order also prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Mascianica and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Amy C. Welshhans."
