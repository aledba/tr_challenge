  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a former chief executive officer of a South Korean company for defrauding municipal customers.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Heon Seok Lee, the former CEO of KTurbo Inc., lied about his company\u2019s purchase of turbo blowers from South Korea, and failed to disclose to his customers that his company manufactured and sold the turbine blowers in the United States.  According to the complaint, Lee falsely represented to his sales representatives that K Turbo was made in the U.K. and that it was not subject to the Buy American provision of the federal securities laws.  In fact, the complaint alleges that Lee knew the company did not manufacture and sell the turbo blower, and instead used forged documents to cover up the scheme.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Lee agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000.  Lee also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $10,000, and to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $100,000 for a total of $192,768, respectively.  On March 28, 2018, the court granted Lee a temporary restraining order and ordered him to surrender his passport and return to South Korea.  To learn more about wire fraud, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 24, 2019).  In a parallel action, the United Kingdom Attorney General's Office today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting Lee's alleged scheme to defraud municipal customers by issuing false and misleading statements about the purchase and sale of turbine blades.  A parallel criminal proceeding is pending against Lee, who has pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and sentenced to 12 months and 10 days, respectively, in a parallel criminal case.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Lee on March 26, 2019, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Lee from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, or promotion of any type of turbine blower.  It also obtained an order suspending Lee from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to comply with the court order.  Finally, on March 27, 2018 Lee pleaded guilty"
