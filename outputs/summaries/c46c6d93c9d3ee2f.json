  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the siblings in an attorney-fee case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on November 9, 2017, Robert T. Meadows III and R. Faith Perdue, attorneys with the law firm of Capell & Howard, P.C., filed a motion for a hearing to determine the appropriate amount of attorney fees to be awarded to the siblings.  According to the complaint, Meadows and Perdue raised the issue of whether the trial court had jurisdiction to determine whether to award an attorney fee based on the nature and value of the attorney's services, and that, as required by the settlement agreement, the court could not impose a lien upon the attorney.

Additionally, the judgment requires Meadows to file an independent action to collect attorney fees, which he has already agreed to do.  Without admitting to the Commission's findings, Meadows has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  He has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay an officer and director bar in the same capacity as he or she is entitled to.  On May 24, 2019, the Court granted the request for a temporary restraining order against Meadows, ordering him to comply with the court's order, and appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, John V.
