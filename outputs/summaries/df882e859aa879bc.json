  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Bastrop, Louisiana man for his role in a 2016 armed robbery.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that on August 4, 2016, three young men approached elderly Hubert Williams, ordered him to the ground at gunpoint and robbed him of his debit card and his cell phone.  According to the complaint, Williams told the men that he had been robbed by three young black men in the area of Van and Pleasant Streets in Bastrop and told them he needed a ride home.  Williams allegedly told them that he was armed during the robbery and that they had pointed a shotgun at the victim.  As alleged, Williams allegedly replied to the men's questions about the severity of the crime and the pattern of violence exhibited by this young man.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New Orleans today announced that it filed a criminal case against Williams, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Williams consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and bars him from participating in any future criminal proceeding.  On August 10, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered a final order permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws and ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The court also ordered Williams to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, prejudgment interest of $2,038.81, and a $1 million civil penalty for a total of $192,768.71.  A hearing on August 11, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Police Department, the Bastrop Police Department and the New York Police Department. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
