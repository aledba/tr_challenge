  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its role in the Flint Water Crisis.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Flint, Michigan, alleges that the EPA violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the agency failed to adequately inform Flint residents of the risks posed by lead-contaminated drinking water.  According to the complaint, the EPA's failure to respond to Flint residents' complaints was consistent with the agency's prior actions in this matter.  For example, the complaint alleges that, in the first half of 2015, Flint's water system was highly corrosive and had a significant risk of lead leaching out of the pipes and into residents' homes.  In addition, as the complaint further alleges, the federal government failed to inform Flint's residents that it had implemented a \"boil water safety rule\" that required the city to use optimal corrosion control treatment upon switching water sources.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the agency.   The complaint charges the EPA with violating Sections 1414 and 1431 of the federal securities laws, and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Diskin and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and the Michigan Secretary of State's Office."
