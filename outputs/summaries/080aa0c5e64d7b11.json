  "summary": "On March 29, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma entered final judgment against Miller on his motion for a temporary restraining order (COA) against him.  The court found that Miller violated the antiterrorism and effective death penalty provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to show that he was entitled to a COA based on material, non-capital claims.  In its order denying Miller\u2019s motion, the court also found that the OCCA violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Miller had failed to show his entitlement to a reasonable determination of the facts.  According to the order, Miller filed a habeas petition in federal district court in Oklahoma in March 2019, alleging that the Oklahoma trial court improperly declined to instruct the jury concerning this lesser-included offense.  Miller also alleges that the court improperly suborned and presented perjured testimony from Sundeep Patel, a hotel desk clerk, and Phyllis Miller, a prison desk clerk.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Miller consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On May 2, 2020, the Oklahoma court issued an order granting Miller the right to return to the United States to serve a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for the Thurman murder and ordered that the sentence be served consecutively to the life sentence for the Bowles murder.  At the time of his sentencing, Miller was serving a prison sentence of 157 years plus 157 years' imprisonment at the time he filed his petition.  He was previously sentenced to life without parole in 1999 for the murders of Bowles and Thurman, and the sentence he received in 2008 for the same crime was later reversed and sent to the receiving state pursuant to a detainer and a request for custody.  As a result of this finding, Miller has not been able to present a valid defense of his convictions and has been barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The SEC's complaint charges Miller with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(b)(5) of\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act of 1940 and Rule\u00c2\u00a010b2(b).  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
