  "summary": "On July 1, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment in favor of transfer to Kane County, Illinois.  The court held that, as a matter of fact, the defendant's business dealings in Kane County did not favor transfer.  According to the court's order, William Hale, as administrator of the estate of Jordan Hale, was driving a commercial truck for Welch Bros. when he collided with a motorcycle.  As alleged in the order, the court found that the defendant had a \"palpable interest\" in the litigation arising out of the accident, and that he had failed to establish the facts strongly favored transfer to Chicago County.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against the defendant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, charges that David O. Odman violated the federal securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Odman consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  He also agreed to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, and to be restrained from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  On July 2, 2018, the Court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against him from appearing or practicing before the court as a representative of a broker or dealer in a settled case.  To learn more about the Illinois attorney general's orders, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (March 24, 2018).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
