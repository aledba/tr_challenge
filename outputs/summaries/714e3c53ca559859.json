  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against Minnesota Power, Inc., a Minnesota-based power company, and its Wisconsin affiliate, South Shore Energy LLC, for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnesota, alleges that Minnesota Power violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the Commission violated the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of its Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint further alleges that, in violation of the Commission's order, Minnesota Power failed to demonstrate a need for the affiliated-interest agreements and failed to adequately consider the potential environmental impact of the power plant construction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Minnesota and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced parallel criminal charges against the defendants.  Minnesota Power and South Shore have agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the charged provisions. The Commission also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties imposed by the court. The settlement is subject to court approval. The complaint also names Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, Union of Concerned Scientists, and Sierra Club as relief defendants. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Minnesota Department of Commerce in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Commission issued an order requiring Minnesota Power to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a proposed power plant in Wisconsin.  According to the Commission\u2019s order, the EIS should be prepared by the responsible governmental unit (RGU) before it determines whether to order an EAW for a power plant outside of Minnesota.  For further information, see Investor Alert:\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange Advisers (OIEA) and \"Investors in Environmental Quality\" (EQQ).  The Commission acknowledges the importance of the federal government's involvement in the permitting process for power plants, but the Commission acknowledges that it has not taken a hard look at the problems involved and that it is not obligated to approve or reject certain kinds of commercial transactions.&nbsp; The Commission's Order requires the Commission to determine whether a governmental action is \"reasonable and consistent with the public interest\" before making a determination"
