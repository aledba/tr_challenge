  "summary": "On October 29, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil action brought by New York State District Court against them for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that defendants violated the mandatory consent to jurisdiction provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of federal law.  According to the complaint, defendants were tricked into signing a clause that required them to submit to jurisdiction in New York.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the clause requires that defendants submit to the jurisdiction of the federal district court for the purpose of determining whether a complaint should be filed in the United States.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On November 6, 2016, the court granted a motion for a temporary restraining order against the defendants from violating these provisions, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for October 26, 2017.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17.   The complaint charges defendants with violating Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 15b2-3 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against each defendant.  To learn more about penny stock, see Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0OnInvestor.gov\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0the Market Abuse Unit.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed an emergency action on October 24, 2017 against a Texas-based company accused of defrauding investors in an oil and gas drilling project.  This case was investigated by David McGowan of the SEC Enforcement Division's Fort Worth Regional Office, and the case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas State Attorney General's Office."
