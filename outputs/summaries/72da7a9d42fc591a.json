  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against the father of an Ohio-based child custody case.  The court found that the father violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  According to the court's order, the father was not permitted to participate in the child custody proceeding because he was prohibited by a federal court from participating in child custody proceedings.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against him.  As alleged in the complaint, the court granted the father's request for a temporary restraining order and a right to return the child to his mother.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Ohio, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws, imposes a $25,000 civil penalty on the father, and requires him to comply with a court order requiring him to show cause and effect in a court proceeding. The court also ordered the father to pay a $10,000 officer-director penalty.  On May 9, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan entered a judgment against him, ordering him to disgorge $2,078, which he did not pay, and imposing a $20,000 penalty. The judgment also ordered that he be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and ordered to pay civil penalties of up to $100,000.  A hearing for the father is scheduled for April 5, 2018. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Department of Health and Human Services in this matter.
