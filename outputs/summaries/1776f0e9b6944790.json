  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a securities fraud case, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that James Q. Whitaker opened a brokerage account with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (Merrill Lynch), a brokerage firm, prior to his marriage. The complaint alleges that shortly after opening the account, a hacker sent several unauthorized e-mails purporting to be from plaintiffs.  According to the complaint, the hacker could send wire transfer requests to defendant and intercept defendant\u2019s e-mail replies.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Whitaker.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Whitaker consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $374,960, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $2,065. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On July 1, 2019, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Whitaker to comply with the court order. The court also issued an order suspending Whitaker from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Banking, and the Illinois Office of Financial Regulation in this matter."
