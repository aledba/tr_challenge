  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and his agency, Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, alleges that Paxton violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Paxton has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating these provisions and orders him to comply with the court's order.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Paxton.  According to the complaint, Paxton was arrested in 2001 for possession of a controlled substance and subsequently sentenced to prison for 10 years. Paxton agreed to be appointed managing conservator of the children, and the Department agreed to conduct a home study of Luz Maria Raez, the father's aunt. The court granted Paxton's request for a temporary restraining order and appointed a permanent conservator, which is required by the federal securities laws. The complaint also alleges Paxton failed to adequately disclose to the court that he had been incarcerated for drug-related offenses and failed to sign the rule 11 agreement when he was incarcerated.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC complaint, the Department of Justice and Paxton consented to a judgment permanently enjoining Paxton from violating the above-mentioned provisions and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On June 1, 2017, the court entered a judgment ordering Paxton to consent to the appointment of a temporary conservator under Section 161.001(b)(1)(Q) and for a second and third time, the Court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction. The final judgment, which was entered by Paxton on September 18, 2018, orders Paxton not to violate the charged provisions of the Texas Family Code and for him to be permanently enjoined from violating those provisions. The Court also ordered Paxton liable for any civil penalties that may be imposed upon Paxton or Paxton in the future by the court upon motion of the court.   The court also ordered the Department to provide a copy of the final judgment to Paxton, agreeing to the issuance of a court order requiring a court to hold a hearing concerning the termination of parental rights. The hearing was held on September 12, 2016, and a hearing was scheduled for October 13, 2016. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas State Attorney"
