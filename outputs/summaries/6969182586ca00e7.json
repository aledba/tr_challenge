  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Commerzbank AG, and its affiliated special purpose vehicle for breaching their duty to monitor, detect, and prevent any material breach of the trust's obligations under the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, from at least 2012 through at least 2016, the Trustees violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the trustees failed to provide notice of any violations of these provisions, and instead engaged in a series of boiler-room schemes to overcharge borrowers, overcharge them, and delay foreclosure proceedings.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the trustees allegedly failed to inform the servicer and other deal parties that they had breached their duties in connection with certain of the trusts.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the trustee's duty to detect and prevent a potential event of default arises when a material breach occurs, such as when a borrower defaulted on a loan, or when a default occurs.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint and the Court's order, the trustees consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requires them to provide a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Philadelphia Regional Office by John Rymas of the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and FINRA's Office of Inspector General.
