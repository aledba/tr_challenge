  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against a former chief operating officer of a credit card issuer for his role in a company that was going through a significant restructuring.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Mark Belfiore, who was the company's COO at the time of the reorganization, misappropriated and misused confidential information about the company and its compensation policies to justify his termination.  According to the complaint, in 2011, after learning that the company was going to restructure and restructure its compensation policy, he allegedly called a lower-level employee into his office and asked her to \"help me out.\"  The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the company terminated a COO who had been hired as COO in 2008, and hired three new COOs in 2011 and 2012.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC charged the former COO with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the former CEO agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $42,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  He also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar, with the right to reapply after five years, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $10,000 civil penalty.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2011, the court entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the former chief executive officer and appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver's operations, and ordering the receiver to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver.  After a six-day evidentiary hearing, the hearing examiner concluded that the receiver had failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case for the employee's termination. The SEC also issued an order suspending the receiver and appointing an independent receiver to monitor the receiver for any violations of the anti-discrimination provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d).  The receiver has agreed to the appointment of a receiver under the supervision of a hearing examiner, and the receiver will determine the amount of compensation to be paid based on the receiver"
