  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against a former research scientist who allegedly misappropriated trade secrets from Lasen, Inc. and its subsidiary, Lasen ALPIS, LLC (collectively, \u201cLasen\u201d), arising out of their lawsuit against him for breach of contract, breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, misappropriation of trade secrets, and for injunctive relief.  According to the SEC's order, filed in federal district court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Tadjikov agreed to a five-year injunction prohibiting him from disseminating or disclosing any of Lasen's trade secrets to a third party, and to pay $170,000 in disgorgement and $100,000 for the amount of his salary.  The SEC's complaint, filed on April 19, 2014, charges Tadjikaov with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgements of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Tjikov consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and orders him to return any source code he has, or that he has created and assigned to Lasen in accordance with their employment agreement, to the extent that Lasen requires him to do so for a five year period that expires in April 2014.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico announced criminal charges against Tjikaov.  On April 20, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a penny stock bar.  Among other things, the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, as well as an order requiring Lasen to provide a copy of the source code for its products and services.  A hearing on May 24, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 12-318(A)(4).  In its order, the Court also issued an order suspending Tadjikeov's employment with Lasen and ordering him to provide Lasen with an accounting of all of the alleged misappropriations in the company's books, records, and financial statements that he acquired while employed as a research scientist.  Lasen has agreed to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining it from violating Section 5"
