  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against Fernanda Guzman, a California resident who was diagnosed with depression and prescribed Zoloft.  The court found that Guzman had a history of depression and had difficulty functioning as a person.  According to the court's order, Guzman was evaluated by a psychiatrist in 2008 and diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PMSD) in 2012. The court ruled that the psychiatrist's opinion was \"well-supported\" and \"supported\" by evidence, and that she could easily recover from her depression.  However, the court also found that Dr. Esposito's opinion did not support Guzman's capacity to work with substantial evidence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Guzman.  Guzman has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the judge has also ordered Guzman to pay a $25,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom's Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the U.K.'s Office of Health and Human Services today announced that it has instituted an Office of Inspector General examination of mental health professionals. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Compliance and Assessments and Inspections, and the case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Ghanim."
