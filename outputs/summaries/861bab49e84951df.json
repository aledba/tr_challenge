  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Jeffrey Charles Zander, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 68 months in prison and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $176,698.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Zander violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, in 2005 and 2007, Zander was convicted of all counts in the Superseding Indictment, which included two counts each of mail and wire fraud, one count of money laundering, and three counts of willful failure to file federal tax returns.  Zander pleaded guilty to all of these charges in 2008 and received a total of $192,698 in restitution.  In his second sentencing hearing, the court found that the Tribe was entitled to restitution for losses caused by Zander\u2019s fraudulent scheme.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Mr. Zander consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $12,000 civil penalty, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The court also granted the Tribe a temporary restraining order and ordered Zander to pay $11,698, the difference between the $165,000 in BIA grant monies it received and what it paid to the Tribe for his personal benefit.  On June 16, 2014, a federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, granted Zander's request for a preliminary injunction, ordered him to comply with the court's order, and issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the court as a \"victim.\"  The order also prohibits Zander from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock, including securities in the securities industry, and prohibits him from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
