  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered final judgments in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to adequately disclose to the SEC that they had engaged in an investigation that uncovered potential violations of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in May 2013, NISD terminated Adams Hill Elementary School principal and assistant principal, Brian Woods, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The complaint further alleges that on June 20, 2013, Wernli and Powers called the Texas Education Agency (TEA) to inform them that J.B. had a reading disability and was therefore entitled to an oral administration accommodation for the upcoming STAAR test. The TEA later denied their requests for an asset freeze and ordered the district court to determine whether or not the defendants were liable for First Amendment retaliation based on the findings of the state hearing examiner and the reasons that the school board put forth for the termination.  On October 29, 2014, the Texas Attorney General's Office filed a complaint in federal district court against Woods, charging him with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  To settle the SEC's case, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, and ordered Woods to pay a civil monetary penalty of $1,500. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for November 20, 2018, for which the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Education in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 549 (5th Cir. 2010)."
