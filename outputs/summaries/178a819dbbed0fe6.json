  "summary": "On May 22, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri entered a final judgment against defendant Michael W. Movant, Jr., who pled guilty to two felony resisting arrest charges and was subsequently sentenced to seven years in prison.  The court found that Movant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Warren County, Missouri, Movant was charged in April 2015 with two counts of resisting a lawful stop, in violation of Section 15BB-CR00763-01, and in May 2016, the court sentenced Movant to a seven-year prison term.  Movant pled guilty in August 2016 and was sentenced to one year in the county jail.  In a parallel action, on August 2, 2016, a federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, entered a judgment against Movant that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of seven years and a $1,000,000 civil penalty.  On October 13, 2015, the trial court found Movant liable for violating the securities laws by failing to provide sufficient evidence to determine whether he was eligible for post-conviction relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the Court granted the Court's Order for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and a temporary restraining order (STO) from further violations of Section 217.362. The Court also granted Movant's motion for a preliminary injunction, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including in the purchase, sale, or purchase of a security deposit. The court granted the court's order for a temporary restraining order, a temporary injunction, and an officer-and-officer bar, and a conduct-based injunction. The order also prohibits Movant from associating with any third party, including law enforcement, and from using the internet to disseminate or sell any information concerning the status of a pending criminal case.  Additionally, the order requires the defendant to show that he understood the nature of the charges and that he was entitled to a penalty of five years imprisonment and/or a fine not to exceed $5,000.  It also requires that the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions, ordering him to comply with the terms of his prior convictions, and requiring him to submit to a court-ordered conduct-"
