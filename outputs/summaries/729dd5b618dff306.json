  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Family Rehabilitation, Inc., a Texas-based healthcare services provider, on consent for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, Family Rehab, which provides home healthcare services to patients in Texas, was assessed for about $7.6 million in overpayments by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2016. The complaint alleges that the overpayment was caused by documentary deficiencies related to the initial home health certification, and that Family Rehab had received $7,885,803.23 in excess reimbursements.  The complaint also alleges that, unlike the Eldridge or Bowen plaintiffs, Family rehab sought a temporary restraining order and an order to halt the recoupment until it received an ALJ hearing. The court's order, which was entered on consent, prohibits Family Rehab from violating the federal securities laws and requires it to submit a written statement of law and fact to the court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Family Rehab also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of its revenue lost in the earlier administrative proceedings. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1132.  Separately, the Department of Health and Human Services today announced that it has obtained a court order requiring it to consider the merits of Family Rehab's claims for a hearing before a federal district court. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Wolcott. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Insurance, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
