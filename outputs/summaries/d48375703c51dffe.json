  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment against Uber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber\u201d) and its driver, Jaswinder Singh, in an action brought by New Jersey residents alleging that Uber misclassified them as independent contractors as opposed to employees, and that the residual clause of \u00a7 1 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) did not apply to transportation workers engaged in interstate commerce.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Monmouth County, New Jersey, Singh alleged that, in violation of the federal securities laws, Uber improperly classified him as an independent contractor when, in fact, he was not engaged in the transportation of goods.  The complaint further alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, Singh was not bound by the arbitration provision of the FAA because, at the time of the amendment, he had an agreement with Uber.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Singh failed to meet its burden to show that he was a constitutional member of the class of workers to which he belonged.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Uber consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of any monetary penalty imposed by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 539 (January 24, 2019).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the New Jersey Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
