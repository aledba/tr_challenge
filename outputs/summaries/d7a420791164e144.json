  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Lyle B. Greenway, Jr., a California resident who sought to end his marriage to Joann B.Greenway.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orange County, California, alleges that Lyle Greenway agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $20,000.  According to the complaint, Lyle also agreed to participate in the dissolution of a marriage by signing and certifying that he had the capacity to make a reasoned decision about ending the marriage.  In addition, the complaint alleges Lyle agreed to be required to show cause and effect in a court proceeding to determine whether to proceed with a dissolution proceeding based on his mental capacity.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the court improperly relied on the testimony of a clinical neuropsychologist, a licensed attorney, and a certified elder law attorney to determine the appropriate level of mental capacity required for a dissolution.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC complaint, the defendants agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $10,000 each, and imposing a $50,000 civil penalty against each of them.  On June 24, 2011, the Honorable Judge Thomas R. Murphy granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Lyle to comply with the court's order.  After a hearing on June 26, 2010, Judge Murphy issued an order granting the defendants the right to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest in the matter.  Judge Murphy also granted the parties' motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering Lyle's release from the institution of default, ordering him to sign a written consent judgment, and appointing a conservator of his own.  A hearing on July 11, 2011 was scheduled for 10:30 a.m. for Lyle and his wife, who were both present at the time of the judgment.  During the hearing, the judge reviewed the evidence presented by the three health care professionals, including a clinical trial attorney, a registered representative, a certified public accountant, and an attorney.  He also reviewed the medical records and testimony of his wife.  Finally, he reviewed the financial records and certifications provided by the four health professionals.   The court found that, while Lyle had severe dementia, he was not capable of making a reasoned judgment about ending his marriage."
