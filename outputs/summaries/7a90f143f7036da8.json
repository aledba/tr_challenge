  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Kele Young, the owner and operator of the Magic Jungle Wildlife Preserve, a wildlife sanctuary located in Lucerne Valley, on consent.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Riverside County, California, alleges that Young violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Young, as an individual, operated the park and raised the issue of whether the Department of Fish and Game could waive the inspection fees without violating the federal securities laws.  Young's complaint alleges that the Department did not have the authority to waive the fees and instead relied on Exotic Feline, which she claimed represented that all of the fees should be waived.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Young consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating these provisions, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $573.37, which is equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Young.  On June 18, 2015, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Young and ordered her to comply with the court's order, ordering her to surrender her passport and other documents, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty. The court also ordered Young to pay an $8,500 civil penalty, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the court.   The court's action against Young is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Ms. Casinger. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Secretary of State's Office, and the California Attorney General's Office."
