  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment in favor of the Juveniles' request for summary judgment in a civil injunctive action brought by them.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on March 19, 2015, the Idaho Department of Juvenile Corrections (IDJC) and its employees violated the antifraud provisions of Section 6-1701 of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that the IDJC, Lieteau, and McCormick failed to timely file a notice of tort claims against the defendants.  In addition, the complaint alleged that the defendants committed lewd and lascivious acts upon the defendants, which gave rise to liability for their actions under the ITCA, and that IDJC was vicariously liable for the actions of its employees under section 5-218(1).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against one of the defendants in connection with the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On March 24, 2016, the SEC filed an amended complaint in which it found that the IdJC and its employee, Julie McCormick, had violated the notice requirements of the Idaho Tort Claims Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the amended complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the provisions of the law and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Idaho Attorney General's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
