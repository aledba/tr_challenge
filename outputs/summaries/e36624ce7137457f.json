  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Robert L. Klein, a market research and consulting expert who has been charged with misleading investors in the Episcopal Church of the United States.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charleston, South Carolina, alleges that, from at least 2012 through at least 2017, Klein conducted a survey on behalf of The Episcopal Church, which he used to assess the genericness of its mark \"The Episcopal Church\" and \"Protestant Episcopal Church.\"  According to the complaint, the survey, which was conducted by Hal Poret, was conducted in the name of a specific religious organization, not a specific denomination, and did not include any mention of any affiliation with a particular religious organization.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the survey failed to detect that certain of the words \"Episcopal\" were used in the survey.  For example, as alleged, only 0.9% of the respondents believed that the control cell of the Episcopal church was affiliated with a specific organization, and only 4% of those who responded agreed that it was.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Klein consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mark J. Lawrence. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Office of the Secretary of State."
