(\"Gilead\"), Idenix Pharmaceuticals, LLC (\"Idenix\"), and its co-defendant, Idenaix Pharm. LLC (\"GGI\"), for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's order, Gileada's claims were based on the fact that it was researching and developing drugs for the treatment of the hepatitis C virus, and that it had developed a proprietary technology that enabled it to detect and detect the presence of 2'-methyl-up nucleosides that could be effective against HCV.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Delaware, alleges that Gileade violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act by failing to provide sufficient guidance or working examples to determine whether or not a specific set of 2-methyl-ups was effective.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, GILD has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins GILD from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Exchange Act, and orders GILD to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  GILD's settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against GILD.  On February 17, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in New York, charging GILD with violating Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, and with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"), and with aiding and abetting GILD&rsquo;s violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 13a-3 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties.
