  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Cronic and Duvall Ford in a civil action brought by the two former officers of K&J Co., Inc., alleging that they engaged in a series of fraudulent vehicle transactions with K &J, including the purported sale of an Audi.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Cronic, on behalf of K & J, claimed that he and his son, Jeffrey H. Ford, convinced Bundy to enter into a business venture, incorporate K& J in connection with that venture, and provide her the use of a luxury vehicle\u2014an Audi that Bundy then purportedly sold, without authorization, to a third party.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the third party did not own the Audi and instead initiated proceedings to foreclose upon and sell it to Cronic.  The complaint further alleges that Cronic knew that the Audi had been left with Duvalls Ford for repairs and subsequently abandoned by its owners, and that he had told Bundy that he should keep it.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in a parallel action, the trial court expressly declined to set aside the foreclosure order on the Audi because it lacked jurisdiction over the matter.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $31,637.13 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038.71, a civil penalty of $100,000, and a penny stock bar.  Cronic also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer and sale of any automobile, automobile, or financial instrument, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office.

Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Georgia. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
