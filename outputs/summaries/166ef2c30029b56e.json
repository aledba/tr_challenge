  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against Mark Birdow, a former resident of a Hapeville apartment complex, ordering him to pay over $1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Birdow violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Birdow consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  Birdow also agreed to be barred from appearing before the court as an expert witness.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Atlanta today announced criminal charges against Birdow.  On August 28, 2010, two teenagers found her dead and decomposing body wrapped in a blanket and lying under a blue plastic container across the street from the apartment complex where Birdow resided.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, after Birdow and Woods went to the police station, the officers conducted a search warrant for his former apartment and located large amounts of blood in various places in the apartment as well as a bloodstain on the exterior door. The officers also questioned Birdow about the nature of the wounds, and Birdow admitted to having injured his hand by \"fooling with a bicycle\" and that he had injured his hands by cutting some meat with a chainsaw a month earlier.  At the hearing on the motion for new trial, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Birdow to return to the building where he had been previously incarcerated. The court also granted the court's request to bar Birdow from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a trial attorney.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC in the complaint filed in the case, the defendants agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the appointment of a new trial judge. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A separate administrative proceeding is pending.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 24-6-650 (January 24, 2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Atlanta Division of Criminal Investigations, and Trial Counsel Robert C. Hannan.  An SEC examination that led to the examination of Birdow's injuries was conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Georgia State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U."
