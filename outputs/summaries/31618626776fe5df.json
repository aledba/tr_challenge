  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment against defendant Lucio P. Munoz, Jr., who was convicted of two counts of attempted murder and one count of aiding and abetting a third defendant's attempted murder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on December 30, 2016, Munoz knocked on Trudy Ziegler\u2019s door and told her that he had been raped that morning by a tenant of the same apartment complex where they all lived.  According to the complaint, the victim was asleep on the bed when she was attacked, and Munoz told the woman that he was going to get the death penalty.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, the woman did not know why they had called the police, and that she did not want to make a police report.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Munoz.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Munoz also agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any federal securities law order.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of the Chief Trial Counsel and is being supervised by Marc Blau.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Nebraska Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Nebraska State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
