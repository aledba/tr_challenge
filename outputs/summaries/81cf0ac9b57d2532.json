  "summary": "On January 23, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey entered a final judgment in favor of an indigent parent or guardian in a child abuse and neglect case.  The court held that the right to counsel to indigent parents or guardians is a fundamental constitutional right.  In its final judgment, the court found that, as a matter of principle, a parent and guardian with a history of child abuse or neglect should be entitled to counsel when confronted with a finding of child neglect or neglect.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Newark, N.J., Lola was not trained to deal with the issues raised by the court, and she had no expert of her own to refute the Division's considerable presentation of the facts.  As a result, Lola's access to counsel was limited.  Lola also was unable to adequately cross-examine witnesses or elicit testimony that might have been helpful to her.  On January 24, 2020, the Court granted the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order against Lola and ordered her to return to New Jersey to be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the SEC consented to the entry of an order suspending Lola from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  A hearing scheduled for June 19, 2020 was scheduled for Lola to present her case before the court for a hearing on the merits of her case, which was conducted in the Division of Child Protection and Permanency's Office of Advocacy and Advocacy.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (2014).  The SEC's complaint charges Lola with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against her. The complaint also seeks an order requiring her to surrender her passport, pay a civil penalty, and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the New Jersey Office of Public Education, with assistance from Eric R. Werner of the Office of Inspector General, and was supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the SEC Enforcement Division's New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice. The litigation was led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the FBI."
