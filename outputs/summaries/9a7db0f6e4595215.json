  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against defendant Alexander Jaeger, who was charged with violating the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Columbia, from 1982 to 2016, defendants were required to submit to a blood test using BAC limits.  In addition, the complaint alleges that when a driver is unconscious and unable to drive, a warrantless blood draw is required to determine whether a driver has consented to a BAC test without a warrant.  For example, in Schmerber, a driver who had gotten into a car accident that gave police other pressing duties, they may have asked a hospital staff to draw a blood sample to measure the driver's BAC without offending the Fourth Amendment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Jaeger agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri Department of Motor Vehicles, and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
