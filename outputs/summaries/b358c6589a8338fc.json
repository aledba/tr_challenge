  "summary": "On May 27, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the City of Clarksdale, Mississippi, in a civil action brought by the Coahoma County Circuit Court against the city.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 20, 2015 in the United States District Court in the District of Mississippi, the city received two bids for the 2014 Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Wastewater Improvements - Contract #1 and Contract #2.  The complaint alleges that, after the bids were unsealed, both bids exceeded the allocated funds by more than ten percent, specifically, $216,182.  As alleged in the complaint, the City's decision to award the contract to Landmark was arbitrary and capricious.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's opinion, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the city from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  In its order, the court also ordered the City to provide a copy of the final judgment to the Commission, which is subject to court approval.   The Commission's order, which was entered by the court on April 21, 2017, orders the Commission to provide an accounting of the bids submitted by Landmark and Hemphill Construction Company, Inc., and that the Commission will consider increasing CDBG and CPU match funds by an additional $141,182 in the amount of funds allocated for the project. The Commission has also agreed to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $100,000 for violations of the bid control provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay disgorgement of more than $200,000 in prejudgment interest and civil penalties.  On June 19, the same day the Commission issued its final judgment, it granted the Commission the right to enter into a contract with Landmark without violating the bidding control provisions. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Mr. Bort. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, the United Arab Emirates Monetary Authority, and the British Columbia Securities Commission in this matter."
