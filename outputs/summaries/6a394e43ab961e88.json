  "summary": "On May 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on August 22, 2013, Gerard Lindquist underwent spinal surgery in which half the patient's teeth were extracted and ill-fitting partial dentures were implanted. According to the complaint, Lindquist was not informed of the fact that a metal object had been left in his back during surgery until May 25, 2017. The complaint further alleges that the patient relied on the dentist's repeated assurances to the patient that he would correct the problem when she returned to the dentist. The SEC alleges that Lindquist failed to inform the patient of the metal object's presence until he was informed of its presence on the day of the procedure.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Lindquist.  On May 9, 2017, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Lindquist to comply with the court's order. The court also issued an order suspending the running of prescription of Lindquist's medical malpractice claims until it was determined whether there was sufficient evidence to justify the suspension.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with interest, imposing civil penalties, and imposing officer-and-director and penny stock bars. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1707 (Feb. 6, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Health Division of New Orleans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Inspector General, and the Louisiana Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
