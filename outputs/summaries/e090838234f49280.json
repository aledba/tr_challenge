  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New Jersey man for unlawfully removing two of his children from New Jersey without first obtaining an order permitting the removal.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in New Jersey on August 8, 2017, defendant unlawfully removed the children of his ex-wife and another New Jersey woman from their New Jersey home.  The court found that defendant knew the statute required that he obtain an order allowing the removal of the children from this jurisdiction before the actual relocation occurred, and that defendant had the burden to show that he had \"cause\" to remove the children before the relocation occurred.  In addition, the court found plaintiff had no obligation to file a motion to revoke or modify the May 2015 order, which required him to provide for overnight parenting time with the children.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the order, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On August 9, 2018, Judge Pickering granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against defendant from removing the children and ordered him to return the children to New Jersey.  He also issued a temporary restraining order against defendant, barring him from appearing before the court as an attorney or practicing before the SEC as a judge, ordering him to comply with the SEC's requirements for a best interests analysis before he makes a decision on the merits of the case.
