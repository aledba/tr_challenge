  "summary": "On January 3, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Postal Regulatory Commission (\"Commission\") in a related administrative proceeding.  The Commission's final judgment, which was entered on Jan. 3, 2020, finds that the Commission failed to adequately account for the costs associated with competitive products.  According to the Commission\u2019s order, in focusing its analysis on the costs of competitive products, it failed to consider the degree to which any costs were uniquely or disproportionately associated with any competitive product.  For example, the Commission concluded that all of the Postal Service's institutional costs must cover at least 5.5% of the total costs of a product or group of products, even if the Commission had already considered those costs when setting the price floor under \u00a7 3633(a)(2).  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the court also ordered the Commission to consider whether it had discharged its responsibility to consider any costs related to competitive products as part of its overall cost attribution methodology.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against UPS for its role in the UPS v. Postal Service litigation.  On January 4, 2019 the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered the Postal Inspection Service to conduct an examination of its costs, and issued an order appointing an independent receiver to determine whether to issue an order imposing an order suspending the suspension of the receiver from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Postal Inspectorate of Inspections and Examinations, including the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and the Office of Inspector General's Retail Strategy Task Force."
