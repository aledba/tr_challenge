  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a federal prisoner who was found guilty of securities fraud and sentenced to 97 months in prison.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Frank J. Teers, a securities broker, engaged in a scheme to obtain multimillion dollar loans from financial institutions under the false representation that one of the codefendants controlled a large bond portfolio that could serve as collateral for the loans.  According to the complaint, Teers agreed to the offer without admitting or denying the allegations in the plea offer, and agreed to a five-year, $60 million penalty.  Teers also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay a $20,000 civil penalty and a $10,000 officer and director bar.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Teers.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver.
