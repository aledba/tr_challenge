  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland today announced criminal charges against Adamou Djibo for orchestrating an international heroin smuggling operation in which he used couriers to traffic heroin from Togo to the United States. Djibo was sentenced to 293 months incarceration to be followed by five years of supervised release.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that Djibo violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that the government failed to show sufficient evidence to justify Djibo's conduct during the government's investigation.  According to the complaint, Djibo consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and requires him to pay disgorgement of $1,921,200, representing the wholesale value of the 32.02 kilograms of heroin seized from Walden, Amankona, and Boahene. The court also granted Djibo a one-day adjournment of the trial to permit him to properly examine the evidence.  Djibo also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any drug, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendant agreed to a permanent injunction and to the appointment of a Swahili translator. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting Djibo from violating the anti-trafficking provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), as well as a court order requiring the government to provide a copy of the complaint to the court. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter."
