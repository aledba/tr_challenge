  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against Marcus L. Roberson, a San Bernardino County resident, for failing to show cause and effect in a public hearing before the city council on July 15, 2008.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Rialto, California, Roberson claimed that he was prejudiced by a July 1, 2008, city council hearing on the project approvals.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to Roberson's claims, the July 1 hearing was defective because it did not include the planning commission's recommendations.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Roberson failed to demonstrate to the trial court that he had any reasonable basis to believe that he would have submitted written comments or testimony at the public hearing had he known of the Planning and Zoning Commission's recommendation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, however, the court granted Roberson a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay $12,860 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his legal fees.  Roberson also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of or purchase of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of service.  Finally, the judgment against Roberson finds that, as a private citizen and resident of the City of Rancho Cucamonga, he has every right to petition the court for a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains, and orders the appointment of a receiver to determine whether to issue a civil injunctive proceeding against him.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the San Diego Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov."
