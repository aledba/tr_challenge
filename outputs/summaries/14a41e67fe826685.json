  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two tax preparers who were convicted of preparing and presenting false tax returns without the taxpayers' knowledge.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the Jenkins brothers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, defendants Fred and Willie Jenkins, who owned and operated a tax preparer business, prepared and presented false returns in violation of the federal tax laws. The complaint alleges that, in 2015, a grand jury returned an indictment charging them with 12 counts of preparing, presenting, and preparing false returns. The court agreed with the complaint that the defendants had caused $14 million of lost tax revenue through their fraud.  In imposing new sentencing orders, the court held both defendants liable for the same amount of tax loss that they had caused.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, impose a five-year prison term, and impose a two-level increase for each of them. The final judgments also order the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,951,321, which is equal to the amount of their already-sentenced prison terms.  On the other hand, the final judgment also imposes a three-year bar on defendants from appearing before the court as an attorney or practicing before a jury.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-1.  This case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
