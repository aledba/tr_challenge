  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against IBM on the merits of a civil injunctive action brought by the State of Indiana against the company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that IBM violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to provide timely and cost-effective information to the court.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the company violated the reporting provisions of Sections 13(a)(1) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, IBM failed to disclose that it had breached the reporting provision of the contract and had failed to comply with the reporting requirements of Section 12(b).  The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the Indiana Attorney General's Office (AGO) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced criminal charges against IBM.  IBM has agreed to settle the SEC's charges against it by agreeing to pay $49.5 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of IBM's damages.  On May 6, 2016, the court granted IBM's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the company to return to pre-MSA staffing levels.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, IBM has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the securities laws, ordering it to pay a $49 million civil penalty, and ordering IBM to pay an additional $9,510,795 in equipment fees and a $10,632,333 civil penalty.  It has also agreed to the appointment of a new trial judge to determine the appropriate amount of pre-judgment interest and to pay civil penalties against IBM for violations of Section 16.3.1, Section 9 of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to provide an accounting for IBM's alleged violations of Exchange Act Rule 12b2-1.  Additionally, IBM agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, security, or other security that may arise from IBM's material breach of the MSA.  As a result, IBM will be required to pay over $100 million in pre-trial fees and $10 million in associated expenses and to be reimbursed by the state as a result of the IBM breach.
