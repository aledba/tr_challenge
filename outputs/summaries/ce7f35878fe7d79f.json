  "summary": "On August 16, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri entered a final judgment against Harley-Davidson Motor Company Group, LLC, on Thomas's motion for a new trial.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on September 2, 2006, Thomas was injured in a motorcycle accident when his motorcycle went off a curve on Highway YY in Saline County, Missouri.  According to the complaint, Thomas, while riding his motorcycle at the time of the accident, the motorcycle went straight off the road and came to rest fifteen feet north of the intersection after hitting an embankment.  As the complaint alleges, Thomas did not see any cause for the motorcycle to roll over and hit the road, and he did not attempt to change his lean angle to prevent the motorcycle from rolling over.  Instead, Thomas allegedly used a computer model to determine the lean angle of the motorcycle.  Thomas' complaint, filed in federal district court in Columbia, Missouri, charges Thomas with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Thomas consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078, and a $100,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Thomas arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On August 17, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Thomas, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Thomas from participating in any future motorcycle-related activities.   The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
