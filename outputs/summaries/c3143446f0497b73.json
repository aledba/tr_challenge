  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania man who has refused to relinquish his parental rights to a child.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on January 15, 2019, alleges that, from approximately August 2013 through August 2018, Father, who lives with Mother, Child, and B.M.D., attempted to contact Child through his attorney, Constance A. Calabrese, Esq., in an effort to preserve the relationship between Father and Child. According to the complaint, however, when Child was in the care of Mother and Stepfather at the time of the contested termination hearing, Father allegedly waited at Mother's home until she returned home. The complaint further alleges that when Child's mother confronted him about his non-attachment to the child, he did not respond. The court ultimately found that Father violated Section 2511(a) of the Pennsylvania Adoption Act, Section 2513(b) of which he is entitled to terminate parental rights. The Court also found that, contrary to the court's findings, Father failed to fulfill his duty as a parent to provide consistently for the physical and emotional needs of a child and failed to adequately represent the child's interests during the court-ordered termination.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Father. The SEC is continuing its investigation into whether or not to file a civil injunctive action against Father, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the Securities Act of 1933, and with aiding and abetting Father's violations of Section 2510(b). The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, Patrick J. McCluskey, and Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Children and Family Education, and the Pennsylvania State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
