  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against two Texas men for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Antonio, Texas, alleges that Texas Attorney General Eric H. Jeffries and Texas State Attorney General Patrick J. McCluskey violated Sections 12.42(c)(2)(A), (B)(5) and (c)(3) of Texas' federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Jeffries was previously convicted of a felony for sodomy with a child under the age of 16 and was previously sentenced to a 10-year prison term for the same conduct.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Jeffries.    The court's order, which was entered by the SEC on May 24, 2018, permanently enjoins Jeffries from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 10 years, $10,000, and a $25,000 civil penalty.  Jeffries agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the federal securities law, ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and imposing a five-year officer-and-director bar.  On May 25, 2019, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the amount of money that Jeffries has already spent on the purchase of a house and on a car.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating these provisions, order them to pay civil penalties, and impose a $75,000 bar. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Attorney-General's Office, and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in this matter."
