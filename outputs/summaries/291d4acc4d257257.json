  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Artez McNeal, a former officer of the Chicago Police Department, for his role in an alleged insider trading scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on December 28, 2016, Officer Michael Callahan of Chicago, Illinois, observed a group of five to eight men standing in the courtyard of an apartment building.  According to the complaint, the men were carrying a.22-caliber revolver, and one of the men was holding a.38-caliber handgun.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Ellerbeck had been barred from testifying about his experience with guns in other cases, and was not certified as a latent print recovery expert.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Officer Callahan did not observe any latent prints on the gun.  Instead, he allegedly retrieved the gun without gloves and, after speaking to the woman in the apartment, retrieved it from under a bed.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC in its Complaint and in its Order of Practice, the Court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, LLC, and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The Court also found that, based on the evidence presented to the court, the defendants were not entitled to a permanent injunction, to a conduct-based injunction, and to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000. The court also granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from making or selling any offer of securities in the securities industry, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock at any time. The SEC also prohibits defendants from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  On January 2, 2019, the court issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the evidence before it could issue an order imposing an injunction, ordering the issuance of a court order, and ordering the destruction of any evidence that may be deemed relevant to the case."
