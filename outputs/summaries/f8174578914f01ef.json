  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced today that it has obtained a final judgment against defendant Lloyd Montgomery and two others for their roles in an opiate distribution conspiracy in Clarksville, Tennessee.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on October 28, 2015, a federal grand jury indicted Montgomery, Merriweather, and Lucas on charges that they had been members of a conspiracy to distribute prescription opiate drugs. According to the complaint, Montgomery was the mastermind of the scheme. The complaint further alleges that he was the only defendant in the conspiracy to purchase and sell prescription drugs from Montgomery, and that Montgomery had access to a flow of prescription drugs. The SEC alleges that Montgomery and Merrilweather were the only people in the house to receive and fill prescriptions from Montgomery. In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants were actively sponsoring people to buy and fill pill prescriptions, including Montgomery's own friends, Anthony Seay and Raymond Poindexter, both of whom were offered cooperation agreements in exchange for their testimony. The court ultimately imposed the same 180-month sentence against Montgomery.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for New York today announced a new sentencing schedule for Montgomery. On January 4, 2017, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Montgomery, ordered him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty, and imposed a five-year, $80,000 officer-and-director bar. On February 22, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Merrill granted the court order against Lucas. On March 24, 2019, Judge Merrill issued a final order granting the temporary restraining injunction against Lucas and Montgomery, ordering a total of 240 months, 216 months, 180 months, and 60 months, respectively. The order also imposed a 10-year officer and director bar against Lucas, ordering him to surrender his passport, and imposing a $50,000 penalty against Seay. The sentencing hearing was conducted in a separate administrative proceeding, and the case was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Mr. Barry and Ms. Barry, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mississippi Department of Criminal Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, the Alabama Department of State Department of Health and Human Services, the State Attorney General's Office, the Tennessee Department of Banking and Securities, the Federal Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the Virginia Department of Insurance, the Georgia Department of Corrections, the Pennsylvania Department of Securities and Exchange Commission, and"
