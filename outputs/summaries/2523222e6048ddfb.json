  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of aggravated assault and sentenced as a career offender.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, alleges that on July 27, 2008, Memphis police officers encountered a disheveled woman in a field behind a Kroger grocery store. According to the complaint, the defendant told the officers that he knew a shortcut through a well-traveled path through the field behind Kroger. The complaint further alleges that he told the officer that he did not want to go down the path with him, that he had torn ligaments in her knee and could not run away, and that he was not going to cooperate with the authorities. The court found that the defendant had sufficient notice of the State\u2019s intent to seek enhanced punishment because he had pleaded guilty to theft of property more than thirty-five times in a previous criminal case. The Court of Criminal Appeals agreed with the court that the State should have filed a timely and proper notice of its intent to request enhanced punishment.  In its judgment, the court held that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Williams consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On February 2, 2016, a federal district court in Jackson, Tenn., entered an order granting the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordering him to surrender his passport. The SEC previously issued an order freezing the assets of the defendants and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $50,000 each.  A hearing on February 5, 2016 was scheduled for 7:45 p.m. The hearing was adjourned until 10:30 a.m., and the jury deliberated for two hours before proceeding to a hearing scheduled for February 4, 2016. The case was reviewed by David Demar Ayliffe, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, and John Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Demar and Ms. Davis.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Tennessee Department of Justice in this matter."
