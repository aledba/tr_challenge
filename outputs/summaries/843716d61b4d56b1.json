  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Waterford, Wisconsin, police officer who was charged with misconduct in the course of conducting a field sobriety test.  According to the SEC's complaint, on September 16, 2014, Deputy Kevin Burke was stopped by Officer Demarasse while driving southbound on State Highway 164 in Waterford. The complaint alleges that Burke told the officer that he observed a large amount of blood on the back of her shirt and pants when he arrived at the scene to evaluate whether she appeared under the influence of an intoxicant or controlled substance.  The complaint further alleges that the officer repeatedly instructed his client not to answer, failed to limit her objections to the form of the question, and threatened to leave the deposition.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Wisconsin today announced criminal charges against Burke.  On January 19, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Burke, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Burke's violations of Rule 30(c)(2) and Rule 30b-3 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Burke consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.95, prejudgment interest of $2,077.95 and a civil penalty of $10,000.00. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Wisconsin Department of Justice in this matter."
