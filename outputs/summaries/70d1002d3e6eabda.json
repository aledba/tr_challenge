  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Century Surety Company, Inc., a California-based insurance company, for failing to adequately defend its insured, Grant Park Villas Homeowners Association.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco on October 24, 2017, Century agreed to a judgment that permanently restrains its obligation to defend the insured against claims arising out of a multi-million dollar default judgment against Grant Park Development.  The SEC alleges that Century failed to adequately assess the impact of the default judgment on Grant Park's insured and failed to provide a reasonable defense.  As alleged in the complaint, the settlement demand was for a total of $850,000, which was well within the policy limits.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Century consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Century for its role in this matter.  On October 26, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans granted Century's request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of the federal securities laws and ordered the company to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Daniel M. Mascianica and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Office of Insurance Regulation."
