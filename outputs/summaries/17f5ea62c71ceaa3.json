  "summary": "On September 19, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California entered a final judgment in favor of the District of Columbia against Barry Winograd, a former hearing officer for the District.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, on May 17, 2016, a hearing officer at the District's request for a writ of mandamus (MOU) found that the District violated Section 5 of the MOU and Rules 5b2-3 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that the hearing officer improperly used a \"comparative analysis\" procedure in job postings to identify internal candidates who did not meet minimum qualifications for a position.  As alleged in the complaint, the comparative analysis procedure was not authorized by the District to be used as part of the recruitment and selection process.  In addition, the complaint alleged that, based on the evidence presented, only those candidates demonstrating the strongest backgrounds would be invited to participate in a written test and oral panel interview.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's judgment, the District consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating MOU Section 5.2 and Rule 5b4 thereunder, and orders it to cease and desist from using the term in its application and selection procedures.  AFSCME also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
