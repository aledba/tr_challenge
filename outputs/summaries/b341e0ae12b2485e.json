  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a Texas man charged with concealing the identity of his children and seeking to terminate his parental rights.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Antonio, Texas, alleges that, from at least 2013 through at least 2014, Antonio \"Tony\" Rodriguez, a convicted felon and convicted felon, falsely claimed that he was the father of E.A.M.V., a three-month-old child, when, in fact, Rodriguez had been incarcerated for indecency with a child and had failed to complete any of the services in his service plan.  According to the complaint, Rodriguez also failed to respond to the Department of Family and Protective Services' petition by timely filing an admission of paternity or a counterclaim for paternity.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Rodriguez failed to provide any evidence to support the Department's finding that Rodriguez had violated Section 161.001(b)(1) of the family code.  Rodriguez has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,038,767, a civil penalty of $100,000, and a $10,000 officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying Rodriguez's allegations, Rodriguez has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Rodriguez to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  On May 2, 2019, the court granted Rodriguez's motion for a temporary restraining order against Rodriguez and ordered Rodriguez to comply with the court's order.
