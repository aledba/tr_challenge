  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Montana today entered a final judgment against Richard \"Rick\" Brandt for operating a Ponzi scheme that ultimately defrauded investors of more than $2 million.  The SEC's complaint alleges that from 2011 until 2015, Brandt ran an ostensibly legitimate house-flipping business, Home Investors LLC. He allegedly solicited investments from elderly individuals, many of whom he knew from church or because he had served as their financial advisor or insurance salesman.  As alleged in the complaint, from 2011 through 2015, when he was charged with six counts of fraud, he allegedly used investor funds to buy houses, renovate them, and sell them at much higher prices.  Brandt also allegedly made payments to earlier investors, including $20,000 owed to her assisted living facility.  According to the SEC, after several years he ran out of money and stopped making payments to his investors.  In a parallel action, the Montana Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Brandt, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 46-11-410 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 46-10-410, MCA.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint filed in federal court in Mont. \u00c2\u00a0Washington, D.C.\u00c2\u00a0On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the District Court of Montana entered a judgment permanently enjoining Brandt from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.   The court also ordered Brandt to pay restitution of $88,000 to a victim who lost approximately $1,000 in personal expenses, and to pay an officer-and-director bar in a parallel criminal case.  On May 26, 2019, the court granted the court's motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws.
