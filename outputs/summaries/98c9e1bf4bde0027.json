  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Victor Gastelum for the first degree murder of Terrance Rodgers.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Riverside, California, alleges that, on June 9, 2016, Gastelums, a California resident, engaged in a pattern of lying-in-wait murder in front of a liquor store to find and kill at least J.W. Rodgers, a mutual friend of Rodgers'.  According to the complaint, after learning that Rodgers had been shot at the liquor store by a fellow felon, he confronted him and told him that he could be convicted of first degree premeditated murder under the natural and probable consequences doctrine.  Instead, the complaint alleges that he did not act surprised or surprised by the shooting, and instead, he fled with Gamboa and recorded a video celebrating the killing.  In its judgment, the court found that, based on the evidence presented to the jury, that the defendant was not liable for first-degree premeditation murder because he had suffered a prior felony conviction for domestic battery and had not remained free from both prison custody and the commission of a new felony for a five-year period after discharge.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final Judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  On June 10, 2017, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to issue an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.  Sansone also agreed to the appointment of a receiver to facilitate the receiver's transfer of receiver information to the receiver, and to pay disgorgement of $1,078, which is equal to his pre-judgment interest and a penalty of $10,000.  As a result, the receiver will be barred from associating with any person who is not a convicted felon and from participating in any type of criminal activity, including securities law enforcement, including the issuance of a cease-and-desist order, and the issuance and purchase of a security deposit.  To settle this matter, the SEC has agreed to a permanent receiver order and to a penny-per-share bar from the receiver"
