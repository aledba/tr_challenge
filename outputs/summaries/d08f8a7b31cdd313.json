  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, stay an action brought by the children and heirs of Gagik and Knarik Galstian, who were forced to abandon them in September 1978 when the family fled to Los Angeles after the overthrow of the Shah.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 7, 2013, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, California, and unsealed yesterday, defendants Shahen Minassian and Nader Izadi held the powers of attorney for the remaining properties in Iran.  The complaint alleges that Minassian, who was previously designated and qualified as an expert on issues relating to the Iranian legal system, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Minassian.  Minassian has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to submit to the jurisdiction of an Iranian court, and requires him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $1,000.  Additionally, Minassian agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $100,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint, the defendants have consented to a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $150,000, and imposing a $75,000 bar on Minassian's and Izadi's companies. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David A. Cohen, Mark R. Sylvester, and Glenn S. Gordon of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Reza Athari and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.K. Attorney's Department for the Middle District of America, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Financial Conduct Authority."
