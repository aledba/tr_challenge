  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The complaint also alleges that he failed to preserve the issue of whether the jury should consider Deleon's failure to testify in reaching a verdict by failing to tell the jury that the evidence and the court's instructions should be the only basis for your decision.
