  "summary": "On September 25, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi entered a final judgment ordering the forfeiture of six horses, four cats and three dogs.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Michael Dancy, a Mississippi resident, misappropriated the horses, cats and dogs of a Mississippi-based dairy farm.  According to the complaint, Dancy was charged with animal cruelty for not caring for the horses and for failing to reimburse Redemption Road Rescue for all of the expenses incurred by the farm during the forfeiture and animal-cruelty proceedings.  Dancy also was found guilty of violating Section 97-41-2(2)(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and ordered to pay $39,225 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Dancy.  On September 5, 2018 in the case-in-chief of the SEC's Mississippi Division of Enforcement, the court issued an order suspending Dancy from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering Dancy to pay a $40,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer and director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, dancy consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay an $8,500 civil penalty in the amount of one year.  After the court's order was issued, the complaint alleges that Dancy violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Section 17(a)(2)(A) the securities laws and orders Dancy liable for the costs of boarding and boarding of the horses.  Additionally, the order requires Dancy be permanently enjoined from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock other than for the purpose of recovering the penny stock.  Finally, the SEC alleges that the court improperly suspended Dancy's civil penalty for one year and ordered him to reimburse redemption road rescue for costs incurred in caring for and boarding the horses during the pendency of the forfeiture, and that the same amount of money should be paid to the owner of the stolen Corvette.   The complaint also alleges that, in a parallel administrative proceeding, the judge improperly suspended the civil penalty Dancy had previously agreed to under Section 10"
