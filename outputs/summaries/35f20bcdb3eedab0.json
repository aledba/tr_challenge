  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a child sexual abuse case, finding that he was deficient in his capacity as a lawyer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Ricardo R. Keeney, a resident of Greenwich, Conn., made material misrepresentations to a trial counsel about his understanding of the relevant forensic psychology concepts, including hypersexuality, acting out, and grooming behavior, in order to convince the trial counsel that he had a reasonable basis to believe that the defendant was capable of accurately representing the victims and their perpetrators. The complaint further alleges that, as a result of his lack of experience and training in the field of child sexual assault, Keeneier failed to adequately evaluate the evidence presented in the case and failed to provide evidence to support his claims.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Keneier.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on May 24, 2016, unsealed on May 25, 2016 and unsealed yesterday in federal district court in Manhattan, the SEC charged Keeneer with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (\"Advisers\"), Rule 206(3) and (4)-8 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 26, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the New York District Court issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order, imposing a $150,000 civil penalty, and ordering the SEC to conduct a conduct-based examination of the alleged victims and perpetrators.  Separately, on May 23, 2017, a federal judge in Manhattan entered an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation. The receiver will determine the amount of restitution to be paid to the receiver, and will determine whether to issue an officer-and-director bar.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Department of Health and Human Services."
