  "summary": "On May 27, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky entered a final judgment against Paschall Truck Lines, Inc.'s (EFC) and Quality Equipment Leasing, LLC (Quality) violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky, alleges that, on or around March 12, 2014, Paschall and Quality entered into a Vehicle Lease Program Agreement with Element Financial Corp. (\"EFC\") that required EFC to provide vehicle leasing and financing services to drivers and fleets in Kentucky.  According to the complaint, the EFC and Quality agreed to participate in a long-term leasing partnership agreement with EFC.  As alleged, however, the defendants did not make any specific contacts with the state of Kentucky beyond the vehicle lease program agreement.  In addition, the court found that the defendants' actions did not amount to a \"substantial connection\" with Kentucky when the defendants had engaged in a \"transacting business\" in Kentucky when, in fact, they did not engage in any business in Kentucky beyond entering an agreement with a Kentucky plaintiff.  For example, the complaint alleges that Paschall, ECN, and Quality violated Section 5(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b2-1 thereunder, and that the court had no jurisdiction over the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, and prejudgment interest of $2,065, and ordering them each to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the Court ordered Quality to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of EFC's violations, which is continuing, with the assistance of the Kentucky Division of Securities and Exchange Commission's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) and the Kentucky Office of Financial Regulation.  EFC has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $75,000, respectively, in the amount of $20,000 each, and requires it to provide a copy of the Commission's order to the Kentucky Department of Banking and Securities and the Indiana Department of Insurance.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John R. Rymas and Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Retail Strategy Task Force."
