  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the Social Security Administration's (SSA) decision to deny her application for disability benefits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that the SSA violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, in 2013, Ms. Perkins filed an application for Social Security benefits with the SEC alleging that she suffered from various mental health disorders and a right-foot deformity from third-degree burns as a child, and that she was unable to work prior to applying for benefits because of these impairments.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Dr. Broadnax failed to adequately consider the evidence presented in the record, including medical signs and laboratory findings, and failed to properly consider the treatment of the physician who repeatedly opined that the claimant could not lift, reach, or stoop.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins the agency from future violations of the \"treating physician rule\" and orders it to conduct a fact-finding investigation. The court also ordered the SEC to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000 and a $100,000 officer and director bar.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendant, charging him with violations of Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil monetary penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order requiring the defendant to surrender his or her passport in order to obtain the benefit.   The court's order also prohibits the defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply for the benefit upon motion of the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-14.  Separately, the Department of Health and Human Services today announced that it has issued an order appointing an independent receiver to determine whether a person with a history of mental illness can apply for and receive benefits. The SEC also announced that the receiver would be required to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver. The receiver, however, has yet to respond to the SEC"
