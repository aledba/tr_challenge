  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Southwest Airline Company, LLC and its co-founders, Chase Roberts and Pavel Yurevich, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, Texas, the defendants violated the federal securities laws by failing to timely respond to requests for a temporary restraining order, a cease-and-desist letter, or an order requiring the defendants to shut down their website.  The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims, and that the court ultimately granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On November 8, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Southwest, charging the defendants with violations of Section 12(b)(6) and 13(a)(1) and 14(a), and charging them with aiding and abetting violations of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-6 and 13a-1.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Southwest consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC's litigation will be led by C. Wright and Amy C. Welshhans.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Insurance, the U. S. Attorney's Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
