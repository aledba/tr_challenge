  "summary": "On January 24, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi entered a final judgment against the city of Jackson, Mississippi, ordering a seventeen-day suspension without pay for two separate incidents in mid-September 2017.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, alleges that on September 9, 2017, Officer Toni Howard, a patrol officer with the Columbus Police Department, left her assigned beat without permission, and two days later she exhibited conduct unbecoming an officer and improperly used her taser around a handcuffed and shackled arrestee.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that Officer Howard violated the department's policies and procedures, including requiring officers to show reasonable cause for discipline, and that she was not given permission to leave her beat that day.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Mississippi announced criminal charges against Officer Howard.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, Officer Howard was suspended for three and fourteen working days without pay, with the suspensions to run concurrently, for the two incidents at issue.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Howard consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her suspended suspension.  On January 26, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action against the City of Jackson for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-to-officer and conduct-based injunctive relief.  A hearing scheduled for February 21, 2020, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. EST. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mississippi Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Office of Inspector General in this matter.  For further information, see Press Release No. 13-20-17."
