  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found incompetent to stand trial.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Hampshire, alleges that, on August 12, 2013, Mohammad Salimullah, a convicted felon who was previously sentenced to 30 years to life for attempted murder, attempted to commit a felony, and attempted to evade the court's requirements for a competency determination prior to sentencing.  According to the complaint, the court improperly allowed the defendant to obtain a new indictment on the basis that he had no memory of the alleged attack on his wife or the events leading to his arrest.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant began claiming memory loss only after the charges against him were reinstated, and that, by denying his motion to dismiss, he had reached a level of despondency after trial such that he could not afford to file a new competency evaluation.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  To learn more about competency laws, see Litigation Reform, Litigation Release Release Release No. 17-a-1 (2014).  The complaint also charges the defendant with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2)(A), and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.   The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, Patrick J. McCluskey, and Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Hampshire Department of Corrections, and the Massachusetts Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
