  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a former member of The Commodores, Thomas McClary, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 43(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 43(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that McClary violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of The Securities Act of 1933.  According to the complaint, McClary was not entitled to the common-law rights to the marks because he was not a member of the original group.  McClary also allegedly did not have the right to use the marks in connection with his own musical performances.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, when McClary left the group in 1984, he left behind his \"Common Law Rights\" and his \"Membership and Trademark Rights\" with CEC.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal registration provisions, and orders McClary to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains with respect to the other defendants.  Finally, the court granted McClary's motion for summary judgment on the merits of the case, without requiring him to provide any evidence to support his claims, and without ordering him to comply with the court's order.  On May 31, 2016, the SEC filed an emergency action against McClary and CEC, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  To learn more about this matter, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 20, 2016).  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against McCollum for his role in the scheme of the scheme.  A hearing on June 5, 2016 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  After the hearing, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the SEC issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order, ordering McClary not to violate the federal securities laws, and ordering CEC to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty.   The court granted the SEC request for a hearing on July 24, 2016 and entered a preliminary injunction on July 26, 2016."
