  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of G.S., a seven-year-old boy who suffers from a brain injury.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, New York, alleges that, on June 6, 2018, the New York City Department of Education (DOE) issued an IOP finding that a student with a severe brain injury was entitled to a \"free appropriate public education\" (FAPE).  According to the complaint, the DOE's IOP found that the student was not entitled to pendency funding under Section 1415(j) of the Education Act of 1940, and that the DOE did not consider the merits of the IOP's finding.  In its final judgment, the court found that, based on the evidence submitted by the parents, the student should remain in the FAPE for the 2018\u20132019 school year until the moment when the child's pendency changes.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the DOE to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On January 9, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the United States District Court in Brooklyn entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the anti-fraud provisions. The court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the DOE not to violate the federal anti-divergence provisions of Section 15(j).  The court also granted the parents' request for an emergency court order halting the DOE from issuing an injunction, ordering a hearing officer to conduct a due diligence review of the case, and appointing an independent hearing officer for the case.  A hearing officer will be appointed by the court upon motion of the parties.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1415 (D.N.Y. July 27, 2019).  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against G. S. for his role in the iHope case. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Office of Inspector General of Education in this matter."
