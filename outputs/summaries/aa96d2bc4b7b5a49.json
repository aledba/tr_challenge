  "summary": "On June 18, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against SEPTA, a Pennsylvania-based company that employed Franklin A. Darius as a welder and rail maintainer. The court granted the company's motion for summary judgment on June 19, 2018.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that, beginning in 2007 and continuing to the present, the Pennsylvania Department of Workforce Development (PWDD) employed Darius as an employee as part of its Accident and Illness Prevention Program (AIPP). The complaint alleges that the AIPP is a safety rule designed to address foreseeable risks to an employee that are increased by the employee's presence at the workplace. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the amount that the company has paid to be determined by the court at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In its order granting summary judgment, the court found that the defendants breached their duty under the FELA by failing to implement the safety rule, which requires employees to show reasonable foreseeability of the risk of an injury or death before they are liable to a jury. The order also ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million, $1 million, and $500,000, respectively. The SEC also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and barring them from participating in the issuance of any civil injunctive relief.  On June 21, 2019, the Court granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, ordered a hearing on the matter, and appointed a receiver to determine whether to proceed with the litigation.  According to the order unsealed today, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter.
