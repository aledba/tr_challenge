  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Ohio resident John J. Gallick in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Gallick violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Gallick failed to timely respond to the SEC's requests for a new trial.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed an emergency action against Gallick, charging him with violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b2-1 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Gallick's violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Attorney General has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Gallick from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of $4,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Gallick has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  On June 13, 2014, the court granted Gallick a temporary restraining order and ordered him to comply with the court's order, which requires him to show cause and effect, including that he has consented to a permanent injunction, to a conduct-based injunction, and to a hearing on the merits of his claims. The court also ordered Gallick to provide a copy of the final judgment, which is subject to approval by the court.  Finally, on June 20, 2018, the Court issued an order appointing a receiver for Gallick and ordering him to provide an accounting of the value of the Livingston Avenue properties. The receiver will determine the amount of any civil penalty that will be imposed upon him at a later date.  A hearing on July 24, 2018 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.
