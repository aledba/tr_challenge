  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment against Cynthia Marie Munson, a former employee, certified public accountant, and the former Chief Financial Officer of Pioneer Title, for her role in a scheme to steal millions of dollars from the company.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Idaho, Munson was previously convicted of grand theft in 2014 and sentenced to prison for five years.  The SEC alleges that Munson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that she was liable for a civil penalty of $1.3 million.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Munson.  Munson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for 10 years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Central District of California entered a judgment against Munon, finding her liable for three counts of theft and ordering her to disgorge $1,3 million in ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Munon agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the federal criminal laws, ordering a conduct-based injunction, and prohibiting her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged scheme. The court also ordered Munson to comply with the SEC\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order, an accounting, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, as well as an order requiring her to surrender her passport and other documents, and a court order barring her from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.
