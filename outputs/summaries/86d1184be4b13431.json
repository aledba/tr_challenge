  "summary": "On May 16, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota entered a final judgment against Guy Rabold, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 240 months in prison for aiding and abetting a first-degree robbery.  The court found that Rabold was a danger to public safety and a \"dangerous offender\" for purposes of an upward departure.  According to the court's order, Rabold had epilepsy and at one point during the assault was fearful an epileptic seizure might be triggered.  Rabold told the victims that he had previously dated the victim's daughter and had been to her home before the night of the crime.  He also allegedly told the victim that he knew about the victims' vulnerability and planned to steal their contents to pay off his debts.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Minnesota today announced criminal charges against Rabold arising from the same conduct.  On May 17, 2018, the court issued a temporary restraining order halting Rabold from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Rabold to pay a penalty of 240 months.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.    The final judgment also imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar on Rabold.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 596 (Minn. App. 1984).  The SEC's complaint charges Rabold with violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 596 of the Exchange Act and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunctive relief, and an order to bar him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in a public place, including the right to reapply after five years of imprisonment. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry in the Minneapolis Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Minnesota Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Minnesota Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
