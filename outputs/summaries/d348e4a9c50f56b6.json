  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment finding that defendant Christopher Shawn Strike of Orange County, California, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 186.22(a) of the federal criminal laws.  The court also found that defendant had a prior gang participation conviction that qualified as a strike under the federal securities laws, and that he did not commit a felony with another member of his gang.  In a bifurcated proceeding, the court found defendant had been convicted of a prior felony for gang participation in violation of the \"Three Strikes\" law.  According to the court's order, Strike pleaded guilty in 2007 to one felony count of gang participation for which he had been previously convicted.  As alleged in the complaint, Strike had been a member of a criminal street gang and promoted, assisted, or furthered a pattern of criminal conduct by members of that gang, and had been charged with a felony prior to his conviction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Strike consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of this federal law, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, a $50,000 civil penalty, and a $75,000 bar.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court of Appeal granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Strike to be enjoined from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of the United States District Judge in the Division of Criminal Justice, with the assistance of Assistant Chief of the Division's Office of Public Affairs. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Attorney General's Office, the Orange County Sheriff's Department, and the California Department of Banking and Securities and Investments."
