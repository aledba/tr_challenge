  "summary": "On November 26, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the defendants in a related administrative proceeding.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albany, New York, the defendants agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  The court also granted the defendants' motion for leave to take discovery, which was granted by the court on May 13, 2013.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants violated the deliberative process provision of the federal environmental laws and ordered the defendants to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants consented to a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933, and ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay a civil penalty, and pay a $1,500 civil penalty.  On May 16, 2014, the Court issued a temporary restraining order halting the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael P. Mascianica and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Department of Health, the Department of Environmental Conservation, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
