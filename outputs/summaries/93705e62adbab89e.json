  "summary": "On June 5, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Inc., a non-denominational Christian church located in Laurel, Maryland.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Baltimore, Maryland, on February 9, 2017, the Court found that the City of Laurel violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The Court also found that, contrary to the Church's claims, the city did not apply for a special exception for houses of worship located on less than one acre in the C-V zone.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Maryland today announced criminal charges against the church.

On June 13, the same day the court issued a temporary restraining order against the city, prohibiting it from enforcing the federal, state, and local laws, ordering the church and its affiliated entities to comply, and imposing a $250-per-day civil penalty against each of them.   The court also granted the Church and its associated entities the right to a preliminary injunction against future violations of federal law, and ordered the City to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court as to whether it is appropriate to impose a civil injunctive relief.  Finally, on June 9, the SEC filed a motion for summary judgment in favor of the Church, which is pending approval by the court.  This action is subject to court approval, and the court will determine the amount of monetary relief to be provided by the church, the associated entities, and"
