  "summary": "On May 10, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against Timothy Jeffries, a former BJA Associate Deputy Director, for his non-selection for seven positions within the Bureau of Justice Assistance.  The court found that Jeffries violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, Jeffries consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Jeffries also agreed to be permanently enjoined from further violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 12a-1, and 13a-11 thereunder, and to be barred from associating with any person or entity with which he has engaged in any form of sexual harassment.  In addition, the court granted the SEC's motion for summary judgment against Jeffries.  On May 17, 2017 the court entered a judgment against the defendant, ordering him to disgorge ill-advised gains with prejudgment interests, and ordering him not to participate in any promotional selection for the three positions for which he was not selected.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the federal anti-harassment laws, imposing a $75,000 civil penalty and prohibiting him from participating in the selection of anyone other than a BJA employee.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Compliance, the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Office of Financial Regulation in this matter."
