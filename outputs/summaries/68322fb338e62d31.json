  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (\"R.J.\" Reynolds) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on December 14, 2017, filed in federal district court in Miami, Florida, Smith, a resident of Lake Worth, Texas, claimed that a jury found him liable on all of his claims, including for his wife\u2019s injuries. The complaint alleges that the jury found for Smith that he was not entitled to a reduction of damages based on the jury finding that his wife bore some responsibility for her injuries.  The complaint further alleges that, in fact, the jury did not find Smith liable on any of the claims, because it had already found that Smith was liable on the intentional tort claims.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Smith failed to disclose to the jury that he had requested an instruction that would reduce the amount of compensatory damages he would receive based on his own negligence, even though he knew the jury had found her liable.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Smith consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $330,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Miami Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Milyard. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Department of Insurance, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, and the Florida Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
