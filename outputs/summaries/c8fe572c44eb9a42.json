  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota yesterday entered a final judgment against a St. Paul, Minnesota resident who filed a petition to amend the city charter.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minneapolis, alleges that, on July 7, 2017, Peter K. Butler, a registered Minnesota resident, submitted a petition with 7,656 signatures to the Minnesota Secretary of State\u2019s Office for the purpose of certifying signatures on a home rule city charter amendment petition.  According to the complaint, the secretary of state and the elections office reviewed the petition and deemed that it was insufficient to qualify the petition for inclusion on the November 2017 ballot.  Appellant, however, claimed that, following the receipt of the original notice of insufficiency, he was unable to obtain additional signatures because he was waiting for a legal determination to be made on the original petition. The complaint further alleges that he failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claim that he had obtained additional signatures.  In its judgment, the court found no error in the verification process and dismissed the petition in part.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Butler consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, which he will pay in a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Minnesota Department of State's Office of Elections, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Minnesota Office of Inspector General in this matter."
