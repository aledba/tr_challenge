  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Hawai'i today entered a final judgment against Brok Carlton, a defendant convicted of kidnapping as a class A felony, in violation of the due process provisions of the federal securities laws.  The court found that Carlton violated the right of presentence allocution, which requires the court to determine whether a defendant is entitled to a fair trial and to the opportunity to make a statement before sentence is imposed.  According to the court's order, filed on July 11, 2014, Carlton was found guilty after a jury trial in the Circuit Court of the Second Circuit of Hawaii of kidnapping, robbery, and assault. The court ruled that Carlton was entitled to an opportunity to address the court before sentencing, and that the court should consider his conduct while in custody and determine whether to impose consecutive sentences.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Carlton. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Hawaii, charges Carlton with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Carlton consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and a $25,000 officer and director bar.  On May 15, 2017, the court issued an order suspending Carlton from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to provide an accounting of the amount of time he has already spent in prison and on remand. The order also prohibits the defendant from participating in the sentencing of a criminal case without prior authorization from the court or from providing any assistance in the selection of a sentencing judge.   The Court's order also requires the defendant to provide a written statement to the SEC before he makes a decision about his sentencing. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Hoke and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Scott A. Kasper. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Cohen and Carol A. Levin of the Boston Regional Office, with assistance from Eric R. Werner of the Office of International Affairs, and was supervised by Joseph A. Sansone, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit."
