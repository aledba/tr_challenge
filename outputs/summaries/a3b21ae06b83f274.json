  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan today entered final judgments in favor of Chase Bank, N.A. and/or The Larry J. Winget Living Trust in a Chapter 11 petition for bankruptcy.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Detroit, Michigan, alleges that Chase violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Guaranty of the Investment Company Act of 1940.  According to the complaint, Chase, as an administrative agent for a group of lenders that extended credit to Venture pursuant to a Credit Agreement signed in 1999, was entitled to a right to collect on the obligations under Section 17.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of Chase\u2019s failure to comply with these obligations, Chase was liable for $11,154,874.65 in costs and expenses incurred in pursuing the Guaranteed Obligations.   The complaint further alleges that the District Court improperly denied Chase a partial satisfaction of all of its judgments against Winget and the Trust in the 2005 and 2006 actions.  Chase has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On June 28, 2016, the court granted Chase a temporary restraining order and ordered the asset freeze and other emergency relief to be placed on the assets of both the Trust and Winget.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Chase has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Section 17 and ordering Chase to pay civil penalties of up to $50 million, including attorney fees and costs, in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion by the parties.  Additionally, Chase agreed to pay $10,000 in administrative fees and $1,500 in fees and expenses, which is the amount owed to Winget by Chase.  It also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the public company.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 589, 600 (Mar. 24, 2014).  The Commission on Audit and Rulemaking has issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent examination of its books and records to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support its findings.  Among other things, the Commission has issued a subpoena for Chase to provide an accounting of the company's assets and to provide a copy of the subpoena"
