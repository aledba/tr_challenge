  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Mahanoy Area High School's cheerleading coach for her use of profane, off-campus speech.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 25, 2017, B.L. began practicing cheerleading in fifth grade and was on the squad when she was not participating in any school activity. The complaint alleges that one of her cheerleading coaches pulled her out of class to inform her that she was being suspended from the squad.  The complaint further alleges that the coach told her that the school had the right to punish her for the out-of-school speech, and that the principal believed that her Snap was \"demeaning to [the] coach], the school, and the rest of the cheerleaders.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against B. L. Gibson, a former cheerleader who was suspended for using profanity on school property. Gibson has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,065, prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000. Gibson consented to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Education, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services."
