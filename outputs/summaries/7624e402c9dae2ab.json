  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against Mark T. Salary, Jr., a Kansas City, Kan., resident who was convicted of two counts of premeditated murder and one count of arson for setting fire to Estell's home.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City on March 24, 2018, Salary was convicted by a jury of one of those counts and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for 50 years (hard 50) for the murder conviction. The complaint alleges that the jury found that the alleged murder was particularly heinous, atrocious, or cruel, and the judge only cut Salary's response short when it became apparent that he had wanted to speak to an attorney during the interrogation.  The complaint further alleges that after the resentencing hearing, the court denied all of Salary's requests for an asset freeze and ordered him to wait until after sentencing to determine whether he was entitled to a second direct appeal.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Salary consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Salary. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Kansas Division of Criminal Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Department for the Eastern District of Missouri, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kansas Department of Criminal Justice, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Missouri Department of Justice Criminal Division's Office of Inspector General, the FBI's Kansas Field Office, the Criminal Investigations Division's Public Finance Abuse Unit, the Office of the Chief Trial Counsel, the Division of Justice's Criminal Justice Division, the Department of Homeland Security, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages the public to check the background of anyone offering or offering to offer assistance in a criminal case by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Litigation.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether there are any errors or omissions in the record."
