  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment in favor of the Black & Decker Corp. and Delta International Machinery Corporation in a related civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on August 23, 2012, Ismael Lopez, a resident of El Paso, Texas, was injured while using a table saw manufactured by Delta. The complaint alleges that the company was not liable for Mr. Lopez's injuries because it did not design, manufacture, market, or sell the table saw. Instead, the complaint alleges, the defendants were liable as Delta's corporate successors because they did not assume Delta\u2019s liabilities in the PA.  The complaint further alleges that, based on the facts of the case, Lopez had failed to identify with specificity facts that he had not received the PA from the defendants until two weeks before the hearing.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In a parallel action, on May 23, 2016, the New Mexico state court granted Lopez a temporary restraining order and ordered him to file a second amended complaint. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Insurance in this matter."
