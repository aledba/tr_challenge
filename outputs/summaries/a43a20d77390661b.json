  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of South Dakota today entered a final judgment against American Legion Home Association Post 22, a charitable organization based in Rapid City, South Dakota, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Columbia, American Legion raised the issue of whether it was entitled to a 100% exemption under the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that American Legion used the property primarily for charitable purposes, including to serve veterans and to raise funds for veterans and the community.  In its complaint, the complaint alleged that the property was used exclusively for benevolent purposes and that it was not entitled to an exemption because it did not directly use the property for charitable or charitable purposes.  It also alleged that, in Hayes and Moose Lodge, the property had been leased to a non-benevolent third party to operate a retail store and not used by the charitable organizations.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the defendants did not own the property and instead rented it to a third party for business or profit-producing purposes, which American Legion claimed was exempt from taxation.  American Legion also failed to file an affidavit of attorney fees for the purposes of obtaining an exemption under Section 15-6-9 of the Exchange Act, which provides for an exemption for charitable and charitable purposes in the event of a court order granting an exemption to the charitable organization.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's judgment, the court agreed to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins American Legion from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders it to pay $14,704.18 in attorney fees and tax pursuant to SDCL 10-4-9. The court also ordered American Legion to provide an accounting of the amount of fees paid to the entity pursuant to that order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Public Finance Abuse Unit and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, with assistance from Erickson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
