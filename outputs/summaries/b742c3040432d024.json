  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Ruhof Corporation, an alleged nonparty tortfeasor, in a medical malpractice action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on September 1, 2010, a doctor performed surgery on a patient's knee at appellant's surgical facility.  According to the complaint, after the surgery, the patient became infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria, which caused the patient to become infected with the bacteria.  As alleged, the doctor paid the patient $4,118.23 for the medical expenses he incurred in treating the knee infection.   The complaint further alleges that the doctor did not sign an agreement releasing him from liability because he did not know how, when, or where the bacteria had entered the plastic bag.  In addition, the complaint alleges that on January 24, 2012, more than 15 months after receiving the payment of the patient's medical expenses, the defendant filed an instant action against him, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins the defendants from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of $543,034, prejudgment interest of $285,114, and a civil penalty of $100,000. \u00c2\u00a0The court also granted the defendants' motion for a bifurcated jury trial, which is subject to court approval.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against one of the defendants, Marc Esquenet, for his role in a fraudulent scheme to defraud a New York-based medical device manufacturer.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against another defendant for the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On March 2, 2013, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of California entered a judgment ordering a preliminary injunction against further violations of the anti-fraud provisions, ordering the defendant to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, and ordering the receiver to pay $1,000 in civil penalties and a $25,000 civil penalty.  Finally, on March 13, 2014, the trial court entered a temporary restraining order against the receiver, ordering him to pay a $5,034 civil penalty and ordering a conduct-based injunction against future violations.
