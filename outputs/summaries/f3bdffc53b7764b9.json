  "summary": "On June 2, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Bremen Police Department officers Bradley Kile and Ronald Rybicki unlawfully conducted a search and arrest of a resident of Dobbie's home on April 2, 2015, resulting in the arrest and prosecution of Mr. Dobbie for possession of marijuana and paraphernalia.  According to the complaint, the defendants were not entitled to absolute immunity because they were not permitted to participate in performing their prosecutorial duties.  In addition, the SEC alleges that the defendants failed to adequately disclose to the officers that they had conducted a warrantless search of the residence and arrested Dobbie on the same day.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their civil penalties.  On June 15, 2016, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, entered a default judgment, and issued a temporary restraining order against the Defendants from further violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties equal to their respective civil penalties of $10,000 each.\u00c2\u00a0The defendants have also agreed to pay $1,000 in disgorging and prejudgment interests, which includes $2,500 in officer-and-director fees and a $100,000 civil penalty for each of the defendants.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (March 17, 2008).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Chicago Regional Office, under the supervision of Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Michigan, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in the Chicago Field Office."
