  "summary": "On March 9, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana entered a final judgment against Jose Andrade, a landlord who owns thirty-two properties with a total of sixty-two rental units.  The court found that Andrade exceeded its statutory authority when it ordered him to restore the 6609 Jefferson Avenue Home in Hammond to a single-family dwelling.  According to the court's order, Andrade failed to comply with the Board's finding that the Home was structurally unsafe because it had impaired structural conditions, fire hazards, and ordinance violations.  In addition, the court ruled that the home was not structurally safe when it was built in 1927 and that the Board had an obligation to enforce its finding.  As a result of this non-compliance, the Board ordered Andrade to restructure the Home to a multi-family home.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, the City of Hammond issued Andrade a second Notice of Violation on September 8, 2016, which provided that it should be reversed because the Home had the unsafe conditions of inadequate fire support beams, inadequate fire separation among the floors of the home, and inadequate basement apartment bedroom windows.  On January 4, 2017 Andrade served the City's Chief of Inspections Kelly Kearney with a subpoena to show that the original permitting of the Home did not meet the requirements of the federal building code. The City's response, which was denied by the court, was \"unreasonable\" and \"in excess of statutory authority.\"  The Court also denied Andrade's motion for a temporary restraining order, which he consented to, ordering the City to remove any additional apartments from the Home, and ordering the building to be re-inspected and partially demolished. The court also denied the city's request for a preliminary injunction, which the court entered on March 28, 2017.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Kollar and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. McGlynn. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Indiana Department of Insurance, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency."
