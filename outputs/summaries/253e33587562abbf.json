  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against Craig Dill, the trustee of Railyard Company, LLC, a New Mexico-based microcap company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Dill, in his capacity as trustee of the bankruptcy estate, failed to respond to the Commission's recommendation for a de novo review of the complaint.  Instead, the complaint alleges that Dill entered into an agreement with the Commission that, in its discretion, would permit the Commission to determine whether the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties should be imposed on the defendants.  The Commission's final judgment, which was entered on the same day, permanently enjoins Dill from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $75,000 in civil penalties.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the Commission issued a temporary restraining order, barring Dill from appearing before the Commission as a trustee, and ordering him to file a civil action against the Commission.  On March 24, 2018, the Honorable Steven C. Yarbrough of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the company's assets.  Without admitting or denying these allegations, the receiver has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the Federal Rules of Practice, ordering Dill to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and imposing a $50,000 civil penalty.  A hearing on the matter is scheduled for May 26, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 539 (January 29, 2018).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Complaint, filed under seal on January 29, 2017, charges Dill with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Section 15(b)(5) of The Exchange Act and Rules 15b-20, 15a-1, and 16a-11 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and penny stock and officer-and-director bars against Dill.
