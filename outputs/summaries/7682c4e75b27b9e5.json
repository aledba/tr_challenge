  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Antonio \"Tashawn\" Williams, a former felon who was convicted in 2016 of multiple counts of murder, felonious assault, and discharge of firearm on or near prohibited premises.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio on November 18, 2016, Williams was indicted for two counts of felony murder, one of which was related to a prior felony conviction.  The SEC alleges that Williams, who lives in the same neighborhood as Davis and his parents, was among the first to be charged with a felony for his role in a November 2016 shooting that left Demetrius Paul (\u201cvictim\u201d) seriously injured and his brother and sister-in-law shot at each other.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendant shot at the victim and the victim's brother, who was driving a blue Impala at the time of the shooting.  On the night of the alleged shooting, Williams allegedly confronted the victim, telling him that he \"don't deal around like that.\"  The complaint alleges that the victim was his best friend, with whom he would hang out daily.  Williams allegedly told the victim that he did not deal around with a gun and that he was going to die if he didn't have one.  He also allegedly threatened the victim with death in retaliation.  In a parallel criminal case, Williams pleaded guilty to one count of aiding and abetting a second-degree felony and was sentenced to 10 years to life in prison.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Williams consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a $1,000,000 officer-and-director bar.  Judge Williams also ordered Williams to pay a $500,000 civil penalty and ordered him to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for March 24, 2018.   The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Cuyahoga County Office of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio State Attorney General's Office, and the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation in this matter."
