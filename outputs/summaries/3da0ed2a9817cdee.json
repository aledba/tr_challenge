  "summary": "On June 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri entered a final judgment in favor of the Missouri Department of Corrections in a civil injunctive action brought by the Commission on Human Rights.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 7, 2016, Naugles, a paraplegic, was transferred to the Western Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Care Center in St. Joseph, Missouri, where he was incarcerated. The complaint alleged that, at the time of his transfer, the facility lacked handicap-accessible facilities for dining, worship, recreation, and education, and that Department officials ignored his requests to be transferred to a hospital wing of the facility.  The complaint further alleges that, prior to being transferred to St. Joe, he had not been able to exercise and participate in daily activities at other Department facilities.  As alleged in the complaint, after one hundred eighty days from the filing of a complaint alleging an unlawful discriminatory practice pursuant to section 213.070 of the federal and state anti-discrimination laws, the Commission has not completed its administrative processing and the person aggrieved so requests an answer from the court on the merits of the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia today announced that it filed criminal charges against the defendant in a related action.  On June 13, 2017, the court granted the Commission's request for a writ of mandamus, which is subject to court approval, and ordered the Commission to conduct an investigation of the matter. The Commission's investigation is being conducted by Scott Frost and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Missouri Attorney General's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 539 (Mo. App. W.D. 2013).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Frost, Ms. Gibson, and Ms. Fischer."
