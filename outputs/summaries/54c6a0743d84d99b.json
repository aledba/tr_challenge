  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was sentenced to prison for felony break-and-enter, malicious conduct by a prisoner, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.  The court found that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 15A-13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder.  In its judgment, the court held that the defendants violated the pre-judgmental provisions of the federal securities laws, and that the court had the duty to determine whether to impose a penalty based on the defendant's prior record level.  According to the court's order, the defendant agreed to be sentenced to 24 months in the misdemeanant confinement program on the basis of having 12 prior felony convictions, and to pay a penalty of 39 months.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 15(a) of the Exchange Act, and orders them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The court also granted the defendants the right to a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from destroying any evidence, including any evidence of a prior criminal conviction, and a court order requiring the defendants to provide a copy of the court order. The SEC's order also prohibits the defendants from using the internet to search for information about other people who have been convicted of felonies, including first- and second-degree murder, and from using social media to spread the word about their criminal history.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 556, 583 S.E.2d at 386-87.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Walter H. Godwin of the U. S. District court for the Southern District of New York issued a final Judgment against the defendants, ordering them to comply with the court\u2019s order, imposing a $25,000 civil penalty, and ordering the release of any other defendant with prior criminal convictions.
