  "summary": "On July 3, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Meadville Forging Company, L.P., a Pennsylvania-based forging company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court granted the debtors' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other relief.  According to the court's order, Meadville entered into forward contracts for electricity, which are contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. Meadville's contracts with suppliers of electricity, like its current contract with FES, contained a so-called \"transaction clause\" that permits a third party to enter into a forward contract without first acquiring the right to purchase or sell the electricity. The court also found that Meadville violated the automatic stay provision of Section 556 of the Exchange Act.  Meadville has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of North Carolina, charges Meadville with violating the anti-fraud provision and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson."
