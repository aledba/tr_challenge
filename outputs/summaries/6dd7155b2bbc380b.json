  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against Actavis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Actavis\"), a Minnesota-based pharmaceutical company, and its co-defendant, Martin T. Martin (\"Martin\") in a civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnesota on May 19, 2019, Martin and Actavis falsely claimed that Androderm, a testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) drug, was safe and effective for men with age-related hypogonadism.  The complaint further alleges that Martin failed to adequately disclose that he had developed a \"clot in his coronary vessel\" at the time of his heart attack.  Martin also allegedly failed to disclose that, in 2007, when he was first prescribed and subsequently began using the drug, he had a \"large sample-size\" coronary artery bypass surgery.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Dr. Ardehali, Gerstman, and Wells failed to mention that the TRT drug safety and efficacy had not been established, and that Martin had a history of cardiovascular problems.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Martin consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Minnesota Department of Health, and the Minnesota Office of Insurance Regulation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Minneapolis on May 24, 2018, alleging that Actavis violated the federal securities laws by failing to adequately inform investors of the risks and benefits of using the TrT drug. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the representations in the SEC\u00c2\u00a0investor\u00c2\u00a0advice and guidance, Actavis failed to inform investors that there was a significant risk of cardiovascular disease"
