  "summary": "On June 9, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland entered a final judgment against John Vigna, Jr., a former principal at a public school in Montgomery County, Maryland, that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Baltimore, alleges that, from at least 1992 through 2013, Mr.Vigna engaged in a pattern of misconduct in which he hugged and held a child in his lap while the rest of his students watched videos at the front of the classroom.  According to the complaint, he often hugged children, had them sit on his lap, and had his students sit on their lap.  In one instance, a school counselor told her that he had \"always had a soft spot in his heart for children.\"  The complaint further alleges that he frequently hugged children in his class, had their hands on his hips, and made inappropriate physical contact with them.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, this conduct was not consistent with the character of a person who had engaged in prior misconduct with children, and was therefore not admissible under Rule 5-404(a)(2)(A).  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court improperly excluded testimony about the nature of the alleged misconduct from the evidence presented to the jury.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendant has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, impose a civil penalty, and pay a $10,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0report\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0the accuracy of\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0statements\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0public opinion\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0find\u00c2\u00a0available on\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutional\u00c2\u00a0review\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0regardless of whether or not there is sufficient evidence to show that\u00c2\u00a0he acted in accordance with\u00c2\u00a0his\u00c2\u00a0character and\u00c2\u00a0practicing\u00a0perception\u00c2\u00a0with the children under his care.\u00c2\u00a0On\u00c2\u00a0September\u00c2\u00a017,\u00c2\u00a0"
