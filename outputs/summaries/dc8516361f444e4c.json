  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against June for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that, from 2010 through 2017, June was incarcerated and her mother, with whom she was living, was using drugs. According to the complaint, June confronted her mother about her drug use and told her mother that she would \"ask her mother to take care of M.C.\"  The complaint alleges that June agreed to the termination without admitting or denying the allegations of the court's order, and that she did not complete any of the requirements of her service plan. The complaint further alleges that after June was released from prison, her mother confronted her about drug use, and she confronted June about her mother's use of drugs.  June allegedly replied that she had seen her mother interact with the person who was a possible permanent placement.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against June.  On January 11, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against June, ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and imposing an officer-and-director bar against her.  Without admitting to the SEC's findings, June consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and orders her to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Fort Worth office by staff members of the agency's Office of Child Advocacy and Advocacy. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Attorney General's Office in this matter."
