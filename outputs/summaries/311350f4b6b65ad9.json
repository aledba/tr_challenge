  "summary": "On July 23, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan entered a final judgment against two defendants in a civil action brought by the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi, a sovereign Indian tribe located in Fulton, Michigan.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b)(5) of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, Spurr, a member of the tribe, engaged in a campaign of harassment that included, among other things, unwanted visits to Nathaniel\u2019s residence on the reservation and several hundred letters, emails, and phone calls.  Spurr alleges that the tribal court issued a temporary restraining order (PPO) against Spurr in February 2017, ordering Spurr to attend two hearings where she failed to show up, and ordering her to perform twenty-five hours of community service in lieu of the $250 payment.  Without admitting or denying Spurr's allegations, the court agreed with the court that the PPO was not a general waiver of sovereign immunity, and that it had no jurisdiction to issue a civil protection order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants, charging Spurr with violating the federal anti-fraud provision of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of that provision, as well as a civil penalty.  On August 2, 2019, a federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi issued a preliminary injunction against the two defendants, and issued an order suspending Spurr from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Michigan, charges Spurr and the other defendants with violating Section 13 of the Exchange Act, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  To learn more about tribal jurisdiction, see Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa, who will lead the litigation under the SEC's supervision. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
