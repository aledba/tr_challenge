  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced today that it has filed a civil injunctive action against a Florida man accused of defrauding his wife and two other women out of millions of dollars.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City on January 6, 2015, Emily R. and her mother, Ms. B. of Westchester County, Florida, Juan Antonio C. of Miami, Fla., claimed to be the father of Emily's child.  The complaint alleges that Mr. C., while otherwise engaged to take moral and financial responsibility for Emily, has been reluctant to take appropriate steps to finalize his legal status out of an honest legal and emotional concern about \"the other guy.\"  The SEC alleges that, in 2009, the mother and father filed a petition to vacate the Acknowledgment of Paternity, which was promptly filed with the court.  In 2010, the SEC filed a complaint against the father, alleging that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the father violated Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the father and mother consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  On February 13, 2015 the court granted the mother's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the father to appear in court for a paternity test.  At the same time, the court issued an order appointing an attorney to represent the father in a paternity proceeding, which is subject to court approval.  As a result of the court's order, Emily's father has been unable to show up for court-ordered paternity testing, and the mother has not had the opportunity to participate in any paternity proceedings since she was a teen.  To resolve the paternity issue, the U. S. Attorney for the Central District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Mr. R. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0reporting tool to identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that:  Emily's mother, who was never married, and her father, who were both convicted of murdering the mother, consented, without admitting, or denying, the existence of any paternity"
