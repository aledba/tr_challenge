  "summary": "On June 25, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against Steven Donziger, who is charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1782 of the United States Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on April 23, 2018 and unsealed on June 24, 2018 in the United Kingdom, DonZiger alleges that he was pressured by a group of Ecuadorian lawyers to submit falsified evidence in connection with the Ecuadorian judgment. The complaint alleges that the lawyers convinced one Ecuadorian judge to sign the judgment and then paid a Colorado consulting firm secretly to write all or most of the global expert's report, falsely presented the report as the work of the court-appointed and supposedly impartial expert, and told half-truths or worse to U. S. courts in attempts to prevent exposure of that and other wrongdoing.  The complaint further alleges that, in response to the court's order to hold him in contempt, the lawyers consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants agreed to a permanent injunction and to the issuance of an emergency court order. The court also granted the parties' motion for an emergency restraining order, which is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, on June 19, 2018 the United Nations General Assembly held a hearing on the merits of the case on whether to impose a partial asset freeze or a civil injunctive relief order.  On June 20, 2018 a federal district court in Manhattan entered an order granting the defendants an emergency asset freeze and ordering them to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, to pay civil penalties, to be deemed satisfied by a court-ordered injunction, and to pay a $500,000 civil penalty in the amount of $811,602.71. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Mr. Werner. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the British Columbia Office of Financial Regulation in this matter."
