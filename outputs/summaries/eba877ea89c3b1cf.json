  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana yesterday entered summary judgment in favor of Kathy Fillio for negligent entrustment in the care of her half-brother Dennis Slate.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Indianapolis, from August 2016 through August 2018, Fillio was in Florida and left her animals in charge of caring for her animals. As alleged in the complaint, a ram headbutted her, causing her to fall and break her arm or wrist.  The complaint alleges that Fillio knew that the ram had a propensity for aggressive aggressive behavior and that Slate had never warned her that a ram might be protective and territorial toward an animal which it perceived to be part of its herd.  As alleged, however, the complaint further alleges that as a matter of law Fillio had no reasonable care to guard against the ram because it had no visible horns.  In a parallel action, on August 29, 2018, the Indiana Court of Appeals granted summary judgment against Fillio on the basis of her failure to show cause and effect, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  On September 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the United States District Court in Indianapolis entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Fillio from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Fillio to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 524 (Ind. Ct. App. 2003).

The Complaint seeks a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 206, and a penalty of $1,000,000.  It also seeks an injunction against future violations"
