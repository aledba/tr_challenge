  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm or ammunition.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, on March 3, 2018, a San Diego man called 911 to report that he had witnessed two Hispanic men shoot at another car. According to the complaint, the caller described his observations of the shooting as well as statements describing what the caller observed from behind the wheel of his car. The complaint further alleges that the 911 call did not qualify under the present sense impression exception to the rule against hearsay because the caller was a disinterested observer, detached from any allegations of wrongdoing, and engaged in a series of verbal and physical confrontations with the driver of the Honda. In addition, the complaint alleges that while the 911 caller was observing the shooting, he was not able to corroborate every detail of the caller\u2019s statements. The SEC also alleges that Officer Braun corroborated several of the statements in short order further adds to the statements\u2019 reliability.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New York announced criminal charges against one of the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000. The court also ordered the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordered him to be barred from the securities industry. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 4, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L.
