  "summary": "On September 11, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance (DOF) in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that the Department of Finance improperly withheld or redacted documents related to a tax determination made by the agency.  According to the complaint, the department's response, which was subject to court approval, failed to comply with the Department's requests for the documents, including emails, draft agreements, a final closing agreement, draft correspondence and correspondence from and regarding the audit of petitioner's tax returns.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, by refusing to release the documents to the court, the Department violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Department from violating these provisions, and orders the Department to submit a privilege log and an affirmation by the RAO that it has failed to include in its response the recommendation set forth in the final determination. The court also granted the request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the release of any documents that are not subject to disclosure pursuant to the federal securities laws, and a civil injunctive proceeding against the Department.  On September 13, 2016, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered a judgment permanently enjoining the District of Columbia from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering the disclosure of documents that were exempt from disclosure, and ordering the department to provide a copy or a summary of the findings of the court's order. The order also ordered the Department not to violate the reporting provision of Section 206 of the Exchange Act, and ordered that the agency comply with all of the required provisions of the federal reporting laws, including, without limitation, with the issuance of a copy of the Commission's Final Judgment, which is subject to approval by the court. The Court also issued an order requiring the agency to provide an accounting of the amount of money spent on the audit. The Commission's order also requires that the department provide an explanation for why it has not provided that explanation.  Finally, the order requires the department not to release any of the documents it has withheld, including those that were deemed exempt pursuant to FOIL, and requires that it submit an affirmation of the reason for the denial of access to the documents.  As a result, the Commission issued a cease-and-desist order on September 12, 2016."
