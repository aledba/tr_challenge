  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California today entered a final judgment against defendant John Alves Santos in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Jose, Santos was arrested on February 28, 2017, in connection with a stolen vehicle report. The complaint alleges that at the time of his arrest, Santos had been living in poverty and was unable to afford to pay court operations and criminal conviction assessments. Santos allegedly told the court that he was indigent and unable to pay the fees and that he would wait for the court to impose the fines and fees. The court ultimately imposed a $1,800 restitution fine on Santos, which Santos agreed to pay without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. Santos also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the securities industry. The SEC also ordered Santos to pay a $100,000 civil penalty and a $150,000 criminal conviction assessment. Santos has consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay an $80 court operations assessment and $60 court conviction assessment without first determining Santos's ability to pay. The final judgment orders Santos to comply with the court's order.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Banking and Securities, and the California Secretary of State's Office."
