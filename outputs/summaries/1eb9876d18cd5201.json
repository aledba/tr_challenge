  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the organizations' motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against future violations of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1940.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that on November 9, 2018, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California issued an emergency order suspending the entry of illegal aliens into the U. States.  According to the complaint, the order temporarily enjoins the organizations from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions, and ordering them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In addition, the court granted the Organizations' request for an emergency court injunction, which is subject to court approval, and ordered them to provide a copy of the final order to the court.  On December 7, the Court granted the defendants' request to request a temporary injunction and ordered the issuance of a court order temporarily restraining the defendants from further violating the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c).  The court also granted the organizations the right to apply for an expedited court-ordered injunction against further violations of these provisions.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17 (a)(2) and Litigation Alert No. 206 (a) (b) (c) (1) (2) (3).  In a related matter, the SEC filed an emergency action on December 13, 2018 against the Defendants, charging them with violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 15(b)(2)(A) and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a temporary court order, and an order requiring the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively, to be determined by the court upon motion by the parties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper."
