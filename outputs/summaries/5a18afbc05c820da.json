  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania announced today that it has obtained a final judgment against a Pennsylvania man charged with distributing and possessing with intent to distribute heroin.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that Anthony Rowe was arrested on April 20, 2016, and charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. According to the complaint, Rowe consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to be barred from the securities industry for five years. Rowe agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. Rowe also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to a three-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any controlled substance. The court also agreed that Rowe must pay a civil penalty of ten years' imprisonment followed by five years' supervised release. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Department of Justice today announced criminal charges against Rowe arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint. The SEC also announced that it had obtained a court order freezing Rowe's assets, freezing his assets, and barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. In a related matter, the District Court today issued an order suspending Rowe from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Rowe, charging him with violating Section 841 of the Exchange Act, and with violating Sections 9(a)(1) and 9(b)(3) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"). The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and Joseph G. Sansone, Regional Director of the Philadelphia Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Office of Financial Regulation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
