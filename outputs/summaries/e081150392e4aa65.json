  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against a California-based attorney-in-fact who was not authorized to make health care decisions for the elderly.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Barbara Lovenstein and her niece, Robin Hutcheson, violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the SEC's judgment, which was entered on February 24, 2012, requires that a person who is not a party to a health care agreement or a personal care provider be admitted to a residential care facility without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In addition, the judgment requires that the person admitted to the facility be a \"health care provider\" under the federal health care provision, including providing care to elderly persons with disabilities, and that the attorney in-fact must be authorized to execute the judgment.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the exemption from the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(A) and 5(b)(5)(B).  The complaint also seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or prohibiting the person from acting as an attorney in the future, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, and an officer and director bar against each of the defendants.   In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the individual and entity responsible for the alleged violations of the anti-fraud provisions. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Health and Safety. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
