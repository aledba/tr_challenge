  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on March 25, 2020 entered a final judgment against Matthew Caniff, Jr., a convicted child pornography violator, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Caniff.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. John\u2019s County, Florida, Caniff sent a series of private, person-to-person text messages to a thirteen-year-old who asked him to send her a picture of her. The complaint alleges that Caniff replied, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, that he sent the message because he believed she was a \"princess\" who was role playing to be a \"child.\"  The complaint further alleges that, after Caniff pleaded guilty to the charges, he agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of five to 40 years. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas and Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Barry, and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Health and Human Services."
