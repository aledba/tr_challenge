  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Desmond Oluwaseyi Jackson on five counts of knowingly using a fake Federal Republic of Nigeria passport.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on May 19, 2018, Jackson was charged on five separate occasions with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC alleges that Jackson opened bank accounts in the names of David Ola Richman and Gibson Olarotimi Maxwell, and that, as alleged in the complaint, Jackson successfully opened accounts at Wells Fargo Bank, Chase Bank, Woodforest National Bank, and First National Bank (collectively, the \u201cRichman Accounts\u201d).  Jackson allegedly used a fake passport to open these accounts, which he falsely claimed were the result of a jointly undertaken criminal activity.  Jackson also allegedly used another counterfeit passport in the name of Gibson Ola Maxwell to open bank accounts at Chase Bank.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in one instance, Jackson opened accounts under the alias of Gibson Olara Maxwell and used another fake passport in a bid to gain her trust.  As alleged, Jackson also used a mailbox at a Postal Xpress store to wire money into the Richman Accounts.   The complaint alleges, however, that Jackson did not commit fraud on the front end and targeting victims, but rather targeted victims through e-mail or other electronic communications, assumed fake personas, and pretended to have romantic interest in the victims, and wired $389,252.79 of BEC proceeds to these accounts.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Jackson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of\u00c2\u00a027 months, and bars him from participating in any future penny stock offering or offering of penny stock.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.  Finally, Jackson agreed to a three-year supervised release, which is subject to court approval.  On February 26, 2019, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, ordered Jackson to surrender his passport, and ordered him to return to the United States to be registered as a broker of securities and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $32,950.00, a penalty of $1,038, and a $100,000 civil penalty.
