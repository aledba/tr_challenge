According to the court's order, the work being performed was a significant alteration to the hospital's air conditioning system because one of its two chillers had failed in the past, and the hospital was concerned that one chiller would not be sufficient in the warmer months to maintain the required temperatures.  The court found that the work was not simple, routine, or cosmetic, and that, like the work performed in Panek, it fundamentally altered the configuration or composition of the hospital buildings.
