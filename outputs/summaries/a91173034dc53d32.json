  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against two insurance carriers in a workers' compensation case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that Jeff Hulsey and Wall Farms, LLC (Wall Farms) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the Commission's finding that Mr.Hulsey failed to prove that he sustained a compensable injury on April 23, 2014, when he fell off a spray rig and twisted when he landed. The complaint further alleges that, after the initial injury, he sought medical treatment on August 14, 2014 when he was bush hogging, which resulted in back, hip, and leg pain that was much worse than before. The Commission also found that, on the basis of objective findings, Mr.hulsey was entitled to temporary total disability benefits, including medical benefits, from October 6, 2014 through November 6,2014.  In its judgment, the court found that the Commission failed to consider substantial evidence, including the fact that the claimant was incapacitated from earning wages on that date, and that he did not need to go to a doctor and did not require medical treatment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 18, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action against Wall Farms and its current insurance carrier, Riverport Insurance Company, charging them with violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and an officer and director bar.  A hearing on June 15, 2015, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. for the SEC to consider the merits of the SEC's case. The hearing was delayed until after the SEC examination that led to the determination of the final judgment was conducted by the SEC.  Among other things, the case was supervised by C.J. Burt of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Office of Inspector General, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson."
