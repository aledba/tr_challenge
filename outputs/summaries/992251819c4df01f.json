  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the trustee of the Armand Borel Trust, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1310 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that the trustee violated the fiduciary provisions of Sections 1310, subdivision (b) and 1310(c) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  According to the court's order, the trustee failed to show he was entitled to such relief because the trustee accepted the loan and deeded the property to the District.  In addition, the court found that, without the loan, the Trust could not maintain insurance on the property; the property could not be safely maintained; and there was a risk of foreclosure due to past due loan balances; and the Trust would be unable to take advantage of a negotiated reduction in legal fees that was contingent upon timely payment of the loan.

The court granted the District's request for a temporary restraining order against Corrie and Flanagan from further violating the securities laws and ordering the trustee to pay a $1,500,000 civil penalty and disgorge the remaining $800,000 loan with interest and pay the estate's estate taxes, debts, and expenses.  Last week, the District filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Manhattan, alleging that Borel violated Section 17200, and that Flanagan acted in excess of her express authority by entering into an option agreement that prohibited the District from acquiring or selling the Danville property. The District's complaint also alleged that Corrie negotiated the option agreement with Borel. The complaint alleges that, in disregard of the interests of the beneficiaries, Corrie"
