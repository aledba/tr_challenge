The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, N.Y., alleges that Jeffrey A. Wadsworth, Esq., a partner with Harter Secrest & Emery, gained extensive experience litigating constitutional, administrative, and immigration law cases, and that he was entitled to a $125 attorney's fee award based upon the number of hours he spent preparing the application.

Sansone entered a judgment ordering him to comply with the court's order that he pay a $150,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  At the same time, the SEC issued an order requiring the court to determine whether to impose a \"special factor\" exemption for certain of the defendants in connection with the litigation of a settled civil action, and to determine how to proceed with the payment of the civil penalty.
