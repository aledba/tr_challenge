  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the District Attorney's Office.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that, on January 24, 2017, the trial court granted summary judgment against two defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants previously sold their lake rights for $18,000.00 and sought to regain lake privileges for a portion of the property between their property and the lakefront.  Appellees' original claims were dismissed on summary judgment, and the defendants' counterclaims were filed in the alternative.  On the third day of trial, the court excused the defendants from participating in settlement negotiations and issued a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the securities laws and orders them to pay $2,568.50 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,000 each.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and provide for an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  To learn more about this matter, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2017."
