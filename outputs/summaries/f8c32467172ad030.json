  "summary": "On August 18, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri entered a final judgment in favor of a temporary worker's compensation award against a former employer.  According to the SEC's complaint, on December 7, 2015, Joseph Franklin was working on a scaffolding performing plaster work when, for unknown reasons, Franklin fell from the scaffolding and injured his head, neck, and back.  The complaint alleges that, despite how it was denominated, Franklin had no memory from the day of the accident and would not have used marijuana before work or at work.  In addition, as alleged in the complaint, Franklin's drug test was a qualitative study not a quantitative test and could not be used to determine whether the employer had liability for the employee's injuries.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's judgment, Franklin consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 287.495.1, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  On August 24, 2017, the SEC filed an emergency action against Franklin, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section\u00c2\u00a0287.495, and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay civil penalties of $250,000, and pay a $50,000 civil penalty to be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David Ahern, Christopher Long, and Paul Cary of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Hampton. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Missouri Department of Insurance. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
