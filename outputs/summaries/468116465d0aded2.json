  "summary": "On March 1, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment in favor of the housing authorities' motion for a writ of mandamus.  The court found that the entities involved in the litigation were not entitled to the housing allowance provided by the dissolution law.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Santa Rosa, California, the federal government provided the funds to construct and operate a $750,000 public housing development project in Montclair, Montclair and Santa Rosa.  As alleged in the complaint, these projects were not required to provide low- and moderate-income housing and were not eligible to receive the allowance.  In addition, the court found the housing authority ineligible for the allowance because it was not a part of the city or county.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the Housing Authority and the Department of Finance have agreed to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws and require them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their respective property taxes collected.  Additionally, the final judgment enjoins the city and county from violating Section 34167.10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 34170-1, 34167-2, and 34179-3 thereunder, and orders the city to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and the county to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  On March 2, the SEC filed an emergency action against the city, county, and municipal authorities in which it was alleged that they violated the anti-fraud provisions of the federal law, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, 13b-20, and 13b2-1 thereunder. The court also issued an order suspending the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any municipal bonds that may be deemed eligible for a housing allowance pursuant to the federal dissolution law, and ordering the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Werner. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.
