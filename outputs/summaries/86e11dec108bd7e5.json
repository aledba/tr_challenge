  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a mortgage fraud case.  The court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence and alleged Brady/Giglio violations following their convictions by jury of several offenses arising out of a mortgage-fraud conspiracy.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in federal district court in Winter Park, Florida, James Sotolongo, the finance director at Century Motors Financial, devised a scheme to take advantage of the rapidly-booming real-estate market by using straw buyers with good credit scores to obtain expensive residential real estate, which he planned to rent out for several years and then resell for a huge profit. The complaint alleges that the defendants submitted loan applications containing false statements, which four FDIC-insured banks relied upon in disbursing the loan funds. The SEC alleges that Rifai, who was not charged for his role as a coconspirator in the mortgage fraud scheme, submitted false testimony to the court. The court ruled that the false testimony did not meet the requirements of the federal securities laws, and that it improperly denied the defendants their motion to be re-joined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against two individuals who were convicted of securities fraud in connection with the scheme. The defendants have agreed to settle the charges against them by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the appointment of a receiver to oversee the closing of the case. The receiver has agreed to a five-year, $75,000 penalty. The final judgment against the receiver requires the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver. In addition, the receiver must show that he or she has the requisite background and experience to determine whether to consent to the issuance of a subpoena. The receivers also must show sufficient evidence to show that they are competent to comply with the court order.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1789 (January 26, 2019).
