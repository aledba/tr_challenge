  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maine announced today that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing criminal case against a Maine man accused of disseminating child pornography through the smartphone messaging application Kik.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Maine, alleges that, on January 5, 2017, Rusty Hood entered a conditional plea of guilty to the charge of transporting child pornography and reserved his right to appeal the District Court's denial of his motion to suppress.  According to the complaint, Hood agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 60 months' imprisonment followed by 10 years of supervised release.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hood consented to a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the federal securities laws, ordering him to comply with the court's order, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  Hood also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced criminal charges against Hood.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Hood, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Hood from accessing or using the internet without a court-issued warrant.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that Hood failed to disclose to the court that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in connection with his receipt of child pornography from his wireless telecommunications provider, Metrocast Cable, and Fairpoint Communications, Inc., and that Hood had provided the defendants with false and misleading information about the nature of the child pornography that he received through his use of the social media platform.  As a result of this conduct, Hood was subsequently sentenced to 60 months and a half of his supervised release, with the amount of restitution to be determined by the court at a later date.  Additionally, Hood's sentencing is scheduled for April 26, 2018.  To learn more about child pornography, see Litigation Release Order No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The complaint also charges Hood with violating the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of"
