  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Orbital Alliance Technologies, LLC, a Missouri-based company that manufactures and sells small-caliber rifle ammunition, and its owner, Lawrence C. Bass, Jr. (Bass).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Independence, Missouri, alleges that, on April 11, 2017, Bass and his wife, Phynice Kelley, were hired by Orbital ATK to manufacture and produce Tetrazene, a chemical compound used as a primer in the ammunition being produced. According to the complaint, Bass was scheduled to work in building #85, bay # 901 when an explosion occurred. The complaint alleges that Bass' job was to \u201cwedge\u201d the compound, and that he was not liable for the loss of his wife's life.  Bass' wife, M.B. and T.B., through their natural mother and next friend, were awarded worker's compensation benefits from the company.  The complaint further alleges that the company did not have the right and power to inspect the performance of its work and cease Orbital ATK work if necessary.  In addition, the complaint alleges the company was not required to hire permanent employees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, Orbital ATK and Bass consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the company to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The court also granted the company's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordered it to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2019, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Bass. The SEC previously granted the court's request for an emergency asset freeze against Bass, which was instituted in the wake of the Air Force's September 28, 2012, Air Force accident. The Court granted the request for the asset freeze and ordered Bass to surrender his passport, which he has not yet done.  To settle the case, Bass agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future violations, and the court will determine whether or not to order him to disgorge his gains with prejudgment interest, pay civil penalties of $150,000, and appoint a receiver to oversee the litigation.
