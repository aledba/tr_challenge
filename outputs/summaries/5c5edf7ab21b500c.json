  "summary": "On September 21, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas entered a final judgment against Twitter, Inc., a San Francisco-based microcap company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order freezing the assets of Twitter and other microcap companies.  According to the court's order, Twitter and its owner, dotStrategy, LLC, agreed to settle the case by agreeing to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Twitter.  Twitter has agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval. The SEC's order also prohibits the issuance of any cease-and-desist letter or other emergency relief, including an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver and ordering the receiver to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Twitter has consented to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a court order prohibiting it from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer. The court also issued an order temporarily freezing the company's assets and ordering it to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  On September 24, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint against Twitter and DotStrategy alleging that they violated the federal registration provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d)(2) and 13d-13 thereunder, and that Twitter violated the registration provision of Sections 1406(a) and 1404(c). The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction against further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, an order prohibiting the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, and, in the alternative, a civil injunctive proceeding against the defendants.  Additionally, the court has ordered the SEC to determine whether it is appropriate to transfer the case to a federal district court in which it will consider the merits of the action, and to determine the appropriate venue for the litigation.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1391 (b)(2).  The SEC encourages investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
