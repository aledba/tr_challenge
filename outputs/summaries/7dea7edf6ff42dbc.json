  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered final judgments in favor of the Township of Marple Township and against the developer of a Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on July 30, 2018, Realty Enterprises, LLC and its engineer James W. MacCombie raised the issue of whether or not the Township could legally construct a CCRC on their property.  The complaint alleges that the Township's failure to record the changes to the Map in October 2014 rendered the CCRC not in force until more than two years after the date of enactment.  Appellants also allege that the township failed to timely record the change in the Map.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Delaware today announced criminal charges against Appelants.  On May 12, 2014, the court entered a final judgment against the Township for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1502(a) of the First Class Township Ordinance and Rule 1502-B thereunder, and ordered the Township to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Township consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Township from violating these provisions, and orders the township to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Schlegelmilch. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Delaware County Office of Inspector General in this matter."
