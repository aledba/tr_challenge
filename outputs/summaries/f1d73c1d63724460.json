  "summary": "On May 25, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment finding that a former respiratory therapist at Mount Sinai Hospital Medical Center was unjustly terminated for misconduct related to her work.  According to the court's order, filed on July 29, 2017, the respiratory therapist was discharged for misconduct connected with her work, and thus, ineligible to receive unemployment insurance benefits.  The court also found that plaintiff had failed to comply with her employer's reasonable and lawful instruction to assist a patient in an emergency room.  As alleged in the order, plaintiff refused to perform her duties as instructed, including performing a procedure on a ventilator patient in the emergency room, and not providing therapist intervention when the patient was in respiratory distress.  In addition, the court found that defendant had violated the hospital's policies and procedures, and that she was not eligible for unemployment insurance because she did not follow the company's policy and procedures.  Additionally, the order found that Plaintiff had violated Section 602(A)(5) of the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1940, which requires employees to perform their duties as directed by their employer.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Plaintiff consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 17, 2018 the court entered an order requiring the SEC to determine whether a person who is discharged from employment for misconduct with a medical condition should be eligible to apply for unemployment benefits. The SEC's order also requires that the SEC provide a copy of the complaint to the Department of Employment Security, which is required by federal law.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (July 29, 2009).  The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendant.  Separately, the SEC is seeking an officer and director bar against each of the defendants.  A hearing on May 24, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. for a hearing on whether a disciplinary action should be instituted against the individual who was discharged from the hospital. The hearing was conducted in the absence of a hearing scheduled for that day. The complaint alleges that plaintiff failed to respond to a call from a doctor and nurse during the course of a procedure that required a patient to be suctioned. The patient's condition deteriorated, and the doctor confronted the nurse about it. The nurse confronted the doctor"
