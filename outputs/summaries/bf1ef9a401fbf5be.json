  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas on February 9, 2018, entered a final judgment against a convicted felon for tampering with evidence.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that, on Feb. 9, 2006, Willy R. Appellant, then a resident of Fort Worth, Tex., attempted to tamper with evidence in a routine traffic stop. The SEC alleges that Appettant attempted to conceal the evidence by hiding it under the seat of a patrol vehicle. The complaint further alleges that the defendant attempted to remove his right shoe and sock due to a medical issue with his toenail, and failed to show that the substance was presentable. The court also found that, contrary to the SEC's findings, Appellants was not guilty of the tampering-with-evidence charge and instead was sentenced to a double-enhanced felony range of punishment, with a five-year minimum sentence. The Court also found Appellat guilty of possession of a controlled substance with intent to impair its availability as evidence in an investigation, a third-degree felony. The case was investigated by the Office of the United States District Judge in Dallas and the case was supervised by Assistant Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Mr. Dunn and Ms. Elisha L. Frank. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in this matter."
