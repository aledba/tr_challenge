  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon for failing to show possible neglect of a criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Will County, Illinois, alleges that Kevin McGrath violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to disclose that McGrath was a former correctional officer at the Will County Adult Detention Facility. McGrath also allegedly claimed that a correctional officer from the facility where he was incarcerated worked on the defendant's \"POD,\" which he described as \"an aggressive, aggressive, and mentally ill inmate.\" McGrath allegedly told other inmates that he had engaged in \"several confrontations\" with another correctional officer, and that counsel assured McGrath that he would be impartial and would rather have the correctional officer on the jury than an attorney who was a State's Attorney. The complaint further alleges that the defendant did not mention McGrath by name in his three pro-trial filings, and never included his allegation that counsel had been ineffective in failing to investigate McGrath's mental health issues. The court also found that, by requesting a preliminary Krankel inquiry in his first direct appeal, McGrath failed to adequately address the issue of ineffectiveness that underlie his request for a new trial. In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against McGrath. The SEC also announced that it would conduct a preliminary examination of McGrath to determine whether he was fit to stand trial.  In a related matter, the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that, in its complaint filed in the United States District Court in the Eastern District of Michigan, the Court found that the defendants violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a)(1) and 5(c) thereunder of the federal securities laws. The Court also ruled that the jury selection process is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the securities laws, order them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties. The final judgments also order the defendants to pay disgorgement of $1,078,"
