  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Shawn Gorrell, a former insurance salesman based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who was convicted of three counts of wire fraud, two counts of tax evasion, and one count of tax-evasion.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that, from 2009 to 2012, Gorrell engaged in risky day trading through a personal E*Trade account.  According to the complaint, the SEC alleges that Gorrell commingled funds with his father's free tax preparation services for years before he switched to a new tax preparer who was ignorant of his business practices and personal finances and did not give him permission to use his funds in this manner.  In addition, the complaint alleges that from April 2011 to October 2012, when Gorrell began to pitch investments to dentists, he diverted investor funds to pay personal expenses and withdrew the investor funds.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and the SEC\u2019s investigation, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Gorrell from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The court also ordered Gorrell to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $2,500, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $150,000 in the amount of $20,000.  To settle the SEC case, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.  On the same day that the jury deliberated for a short period of time, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida announced criminal charges against Gorrell.  Among other things, the jury returned a general guilty verdict on each of the charged counts, finding Gorrell liable for a total of 17 felony counts, including one for tax evasion and one for aiding and abetting Gorrell's violations of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and ordering the SEC to conduct a conduct-based investigation that will determine whether Gorrell is liable to be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions.  For further information, see United States v. Covington, 998 F.2d 776 (10th Cir. 1993).  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorg"
