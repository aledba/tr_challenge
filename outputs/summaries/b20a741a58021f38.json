  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered final judgments against a defendant in a child custody case against him.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that, from at least October 2016 through June 2017, the defendant, B.J.L.J., engaged in a pattern of acting out of a desire to be with a parent.  According to the complaint, the father, who is on probation and on a drug and alcohol suspension, repeatedly told the agency that he would like to live with his children, but that he \"relies heavily on marijuana\" to help ease the pain associated with his disease, Charcot Marie Tooth Disease.  He also allegedly stated that he had difficulty understanding the children's wishes, and that he frequently called the children every Sunday evening, promptly at 6:00.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the father did not consistently visit the children, despite repeated requests from the agency to do so.  As a result of this conduct, the agency was unable to obtain permanent custody of the children for the time being.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Additionally, the court entered a final judgment against the defendant that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years.   The court also granted the agency's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, and orders the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court.  On June 6, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan entered final judgment ordering the defendant to comply with the court's orders, ordering him to return to Ohio and pay a $2,000 civil penalty, and imposing a $100,000 penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Department of Children and Family"
