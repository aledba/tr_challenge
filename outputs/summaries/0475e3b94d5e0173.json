  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New Hampshire today entered final judgments against Eversource Energy Resources, LLC (Eversource), a public utility company operating under New Hampshire law as an electric distribution company, and its owner-operator of a gas pipeline located in New Hampshire.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that, in 1996, the New Hampshire state legislature passed a law that required public utilities to acquire and operate gas-fired generation capacity.  According to the complaint, the legislature's intent was to \"harness\" the power of competitive markets and to \"protect\" customers from generation-related risks.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the legislature did not consider the \"functional separation\" principle in RSA 374-F:3, III, and that, as set forth in the federal law, the purpose of the restructuring was to reduce costs to consumers while maintaining safe and reliable electricity service with minimum adverse impacts on the environment.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in the amount of $1,000,000.   The settlements are subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Department of Energy, and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
