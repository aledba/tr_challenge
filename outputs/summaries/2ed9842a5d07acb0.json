  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas on February 28, 2019 entered a final judgment against a Kansas probation violator who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15 of the Kansas Constitution.  The court found that Teresa Gayle Hinnenkamp, a resident of Kansas City, Missouri, violated the federal and Kansas constitutions by failing to submit to random drug and alcohol testing as a condition of probation.  According to the court's order, Hinnengkamp failed to provide sufficient evidence to support her claim that the Kansas Department of Probation had not authorized suspicionless searches of probationers and parolees during the first year of her probation. The court also ruled that a warrantless search of a probationer's home does not violate the Fourth Amendment.  In its final judgment, the court held that the provision of the federal, state, and local constitutions that requires probation violators to provide reasonable expectation of privacy to their probationers violated the Fourth amendment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, the Court held that Hinnenhamp violated her rights as a probation officer and as a person under the supervision of a judge. The Court also found that, in the alternative, the provision requiring a probation violation to be met by a reasonable suspicion of drug or alcohol use violated the same Fourth Amendment provisions of the state constitutions, and that the court should not impose a search warrant on probationers or parole violators.  It also ordered the probation officer to conduct a \"reasonable suspicionless\" search of the probationers' home.  Hinnangkamp's complaint, filed in federal district court in Kansas, alleges that the Department of Justice improperly imposed the warrantless, suspicionless search requirement on her during her probation for a second time in 2017. The complaint also alleges that, based on her failure to comply with the mandatory conditions of probation, she has waived her right to a hearing to determine whether to issue a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  She has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the district court's records.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 2, 2020, the Honorable Kathleen L. Gibson of the United States District Court in Kansas issued an order appointing a receiver to conduct random drug-and-alcohol testing. The receiver will be supervised by a judge appointed by the court."
