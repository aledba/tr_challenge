  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Citizens Progressive Bank, LLC, Thad Kyle Investments, LLC and Commercial Capital Bank for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, alleges that, from 2008 through 2011, Citizens and Thad Aymond organized a number of business entities to conduct a farm operation in Franklin and Tensas Parish, Louisiana. The complaint alleges that the entities obtained and repaid a $4.7 million crop loan to KT and KT II, which they claimed was for the benefit of the Crop Loan. According to the complaint, this loan was not used in any way to pay debts associated with the 2012 crop loan. Rather, the complaint alleges, the loan was made solely to satisfy the requirements of the loan and did not require collateral to secure the loan. In addition, as alleged, the defendants failed to disclose to the court that the loan had not been paid in full, that the loans were not subject to any final judgment, and that the defendants had failed to provide sufficient evidence to show that they had breached the loan requirements. The court also denied Citizens's motion for summary judgment and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of $1,320,883.75 plus prejudgment interest of $250,000.00 and a civil penalty of $500,000, respectively.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Citizens, which was filed in the same court as the SEC's action against Commercial Capital, charging the defendants with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(3) of The Securities Act and Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-1 thereunder, and seeking a preliminary injunction against future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Citizens has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000 each. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 21, 2018, the court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order and ordered a hearing on the matter."
