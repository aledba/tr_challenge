  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan yesterday entered a preliminary injunction against Charles \"Chad\" Furstenau, Jr. and BTX Air Express of Detroit, a Connecticut-based logistics and supply chain management company, charging him with misappropriating trade secrets.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit on December 14, 2018, alleges that, from at least August 2018 through August 2018, Furstinau, a former Radiant employee, sent hundreds of emails to his personal computer, including one containing a list of employees who had left Radiant to join BTX Detroit.  According to the complaint, the emails, which were sent to a personal Comcast account, contained the names of the employees who were leaving Radiant.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the employees were not informed of their impending departure from Radiant, but instead were told that their departure was imminent.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the employees had been told not to use any of the trade secrets in their possession, and that they would simply \"drill down\" and \"let it go.\"  The complaint also alleges that Furstenauer had told BTX employees that he would use their confidential information to help them compete in the Detroit market.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Complaint or in the Court's Order of Final Judgment, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' motion for preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval, to the appointment of a receiver and to the issuance of an order appointing a receiver for the receiver.  Among other things, the SEC also granted the companies' request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from destroying any evidence or evidence of a potential violation of the federal securities laws, and to appoint a receiver to oversee the receiver and receiver of any stolen trade secret.
