  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana yesterday entered a final judgment against Sears Holding Corp. (\"Sears\"), a manufacturer and warehouse owner, for failing to pay for grain delivered to Cline Grain, Inc. (\"Cline\").  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, from 2009 to 2016, Dick Sears, a farmer from New Salem, Indiana, deposited corn and soybeans with a licensed grain buyer and warehouse. The complaint alleges that Sears was entitled to payment for the grain delivered before April 8, 2014, but was not entitled as a claimant for all grain delivered after that date. Sears also alleges that, in 2010, the IGBWLA denied Sears's claim for grain that had been delivered to the warehouse more than twelve months prior to the failure of Cline. The SEC's order, which was entered yesterday, permanently enjoins Sears from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Sears to pay a civil penalty of $97,927.52, which represents 13,295 bushels of corn and 6232 bushel of soybeans. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Sears.  The SEC is continuing its investigation, which is continuing to be conducted by the Office of Inspector General's Retail Strategy Task Force (OIGSF) and the Market Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Indiana Department of Commerce in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, the SEC encourages investors to \"check the background\" before investing in an investment by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to identify whether there are any significant conflicts of interest."
