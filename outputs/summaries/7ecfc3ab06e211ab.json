  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Texas-based liquor retailer Allstate, Inc. and three of its subsidiaries in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that the Texas Department of Commerce issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order temporarily halting the sale of liquor in Texas.  According to the complaint, Allstate and its subsidiaries raised the issue of whether Texas had a history of prohibiting out-of-state liquor retailers from opening retail liquor stores in the state. The complaint alleges that, contrary to the Texas statute, the Texas law imposes a burden on interstate commerce when it imposes a duty on interstate companies to obtain P permits.  In its judgment, the court found that Texas violated the dormant Commerce Clause of the federal securities laws. The court also found that the state violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being handled by Scott A. Mascianica of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter.
