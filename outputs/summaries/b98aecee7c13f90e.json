  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment in favor of Capitol Toyota, a California-based financial services company, in an invasion of privacy case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that, while working as an area sales manager for Toyota Motor Credit Corporation/Toyota Financial Services (TFS), TFS installed a global positioning system (GPS) tracking device onto the truck without plaintiff\u2019s knowledge or consent. When plaintiff discovered the GPS device on the truck, he filed a civil injunctive action against TFS, alleging that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC further alleges that TFS failed to inform plaintiff that it had installed the device and that it was not a search.  According to the SEC, TFS also failed to provide any evidence to support its claims that the device was a search and that the truck belonged to TFS and that plaintiff \u201cmerely had the right to free use of it under the Separation Agreement.\u201d  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that the defendants violated Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder, and that, as a result of TFS\u2019 violations of Section 9(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 17b2-1, the complaint seeks summary judgment, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000, and imposes a $25,000 civil penalty against each defendant, and orders TFS to pay a civil penalty of $50,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing on the SEC's motion for summary judgment has been scheduled for May 24, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Ms. Gibson is supervising the litigation."
