  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of Crown Capital Securities, L.P., a broker-dealer that had an interest in and operated each of the real estate investments the firm recommended to its customers.  According to the SEC's complaint, on November 10, 2008, DBSI, Inc. (\"DBSI\") and various subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy, and at least some of those investments became debtors in that bankruptcy proceeding.  The complaint alleges that Crown Capital failed to exercise due diligence in assessing the viability of the investments and failed to disclose that certain of the claims arose out of the same events as the disclosed claim.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that when Crown Capital applied for professional liability insurance, it disclosed one of the customer claims but not the facts that would support other potential customer claims arising out of investments through the same entity as that involved in the disclosed claims.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Crown Capital consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The judgment also orders Crown Capital to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  On March 25, 2011, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Crown Capital and ordered the company to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty.  Last week, the SEC filed a civil action against the company for its role in a Ponzi scheme that generated more than $600,000 in losses.  This case is being handled by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov."
