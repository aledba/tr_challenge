  "summary": "On July 1, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of first-degree murder for the April 1, 2010, shooting death of Washington Park, Illinois mayor John Thornton.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order halting the defendant's motion for a new trial.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on October 17, 2011, defendant Nortisha Ball and her sister, Laqueshia Jackson, were among the first to testify in a Krankel preliminary inquiry that was conducted in an adversarial manner. The complaint alleges that Ball and Lott told the jury that they saw a man exit the victim's car after it crashed into a tree and that he did not see the person exiting the car. The SEC alleges that, after the preliminary examination, Ball, Lott, and Davis agreed to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and order Davis to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the matter. Davis agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the imposition of a permanent injunction, and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the conduct of the preliminary inquiry. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Ball.  On July 24, 2018 in the Chicago Regional Office, the SEC filed an emergency action against Jackson, charging him with violating Section 17(a)(1) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder. The case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by John R. Roddis and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans."
