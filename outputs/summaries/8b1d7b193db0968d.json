  "summary": "On July 5, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman in an emergency action brought by the New York Attorney General's Office.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Schneiderman violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Schneiderman agreed, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to the entry of the final judgment that enjoins Schneiderman from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. The final judgment orders Schneiderman to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. Schneiderman has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a five-year conduct-based injunction. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In its order, Schneiderman issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct an independent review of the matter. The SEC previously issued an order requiring utilities to provide customers with information about the use of their customers' energy products, including whether they were charging customers more than they would have paid if they had just used a utility. The court's order also prohibits Schneiderman and his agency from imposing any price-reduction or other administrative rule. The order also requires that utilities provide information about customers who are eligible to participate in utility low-income assistance programs, such as whether they are members of a public agency, whether they receive federal funds, and whether they participate in any type of regulated program. In addition, the order requires utilities to guarantee to their customers that their bills would not be higher than if they purchased gas and electricity from the utility, and that the ESCOs would include energy-related value-added services or products that would reduce the customers' overall energy bills. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced parallel criminal charges against Schneiderman. The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Hershfang.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Office of the Secretary of State."
