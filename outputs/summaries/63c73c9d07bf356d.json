  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against M.A.P. Mechanical Contractors, Inc., a construction company, and its construction manager, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Midland, Michigan, alleges that, starting in 2008, the construction manager installed a boiler and related piping for the Mid-Michigan Medical Center.  According to the complaint, shortly after installing the boiler and piping, the boiler ultimately failed and needed to be replaced.  As alleged, the contractor's defective workmanship resulted in significant damage to concrete, steel, and the building's foundation.   The complaint further alleges that the contractor had not reported the problem to the court until March 2012, when the court granted the SEC's motion for summary disposition.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the construction company. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office and the litigation will be led by John Rymas.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Insurance, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, and other emergency relief agencies."
