  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the District Attorney's Office's motion for a temporary restraining order against a New Haven man accused of orchestrating a string of domestic violence.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Haven, Connecticut, alleges that, on May 25, 2013, an officer stopped a man in his patrol car in the middle of the night and asked him to identify himself. The complaint alleges that the officer followed the officer's instructions and, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, restrained the man from making any aggressive or aggressive statements to the officer, and then proceeded toward the scene of the alleged crime.  According to the SEC's order, the officer did not stop until the defendant indicated that he had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that he was going to engage in a criminal activity.  In addition, the court found that the defendant did not comply with the officers' requests for an officer to pat him down, and that he did not attempt to leave the scene.  As a result of this conduct, the complaint alleges, the defendant was not seized until Officer DeJesus stopped his patrol vehicle and asked the defendant's name, whether he had been hit by a car, or whether he was hiding in bushes or other dark places.   The court also found that, in the circumstances under which the officer stopped the defendant, he was not required to provide reasonable and reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant.  On the contrary, as set forth in the Complaint, DeJesus did not provide reasonable or reasonable suspicion at the time of the stop.  DeJesus' conduct was not consistent with reasonable or articulateable suspicion he had when he confronted the defendant in the parking lot of a public place.  He also allegedly did not respond to an officer's questions about the nature of the crime under investigation.  For example, the SEC alleges that DeJesus failed to adequately assess the safety of the officers in the area when he conducted his stop and patdown.  Further, the Court found that in the course of the investigation DeJesus violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the officer and the court agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 17(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 17a-3. The court further ruled that, based on the facts of the case, the arrest was not unreasonable and reasonable because the officer had reasonable suspicion of a reasonable person's involvement in the matter and the defendant had not engaged in any criminal activity while conducting his search.  Finally, the order against DeJesus permanently enjoins him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any penny"
