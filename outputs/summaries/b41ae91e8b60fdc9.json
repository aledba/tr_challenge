The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Michigan, alleges that Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to adequately consider the issues raised in the complaint.  According to the SEC's order, filed on July 24, 2019, the SEC alleges that, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, that the Commission is entitled to determine whether a person qualifies to serve on the Commission based on their First Amendment rights.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that Benson failed to consider the relevant First Amendment provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) and 5(b)(5) of that federal securities law.
