  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Des Moines, alleges that, in 2018, defendant Erin Macke entered an Alford plea to four counts of child endangerment pursuant to an alleged plea agreement she contends obligated the State to jointly recommend a deferred judgment and probation for Macke. The complaint further alleges that Macke failed to preserve error on her ineffective assistance of counsel claim because she failed to bring it in her direct appeal.  According to the complaint, Macke was sentenced to two years of probation and a two-year suspended prison sentence without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The SEC alleges that the defendants violated Section 814.6 of the federal securities laws, and the court agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins Macke from violating those provisions. The court also ordered Macke to pay a civil penalty of two years and a $1,000,000 civil penalty. Macke has agreed to settle the SEC's charges against her by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Macke arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge James L. Gibson of the Federal Bureau of Investigation entered an order granting the SEC a temporary restraining order, ordering the SEC to conduct an investigation, and ordering a hearing on June 20, 2019 to determine whether to issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the case. The hearing was conducted in the absence of a court order requiring a hearing. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Amy C. McKinley.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Iowa Department of Human Services, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the State Attorney General's Office, the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Division's Office of Compliance, the Public Finance Abuse Unit, the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit and the Iowa Office of Advocacy and Risk Management."
