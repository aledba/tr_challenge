  "summary": "On February 18, 2020, the Pennsylvania Board of Claims granted a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against a Pennsylvania company accused of defrauding investors in two publicly-accessible CNG fueling stations.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Pennsylvania, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Commonwealth), Department of Community and Economic Development's (Department), Commonwealth Financing Authority's (CFA), and CFA Executive Director Scott D. Dunkelburger's (DunkelBurger) preliminary objections to Petitioner's statement of claim (Claim) that the Commonwealth lacked jurisdiction to determine whether a publicly-owned CNG fuel station could be built on privately-owned land.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to the stated intent of the Commonwealth, the CFA did not have jurisdiction over the matter.  In its order granting the restraining order, the Secretary of State's Office (DOE) and Department of Commerce (DCF) issued preliminary and permanent injunctions against violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the DCE has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $34,440.00, a total of $547,047.00. The court also granted the company's request for a temporary asset freeze and a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 103 of the Procurement Code. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Gershfeld and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General in this matter."
