  "summary": "On January 21, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans entered a final judgment against defendant Horatio Johnson, Jr., who was convicted of second-degree murder and conspiracy to obstruct justice in connection with the murders of his cousin, Kenneth Joseph, and his wife, Lakeitha Joseph.  The court found Johnson guilty on all of the charges and ordered him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, Johnson and his friend, Amir \"Blue\" Ybarra, lured the victims to a recording studio where they recorded and sold their music. The complaint alleges that Johnson, who was then incarcerated on the same charges, used the recording studio to lure the victims into the studio, where the victims' bodies were dumped into the water.  Johnson allegedly spent the next two days searching for the victims, who were later found dead in their van.  In a parallel criminal case, Johnson was convicted on all four counts of second degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or a post-verdict judgment of the defendant's conviction.  On May 7, 2014, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Johnson and ordered Johnson to return to New Orleans and surrender his passport, which he had obtained from a convicted felon. The court also granted Johnson's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Johnson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $25,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, with the right to reapply after five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott Frost, Kelly Loomis, and Patrick McCluskey of the New Orleans Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Louisiana State Attorney General's Office, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Alabama Department of Justice, the Mississippi Department of Banking and Securities and the Louisiana Department of Health and Human Services."
