  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York today entered a final judgment against David Pirk, a Buffalo, N.Y.-based convicted felon, for orchestrating a series of high-profile murders in the Buffalo, New York area.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Buffalo, alleges that Pirk and his co-defendants, Filip Caruso, Paul Maue, Jack Wood, and Stanley Olejniczak, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants were among the first defendants to be convicted of a felony in connection with the murders.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in the days leading up to the trial, Pirk made numerous false statements to the jury, including that he \"saw Mr. Jenkins in the parking lot of Betty's Bar, the night of the murders.\"  The complaint further alleges that the defendants made numerous misrepresentations about the nature of the crime, including the fact that they had never been convicted of it, and that they did not know that the defendant had committed it.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties of up to five years.  On January 16, 2018, the court granted the Defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants' assets, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000. The court also granted the defendants the right to return their allegedly forged criminal convictions and to appoint a receiver to oversee the receiver's operations.  Finally, the Court issued an order suspending Pirk from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a trial defendant, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of five years, and imposing an officer-and-director bar. The order also ordered Pirk to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of the proceeds of the alleged crime.  Pirk has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the issuance of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future securities law violations.  He has also agreed to the appointment of a receiver and to the payment of a $10,000 civil penalty, which is subject to approval by the court.  To settle the charges, defendants agreed to pay"
