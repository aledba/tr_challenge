  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia today entered a final judgment in favor of the West Virginia Lottery and certain entities who were issued limited video lottery game terminals.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charleston, W.Va., alleges that the State Lottery violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the SEC alleges that, in violation of these provisions, the state Lottery did not waive its sovereign and qualified immunity defenses and instead relied on the insurance policy exception to sovereign immunity.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2012, IGT produced two protocols for the LVL terminals capable of communicating with the central computer system, and that in 2014, the company and its director told the Permit Holders that both the ICIS and SAS protocols could be used for the full ten-year permit period.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Defendants from violating the federal, state, and local securities laws, and orders the Defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for West Virginia announced criminal charges against the Defendants for their roles in the alleged violations of the securities laws and issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the property.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert C. Hannan of the U. S. District Judge's Office in Charleston issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Hannan and Hannan also agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as officers or directors of a public company.  Hanan further agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently barred from the securities industry and will be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 1, 2018).
