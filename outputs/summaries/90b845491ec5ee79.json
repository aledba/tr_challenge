  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against a California man accused of stealing a car worth $950 or less.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on August 7, 2014 while driving in Escondido, California, Ernest Orozco pleaded guilty to one felony count of receiving stolen property, which is a form of theft. The SEC alleges that he was the only occupant of the car when he received the stolen property.  According to the complaint, Orozcon consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 496(a) of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The final judgment, which was entered by the court on Dec. 11, 2014, finds that the amount of the civil penalty is not significant, and that the defendant is not eligible to be sentenced as a felon under section 496d. The court also found that, contrary to the SEC\u2019s opinion, the defendant was not eligible for a sentence reduction under the new law.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in favor of the defendants and against the relief sought by the district attorney and grand jury in the case.  On Dec. 13, 2019, the court entered a judgment against the defendants, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $950 and $1 million, respectively, for each of their violations of the anti-fraud provisions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants agreed to permanent injunctions, to be permanently enjoined from future violations, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about the SEC's investigation, see Investor.gov/Investor.gov."
