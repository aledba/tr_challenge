  "summary": "On January 23, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against four foreign defendants in a parallel criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Barclays Bank PLC, BNP Paribas Group, HSBC Bank, Ltd. and Standard Chartered Bank, Plc engaged in a conspiracy to manipulate benchmark interest rates in New York.  According to the complaint, from approximately 2007 to 2013, the defendants traded FX instruments at artificially inflated prices in order to pass on the anticompetitive overcharges to retail customers.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in coordinated trading in advance of the manipulation of the market, including in a chat room with traders from Citigroup and JPMorgan in which the traders discussed trading in anticipation of a client's market-moving transaction.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, these defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint and the court's order, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On January 24, 2020, the Honorable Judge Robert A. Currid granted the motion for summary judgment against the Foreign Defendants, which is pending final approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 26, 2020).  The Court granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the defendants' trading losses, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Mr. Karpel. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
