  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maine today entered a final judgment against Akeen Ocean and Jermaine Mitchell of Bangor, Maine, finding that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bangor on January 1, 2010, alleges that Ocean and Mitchell conspired to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 280 grams or more of cocaine base from New Haven, Connecticut to Bangor.  According to the complaint, Ocean, while on duty as an officer at the time of the alleged drug distribution conspiracy, purchased and sold crack from a paid informant at a Bangor jail.  He allegedly used the drug to feed his addiction and to support his own lifestyle.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Maine today announced criminal charges against Ocean, alleging that he aided and abetted his co-defendants' violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2)(A) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers\") and Rules 17a-1 and (2) thereunder, and that Ocean consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Ocean agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions, ordering him to be barred from the securities industry, and imposing a five-year officer-and-director bar.  Mitchell also agreed to pay $150,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 civil penalty.  Ocean also agreed not to participate in the sentencing of Mitchell.  On August 29, 2013, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against Ocean from participating in the alleged distribution of the drug, and ordered him to comply with the court's order barring him from appearing before the SEC as an attorney or practicing before the Commission on Securities and Exchange Commission (\"Commission\").  The court granted the request for a temporary restraining order, ordered Ocean to surrender his passport, and barred him from associating with any third party, and issued an order requiring him to provide a copy of the Commission's complaint to the Commission.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Philadelphia Regional Office and the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
