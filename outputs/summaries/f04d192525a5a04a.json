  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against One DC, a D.C.-based nonprofit, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, DC, alleges that One DC violated Rule 37(e)(1) by failing to preserve documents related to the Brookland Manor Apartments redevelopment project.  According to the complaint, one DC employee allegedly deleted e-mails from her work at the complex in anticipation of litigation.  One DC's complaint alleges that, as of July 28, 2016, Mrabet had deleted her e-mail account and that she ultimately decided to \"just delete the whole thing.\"  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, One DC consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court also issued a temporary restraining order, temporarily suspending Mrabet from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering One DC to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  On May 21, 2018, the Court granted a motion by One DC for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Rule 37e-1, and ordered the company to comply with the court's order by consenting to a permanent injunction.   The court also granted the company's request for a partial injunction, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
