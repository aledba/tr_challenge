  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against Anthony Terrell Booker, Jr., a Mississippi teenager who was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to life without eligibility for parole.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, on May 20, 2004, Booker was indicted for the capital murder of Dorian Johnson, age 52, and was separately tried for the same crime. The complaint alleges that Booker, then a sixteen-year-old, met Johnson at a park and began beating and kicking him. After the beating, the trio placed Johnson in the back of his Jeep and transported him to Vancleave, Louisiana, where the trio continued the beating and took Johnson's Jeep and wallet. The court found that Booker did not qualify to be re-sentenced. The SEC alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the mandatory life without parole provision of Section 99-19-101. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Booker consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of life imprisonment without parole. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Scott A. Mascianica of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mississippi Attorney General's Office, the United States Secret Service, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations Division, the Department of Justice Criminal Investigations, the Alabama Department of Banking and Securities and the Mississippi Office of the Secretary of State's Office."
