  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Bilal Sulieman, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 75 years in prison for orchestrating a mass shooting that left dozens of people injured.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on the evening of November 5, 2016, Suliemen was among the first victims of the mass shooting, and that he was the only witness to identify Luellen.  According to the complaint, the jury deliberated for nearly 30 minutes before Suliemann and his friends confronted him about his fear of the defendant and asked him to \"not discuss the case amongst yourselves or anyone else. Don't let anyone discuss it with you.\"  The court ultimately agreed to the final judgment, which permanently restrains the jury's right to a fair trial.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Suliman.   The complaint also alleges that the trial court violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court has agreed to a permanent injunction and to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $75,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Office of Inspector General, and the Illinois Department of Justice in this matter."
