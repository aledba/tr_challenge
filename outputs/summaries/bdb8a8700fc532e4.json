  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the New York City Police Department, ordering the release of over 700 pages of internal department disciplinary records.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that the Department of Justice improperly withheld the records of officers who had been charged with misconduct or disciplinary violations.  According to the complaint, the department improperly withheld these records in order to protect the officer's identity and to give the officer the opportunity to present his or her story to the court.  In its order, the court found that the department violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the department to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the NYPD consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the officers' salaries and benefits. The court also granted the department's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the disclosure of the requested records, and granted the request for an officer-to-officer conduct-based injunction. The order also prohibits the issuance of any civil injunctive relief, including an order requiring the officer to provide a copy of the disciplinary order to a court-appointed receiver, and requires the agency to notify the subject officers of the pending litigation.  Finally, the order requires the NYPD to inform the subject officer that it has obtained a court order directing it to provide the requested personnel records to the receiver.  As a result, the complaint alleges, the agency has been unable to obtain an order to release the records without violating the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933, and the court granted the complaint's motion for leave to appeal. The complaint also alleges that, in a parallel action, the New Jersey Attorney General's Office filed an emergency action in which it obtained an emergency court order to freeze the officer-issued records of at least 700 officers. The SEC also obtained an order appointing a receiver to secure the records and to issue them to the public as part of an ongoing criminal investigation.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph P. Hoey of the Court of Appeals granted the SEC request for access to the records in connection with a pending criminal case against a former officer of the department.
