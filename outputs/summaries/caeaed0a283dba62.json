  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, alleges that Husband violated Section 5 of the Protection From Abuse Act of 1940 (\"PFA\") by failing to adequately consider the risk of abuse posed to the child as well as the credibility of the parties' relationship. The complaint further alleges that the court improperly granted Husband temporary custody in a PFA order without considering the child's best interests. The court's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins Husband from violating Section 5 and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The final judgment orders Husband to comply with the court's orders. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 5, the PFA Act, and Rule 5b2-1, and an order appointing a temporary director of the Department of Justice's Office of Child and Family Education.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Husband. The case was investigated by the Philadelphia Regional Office, which conducted a case-by-case review of the case. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by C.J.B. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
