  "summary": "On March 14, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California entered a temporary restraining order (TRO) against the City of Montebello for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court granted the TRO order on March 19, 2019.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, California, Katherine Weaver has located an \"appropriate site\" for her tattoo studio to open up shop on Beverly Boulevard.  As alleged in the complaint, the proposed location is within 1,000 feet of certain \"sensitive uses,\" such as residences, schools, libraries, public parks, and public parks.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the proposed site has sufficient access to streets and highways, and is adequate in width and pavement type to carry the quantity and quality of traffic generated by the proposed use.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Ms. Weaver has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and requires her to surrender her passport.  On March 24, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered an order enjoining her from future violations of the securities laws and ordering her to comply with the court's order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Weber. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Los Angeles Office of Inspector General, and the California Office of the Inspector General in this matter."
