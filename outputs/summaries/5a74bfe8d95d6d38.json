The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that defendant Yoon Chul Shin was illegally seized by the Stamford Police Department on August 10, 2016. The complaint alleges that the defendant told the officers that he was in the process of desecrating Jewish temples and that he had a cordial relationship with a rabbi at his New Jersey temple. According to the complaint, however, the defendant was not on trial for the alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court improperly imposed a three-year conditional discharge on the defendant.
