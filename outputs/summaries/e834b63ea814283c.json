  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against a Kentucky-based emergency medical technician who allegedly suffered a severe neck and left shoulder injury while lifting a patient.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bowling Green, Ky., alleges that, on September 14, 2014, while working as an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) at the local sheriff's office, Mullins suffered a serious shoulder injury.  According to the complaint, while on top of the camper, he experienced severe neck pain, which he described as \"harmful.\"  The complaint further alleges that Mullins was put on a stretcher reaching across the patient and developed sudden pain in the left shoulder and left upper extremity.  In a judgment that permanently restrains the award of PTD income benefits to Mullins, the court found Mullins had suffered a compensable work-related shoulder injury but denied liability for any other injury or condition.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Judge granted the motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered Mullins to comply with the court's order.  On October 2, 2018, the Court granted the request for a permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and granted the appointment of a receiver to determine whether to issue an order suspending or issuing an order requiring the receiver to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver.  A hearing on October 4, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Aug. 24, 2018).  The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kentucky Department of Insurance, and the Kentucky State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
