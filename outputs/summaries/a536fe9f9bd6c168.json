  "summary": "On January 12, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah entered a final judgment in favor of Deidre Sue Janson in her civil action against Jeffrey Alan Janson.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, Janson filed a civil injunctive action against the district court on January 12 for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that the court improperly set aside the Stipulation on the basis that it was inconsistent with the principle that retirement funds should be distributed equally between the parties.  Janson also alleges that, contrary to the court\u2019s order, she agreed to pay Jeffrey $13,178 from her share of the parties\u2019 bank accounts to equalize the amount of her premarital equity in the home.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Janssen consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $15,281.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Utah today announced criminal charges against Janson for his role in the Janson case.  On January 9, 2018, the court granted Janson a temporary restraining order, which prohibits Janson from raising his or her claims in the future, and ordered him to pay disgorgement of $45,000 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and to pay civil penalties of $3,500 and $11,500, respectively.  To settle the case, the SEC also issued an order requiring the court to consider the merits of Janson's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering a hearing on January 13, 2018 and ordering a preliminary examination of the settlement.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Office of Financial Regulation, the Utah Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Utah Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
