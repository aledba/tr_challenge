  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil rights action brought by two other defendants.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, in August 2016, Nelson Arce was placed on probation in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.  According to the complaint, the probation officer knew that Nelson required a qualified American Sign Language interpreter to effectively communicate, but did not provide such an interpreter to facilitate Nelson's meetings with the probation officers.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand, in his official capacity as the Sheriff of Louisiana, never provided Nelson with a reasonable attorney's fee.  Instead, the SEC alleges that Arce sought nominal damages in recognition that he had sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury as a result of the challenged \"conduct\" of either defendant.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Arce consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $2 million in disgorgement, $1 million in prejudgment interest, and a $32,373.08 civil penalty.  Judge Buckhannon agreed to the final judgment without prejudice, ordering Arce to pay a civil penalty of $500,000, ordering him to disgorge $1.5 million in fees, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against Arce.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 565, 566, (Jan. 18, 2015).  The U.N.
