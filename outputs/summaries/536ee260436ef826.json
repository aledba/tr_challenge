  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered final judgments against a defendant who has agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, on New Year\u2019s Day 2012, the defendant and his longtime girlfriend, Kathleen Baxter, were in a cycle of verbal abuse, physical abuse, separation and reconciliation. According to the complaint, Ms. Baxter had just reconciled and decided to go on a trip to downtown Atlanta when she and appellant became violent with him after consuming alcohol. The complaint further alleges that the defendant was verbally and physically abusive to the two women when he drank, including repeatedly hitting them in the face, breaking their nose, and putting his finger \"up [her] butt.\" The complaint also alleges that one of the women also told the SEC that appellant used his fingers to touch her anus against her will, conduct which was similar to what she did to her friend. The SEC alleges that this conduct was consistent with the pattern of prior difficulties between appellant and Ms.axter in which he had a pattern of verbal and physical abuse. In addition, the complaint alleges that when appellant was drunk, he would sometimes roughly force his fingers up her anus despite her begging him not to do so.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney\u2018s Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On October 21, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against appellant, charging him with violating Rule 404 of the federal securities laws, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Mr. McWilliams consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018."
