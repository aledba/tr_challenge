  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment against Portland General Electric Company (PGE) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b)(7) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that PGE violated Section 1365 of the Exchange Act by failing to comply with certain requirements of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, PGE and the Tribe have agreed to settle the case by agreeing to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  PGE has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against PGE.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 13(a)(2) and 13(c) and ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The judgment also orders PGE to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount that the Tribe and PGE have already paid in the civil penalty.  Additionally, the court granted the Tribe's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits PGE from participating in any future citizen suit, and ordered the Tribe to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in the amount of $75,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On June 21, 2005, the Honorable Rebecca M. Welshhans entered a judgment granting the Tribe a permanent injunction against future violations, ordering the Tribe not to participate in future citizen suits, and ordering PGE not to pay any civil penalty for any individual or entity that is alleged to be in violation of the CWA. The court also granted the tribe's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Rule 13a-14, ordering it to pay civil penalties of $150,000 each, and imposing a $50,000 bar on PGE, which the Tribe has agreed to pay in a separate civil action. The order also prohibits the Tribe from associating with any person who is not a member of a recognized tribe or a recognized federal agency, and from representing the Tribe as a party to any citizen suit. The Court's order also provides for the Tribe"
