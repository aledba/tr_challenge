  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of J.K. Javorski, a Delaware Limited Partnership, against Sanofi-Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Sanofi subsidiary, and its subsidiary, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that JKJ and its partners misrepresented Plavix's effectiveness for certain patients, including those who were genetically predisposed to experience diminished or no responsiveness to the drug.  According to the complaint, the defendants also failed to disclose to the public that the drug was not effective for all patients.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to adequately disclose the genetic variability of response that some of the patients experienced in the first amendment of the Exchange Act, and failed to inform the public of this fact.  As a result, the Complaint alleges that, in certain patient populations, defendants were able to proceed as a party to litigation even though they knew it was false and misleading.  For example, in the second amendment, the court found that defendants had violated the pre-clearance provision of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15a-1, and that defendants were liable as a result of their failure to comply with that provision.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of up to $100,000.  Additionally, the Court found that the Defendants violated Rule 15A-1 by failing to disclose material adverse event and risk information contained in the Commission's First-to-file Complaint, which is subject to Rule 15(b)(5).  The Court also found that, as a matter of law, defendants violated Section 15A, which requires the Commission to determine whether a person is entitled to a penny stock bar based on his or her knowledge of the alleged fraud, and to require that the Commission consider the merits of the complaint before it can issue a judgment imposing such a bar.   The Complaint also alleges that defendants violated the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of The Exchange Act and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and Section 9(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0The Exchange Act.  Defendants have agreed to settle the Commission"
