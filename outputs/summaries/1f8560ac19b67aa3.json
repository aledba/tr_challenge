  "summary": "On September 5, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia entered a temporary restraining order against Heather M. and Richard R. from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Kanawha County, WV, Heather raised the issue of supervised visitation with her two children, A.R. and E.R., by claiming that Richard had been verbally and physically abusive to her and the children.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the two children were never married, and the family court refused to allocate the dependent child tax exemption for both children to Richard.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for West Virginia today announced criminal charges against Heather for her role in the alleged abuse and neglect.  On September 6, 2019, the court granted Heather's request for supervised visitation and ordered her to return to their joint home so that she could attend therapy sessions.  At the time of the hearing, Heather had been in counseling for about a year, and her counsel had subpoenaed a counselor to present evidence of Richard's alleged abuse.  As alleged in the complaint, Heather was unemployed and unable to supervise her children, so she requested that the court allocate the child tax credit for both of the children to her.  Heather's amended petition, filed on September 7, 2018 and unsealed on September 9, 2018 in the Umpqua County Court of Appeals, charges Heather with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Heather consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions, and orders her to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer and director bar.  She also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney in the future.    The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of people selling investments by\u00c2\u00a0using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0"
