  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against ACE American Insurance Company (ACE), a Massachusetts-based reinsurance company, for failing to pay benefits to an injured employee.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that ACE violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that, in violation of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, ACE violated Rule 15a-3 thereunder.  In its judgment, the court found that ACE was not liable to pay compensation to the injured employee and that the trust fund had no obligation to pay the employee's benefits until it was insolvent.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, ACE agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins the company from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $400,000.  ACE also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to pay an officer and director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David C. Wells and Carol A. Spaniol of the Boston Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Division of Insurance's Office of Risk Analysis and Analysis, and is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Wells, and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans and Glenn S. Gordon.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 565 (2)(c).
