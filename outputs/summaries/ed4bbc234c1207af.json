  "summary": "On September 30, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil action brought by the landlord-tenant trust against him.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, the defendants failed to adequately consider the issues raised in the complaint, and the court ultimately denied the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the defendants to pay attorney's fees and costs.  In a parallel action, the court issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order suspending the defendants from engaging in any action that arose under the common law.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and permanently restrains and enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws.  Finally, defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.  As a result, defendants will be barred from seeking or recovering fees from the defendants.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 10-cv-1021, -1039, -529, 11-CV-1111, and 12-AA-1656 (D.C. 2007).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Housing and Urban Development."
