  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of HSBC Bank USA, N.A., a California-based bank, against Stanley P. Berman, a record owner of the property located at 15342 Carrie Drive, Grass Valley, California, who defaulted on his home mortgage and a trustee's sale was denied. According to the SEC's complaint, Berman filed a second amended complaint on September 18, 2014, alleging that HSBC violated the antifraud provisions of Section 2923.6 of the federal securities laws. The SEC alleges that, contrary to these representations, Berman was not entitled to injunctive relief because he had not yet filed an appeal from the September 2014 denial of his application for a loan modification. Instead, the complaint alleges that in his amended complaint, HSBC misrepresented to the court that Berman had until October 2, 2014 to file an appeal of the denial letter. The complaint also alleges that Berman did not file an application to the trustee\u2019s sale until the court determined that a material violation of that provision had been corrected. In addition, as alleged in the SEC complaint, the SEC found no merit in any of the defendants\u2019 alternate arguments for affirming the trial court. In fact, the defendants agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the California Department of Banking and Securities and Investments."
