  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of two felony counts of family violence assault.  The SEC's complaint, filed on August 10, 2016, alleges that Elbert Jones, III, of Callaway, Missouri, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Jones was the source for synthetic marijuana, and he entered into an intimate relationship and began living together for about a year. The complaint alleges that, in addition to squeezing her throat so hard that she could barely breathe, appellant hit her in the face and head and fled the scene when someone came around the corner and confronted her. The SEC alleges that the trial court improperly admitted State\u2019s Exhibit 7 during the punishment phase of the trial because it did not properly authenticated the exhibit.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Central District of Texas today announced criminal charges against Jones.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, Texas, the defendants agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  On November 24, 2013, the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial, which is subject to court approval, and ordered Jones to pay a civil penalty of thirty years in prison. The court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000. The defendants also consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay restitution in amounts to be determined by a court at a later date upon motion by the SEC. The final judgment orders Jones to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and orders him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The judgment also requires him to pay an officer-and-director bar and a $10,000 civil penalty. The trial court also has agreed to a $25,000 bar and to a five-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of imprisonment. The settlements are subject to Court approval."
