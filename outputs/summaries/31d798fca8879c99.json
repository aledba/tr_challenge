  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a preliminary injunction against two California-based companies for allegedly violating the federal trademark registration provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that, since at least July 2017, defendants have been selling recreational marijuana and vaping devices in the marketplace.  According to the complaint, Defendants' use of the WOODSTOCK mark in connection with the sale of recreational marijuana, which the complaint alleges is illegal under federal law, is inconsistent with Defendants' claims that their mark is uniquely distinctive.  For example, the SEC alleges that defendants used the mark on \"smokers' articles\" and \"cigarette cases,\" and that, in reality, defendants' mark is not distinctive at all.  In addition, as alleged, Defendants have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on their trademark infringement claims, because they are not registered as a manufacturer of the mark.  As a result, Defendants are prohibited from using the mark in association with recreational marijuana or vaping devices.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders a temporary restraining order.  On May 8, 2019, the Honorable Robert W. Sweet of the United States District Court in Manhattan entered a final injunction against the defendants, ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  Separately, the court granted the SEC request for an emergency asset freeze and an officer-and-director bar, and ordered the defendants to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court on June 11, 2019.  To learn more about trademark registration, see Litigation Release No. 5,612,311 (Dkt. No. 91-1) and Litigation Alert No. 17-cv-01221 (SDN.Y. 1997).  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Intellectual Property and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0order\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0instant.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the potential for confusion in the market for recreational marijuana."
