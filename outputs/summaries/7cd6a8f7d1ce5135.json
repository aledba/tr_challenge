  "summary": "On May 1, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas entered a final judgment against the Bloomfield Debtors, the Preferred Care Debtors and the Management Debtors for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 362(b)(4) of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Santa Fe County, New Mexico, the Bloomfields Debtors chronically understaffed their nursing facilities, thereby failing to deliver the basic care services they were paid to provide.  The court also ruled that the defendants were not subject to the pre-judgment authority to impose an automatic stay.  In a parallel action, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order on May 1 that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the anti-fraud and anti-dealing provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of federal securities law, and orders the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of $50,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil monetary penalty for each of the defendants' violations of the securities laws, as well as an officer-and-director bar against the defendants.  On May 2, the court granted the request for an emergency court injunction, which is subject to court approval, and granted the parties' motion for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the amount of their allegedly ill-gotten gains with respect to the alleged misappropriation of funds.   The Court also granted the defendants the right to apply for a preliminary injunction and to issue an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's receivership. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, a civil penalties, and injunctive relief.

The case is being supervised by Gregory A. Kasper.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Mexico State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
