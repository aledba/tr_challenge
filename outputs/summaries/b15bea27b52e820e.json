  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was barred as a matter of law from introducing evidence of the victim's subsequent convictions for crimes of violence as evidence that the victim initiated the confrontation with the defendant when the conduct giving rise to the defendant's convictions occurred subsequent to the charged incident. The court also found that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court further found that, contrary to the defendants' representations to the court, the defendant was not permitted to introduce evidence of any of the victims' subsequent convictions as evidence of self-defense when, in fact, he was the initial aggressor during the incident.  In addition, the court found that defendants were not entitled to a new trial on the basis of their prior convictions.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Connecticut, from August 2011 through March 2013, the defendants engaged in a verbal exchange with a neighbor in which the victim described a \"jealousy\" of White and other men. The complaint further alleged that, in the course of the exchange, the victim raised the issue of whether a subsequent conviction should be admitted, citing the similarity in motive for the conduct.  As a result of this conduct, the complaint alleges that the defendants were inadmissible as a part of a pattern of misconduct that led to their subsequent convictions, and that the victims were the aggressors.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requiring the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David M. Cohen and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Cohen, Ms. Gibson, and Mr. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Department of Criminal Justice."
