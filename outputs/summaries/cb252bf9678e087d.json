  "summary": "On September 15, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Harbour Mechanical Corp. (\"Harbour\"), a contractor that the property owner retained to convert its building from a gas heating system to a Con Ed \"clean steam station,\" against Harbour.  The court found that Harbour, while working on the project, caused, created, or caused an opening in the floor of the pump room that was exposed by its removal of an oil tank.  According to the court's order, Harbour did not take any remedial steps to prevent the opening from opening, and instead simply removed the tank and left the opening exposed.  Harbour also allegedly did not remove the tank before it was removed, and did not place cones or barricades in the vicinity of the opening.  In addition, the court ruled that Harbour failed to adequately protect the opening when it removed the oil tank, and that it did not negligently cause, create or exacerbate a dangerous condition.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, Harbour agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000, which Harbour has already agreed to. The court also granted Harbour's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits Harbour from violating these provisions, and ordered Harbour to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $15,000 and $1,500, respectively.  On September 21, 2017, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Donnelly of the New York District Court entered a judgment granting Harbour's motion for summary judgment against it, ordering a permanent injunction against Harbour, and ordering the company to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, and imposing an officer-and-director bar.  A hearing on September 24, 2018, was scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Ellen Coin. The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the SEC's New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Securities."
