  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment ordering the Maryland Secretary of State's Office to pay interest on two refunds of sales taxes for which the taxpayer was not entitled.  According to the SEC's complaint, Jason Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"JPI\"), a research and engineering firm based in Owings Mills, Maryland, and its former tax director, Gabriel Massuda, filed a refund claim with the Maryland Office of Revenue in August 2011 seeking a total refund of $332,365 in sales tax overpayments for the preceding four years.  The complaint alleges that JPI paid the tax despite knowing that the Comptroller's Office had applied a different exemption for the same reason.  JPI's receipt of the tax, however, was unrelated to the fact that the tax was due at the time it was paid, and therefore the amount of the refund owed was not determined by the tax court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Maryland today announced criminal charges against JPI.  On May 23, 2013, the Court of Appeals in Baltimore issued a final determination, ordering JPI to pay $22,863 in interest on the refund, ordering the company to pay a total of $323,829, and ordering the payment of a $33,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, JPI consented to the final judgment, which permanently enjoins JPI from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,038,768, and a civil penalty of $32,000.  Additionally, the court granted JPI a temporary restraining order and ordered the company's return to be processed by the Office of Inspector General.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry in the Baltimore Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Maryland Department of Revenue, the Office's Office of Compliance, and the Maryland State Auditor's Office in this matter."
