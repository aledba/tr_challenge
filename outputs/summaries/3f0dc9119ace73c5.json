  "summary": "On August 2, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against a Texas-based news organization and its owner in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that the Texas Corporation Commission (TCPC) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in making his document requests, Dolcefino failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the TCPC applied to his requests and that he was entitled to dismissal and related attorney's fees and costs.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office charged CCEMS with failing to produce a financial record pursuant to its declaratory judgment.  According to the complaint, the TCPA does not apply to any non-profit corporation, including a right to free speech, right to association, or any other action protected by the federal securities laws, and that the complaint was filed in response to the Commission\u2019s subpoena for documents.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, CCEMS consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the provisions of the Commission Act and orders it to pay civil penalties in the amount of $27.003 per day, $1,000 in disgorgement, $2,500 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Dallas Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Department of Public Safety, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
