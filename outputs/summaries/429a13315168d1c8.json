  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against Atlanta-based attorney Gus McDonald for legal malpractice, among other things.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in 2010, McDonald, as the company\u2019s CEO, provided legal advice concerning the sale of a business that Stewart and Stewart jointly owned, to a group of Texas investors.  According to the complaint, McDonald provided expert opinion testimony to show that he was not a lawyer and that he did not represent Stewart in the transaction.  In addition, the SEC alleges that McDonald provided material non-representative evidence to support his claim that, as a result of the sale, he was entitled to 49 percent of the total proceeds of the company, not just the cash amount he was to be paid as he had been in the past, with free athletic training sessions for his son.  McDonald also provided evidence that he had helped Stewart reduce to paper a sale that the two had already negotiated with the company's buyer.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, McDonald did not act as Stewart's lawyer and instead acted as an intermediary between parties who had often conflicting interests and did not cause any of Stewart's alleged damages.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, McDonald consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $735,000, prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the judgment orders McDonald to pay a $500,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar, and to pay an attorney fee of $1,500, which Stewart has agreed to pay in a separate administrative proceeding.  On the same day, the court granted McDonald's motion for a directed verdict on all of his other claims, including that he failed to present evidence that McDonald had breached his duty of care to Stewart.   The court also granted McDonald an attorney-client bar, which requires a jury to determine whether a defendant has a duty of duty to a jury.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 543 (2) (A&L) (B. David Fraser, Inc., March 22, 2013).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, David A. Kasper, and Amy S. Cotter of the Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney\u2018s Office for the Eastern District of Georgia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Department of Banking and Securities."
