  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of two felony charges in connection with a BASE jump.  According to the court's order, filed on August 9, 2017, Austin Carey, a California resident, jumped from a tree in Yosemite National Park on September 6, 2016, and was subsequently arrested and charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 2.17(a)(3) of the federal securities laws.  The court ruled that, in order to determine whether a defendant had a right to participate in BASE jumping, he had to prove that he had a valid permit.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California today announced criminal charges against Carey.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Fresno, California, charges Carey with violations of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Carey consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, and orders him to pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $1,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the company's name.
