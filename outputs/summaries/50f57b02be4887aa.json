  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against BP Products North America for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, alleges that, in 2016 and early 2017, BP Products and its co-defendant Petroleum Marketing Group (PMG) engaged in a long-running scheme to acquire approximately seventy-six Gulf-branded gas and service stations in Massachusetts. According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in this scheme because they believed that PMG was going to use the stations to sell BP branded fuels. The complaint further alleges that BP's conduct in Massachusetts was a necessary element of the scheme, because the defendants' out-of-state conduct caused significant harm to the plaintiff's reputation in the estimation of the public. The SEC alleges that this conduct led BP to violate the federal securities laws and, in violation of Section 15(b)(2) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder, and that BP violated Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder and that the court should determine whether to impose jurisdiction over BP based on the facts of the case.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against BP for its role in the alleged scheme.  On May 24, 2017, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Connecticut granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct a parallel criminal investigation. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
