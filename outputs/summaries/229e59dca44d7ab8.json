  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment against the Board of Education for failing to timely and timely release of minutes of public school board meetings.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Newark, New Jersey, on December 6, 2014, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Rymas held that the Board violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that, contrary to the Board's representations, the Board was not required to issue Rice notices to affected employees in advance of a public meeting.  In addition, the court found that Rice notices should not be issued during closed session meetings, because the Board had determined that the minutes would not be made available to the public until after the next scheduled meeting, which forced the Board to wait up to five months for the minutes to be released.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Court held that Rice notice obligations apply to all employees, regardless of whether the employee is adversely affected by the actions taken by the Board at the time of the meeting. The Court also ruled that, in a parallel action, the Appellate Division violated the Administrative Rules of Practice (\"OPMA\") by failing to provide timely and accurate information regarding the availability and timing of Rice notices. The court's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins the Board from violating the OPMA and orders it to comply with the requirements of the federal securities laws. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Secretary of State's Office, and the U.N. Office of Education's Office of Inspector General."
