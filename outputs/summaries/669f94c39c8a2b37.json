  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a Brazos County, Texas-based obstetrician and gynecologist who was terminated for refusing to arbitrate her unfair labor practices complaint with the National Labor Relations Board.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Texas, Dr. Rebecca Poole-Ward, a resident of San Diego, California, alleges that Affiliates for Women Health, a medical practice in Brazos, Texas, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the arbitration agreement violated the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that Dr. Poole was either a supervisor or a professional, not an employee covered by the federal laws, when she sought to enforce her employment agreement by asserting a breach-of-contract and common-law rights of action for her disabilities.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the parties from violating the federal and state securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Mr. Werner. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Insurance, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
