  "summary": "On August 17, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana entered a final judgment against Port City Armory, L.L.C., a Shreveport, Louisiana-based company that manufactures and sells AR-15 rifles and magazines.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Caddo, Louisiana, on February 19, 2013, Port City and its founder, Don Angle, raised the prospect of acquiring a 10% interest in Armory, which they called the FS30. The complaint alleges that the purchase orders were invalid, unenforceable, and speculative, and that Richard and Don Angle knew and failed to disclose to Sports South that they were being pressured by the company to make a one-time purchase of 10,000 magazines for a six-month period at a price of $11.00 per magazine. The SEC alleges that, contrary to these representations, the defendants continued to market and sell the magazine despite the fact that Sports South had not made a sufficient good faith effort to market the magazine. In addition, the complaint further alleges that Don Angle and his wife, Briana Stanley, participated in a series of transactions with Sports South, including one in which Sports South issued a $110,000 loan to Armory. In that transaction, Sports South allegedly issued purchase orders to Armory for the purchase of 50,000 magazine subscriptions, which were purportedly for sale at well below market value to her son and her wife, who later resold the property for great profits. The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of $250,000, prejudgment interest of $100,000 and a civil penalty of $150,000. The defendants have also agreed to pay civil penalties of $50,000 each.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Matthew G. Angle and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Angle, Mr. Werner, and Ms. Werner. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the"
