  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against two Ohio defendants in an intentional-tort claim.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Charles Trois and Samuel Schnaidt violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, in spring 2016, Michael Barrick, a Kentucky citizen, contacted Trois about selling some of his collectible items through an Ohio auction center. According to Trois's complaint, Barrick allegedly misrepresented Apple Tree's marketing tools and auction arrangements, and that he received a fee for any of his solicitations that resulted in an auction commission for Apple Tree. The complaint further alleges that, in the course of drafting the contract, Schniedt made numerous misrepresentations and \"intentionally concealed facts.\" The complaint also alleges that Barrick and Apple Tree did not have sufficient minimum contacts with Texas to establish a proper venue for the fraud claim. In addition, the SEC alleges that the defendants were subject to specific personal jurisdiction in Texas on the basis of sufficient minimum contact with Texas.  In its judgment, the court found that, under the circumstances, a Texas venue was not a fit because, as alleged, a substantial part of the alleged misrepresentations occurred during conference calls placed to Texas, the contract execution and performance took place in Ohio, and the venue was improper.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about the Texas-based securities laws, see Securities Litigation Release No. 587-373.
