  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Keo, a California resident, made a series of false statements to a social worker while in custody. Keo allegedly told the social worker that he would kill all of his children, including his own sons, if she refused to give him a Miranda warning.  Keo also allegedly told her that he was going to kill his two sons, S.L. and S.K., and that he planned to use a knife to commit the crime.  According to the complaint, Keo did not respond to a subpoena for a copy of the report, and he did not call the police or the prosecutor until a year after the interview.  In a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Keo.  On May 11, 2016, a federal district court in San Diego entered a temporary restraining order and ordered Keo to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Separately, the court issued an order suspending Keo from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, barring him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty on Keo as well as a $10,000 officer-and-director bar for Keo and a $100,000 penalty for the rest of the year.   The court also issued an emergency court order temporarily freezing Keo\u2019s assets and ordering him to surrender his passport and be barred from the securities industry.  A hearing scheduled for May 13, 2018, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Los Angeles Office of Inspector General, and the California Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
