  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was sentenced to 40 years in prison with no chance of parole for 40 years.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that, in 1994, Jerry Rice was convicted by a jury of first-degree premeditated murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. The court ruled that Rice was entitled to an updated PSI based on the facts in the case and failed to consider whether the court had sufficient information to determine whether to impose a life sentence without parole after 15 years of confinement. Rice also claimed that the court improperly refused to consider a recommendation for a new PSI when it had no options other than the sentence imposed and that it could have ordered probation. The complaint further alleges that Rice's attorney provided ineffective assistance during the penalty phase of his trial.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Rice.  On July 28, 2016, the court granted the SEC's request for a hearing on a motion to modify Rice's sentence and ordered a new hearing and resentencing. The hearing was held on July 28 and the court appointed an officer to conduct a presentence investigation into Rice's case. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kansas Department of Corrections, and the Kansas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
