  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a former Miami-Dade Police Department detective who was temporarily relieved of duty pursuant to an investigation that took place following allegations that she was missing evidence and open case files.  The court also entered a judgment against the former detective, who was also temporarily relieved.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, Florida, Gary Glasser, a former detective in the General Investigative Unit (GIU) and on uniform patrol at the Intracoastal District, was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that Glasser failed to identify any corroborating evidence to support his allegation that he had not engaged in unreasonable and vexatious conduct when confronted by a member of the unit's investigative team.  In a parallel action, on May 2, 2012, the Honorable Judge Robert W. Wilcox of the Court granted the Commission's motion for summary judgment against Glasser and ordered him to disgorge $63,825.00 in unnecessary attorney's fees and to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The Commission's order also prohibits Glasser from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission, Glasser consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $75,000 in civil penalties.  On May 5, 2013, Judge Wilcox issued a temporary restraining order and ordered Glasser to comply with the order. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas. The Office of Compliance and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Miami Office of Professional Regulation in this matter."
