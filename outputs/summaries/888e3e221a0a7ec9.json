  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Viju Mathew, a registered representative at Parkland Health and Hospital System, Inc., a Dallas, Texas-based health care company. Mathew has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $277,957.89 in restitution to a pawn shop for the purpose of recovering stolen HICNs. The judgment also orders Mathew to pay restitution to three other check-cashing entities for their losses incurred in connection with Mathew\u2019s fraud.  Mathew also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay a total of $1,078,767.71 in restitution.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Mathew with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a)(3) and 5(c) and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced criminal charges against Mathew arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint. The SEC is continuing its investigation, which is continuing to be conducted by the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
