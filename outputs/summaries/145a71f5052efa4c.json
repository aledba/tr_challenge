  "summary": "On August 17, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that SEPTA violated the First Amendment by failing to comply with the 2015 Advertising Standards.  According to the complaint, the SEC's 2015 Standards, which govern the use of advertising space on public transportation, require that a public forum be designated for the purpose of generating revenue and promoting awareness of social issues.  For example, the complaint alleges that the SEC previously rejected an advertisement about \"African-Americans holding signs protesting \"women who choose abortion\" and \"black guys not part of the protest.\"  The complaint further alleges that, in 2016, the city of Shaker Heights, Pennsylvania, rejected a proposed advertisement for the express purpose of advertising on public transit.  In its judgment, the court found that SEpTA violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the Court granted the Commission's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the Commission to consider the issues raised in the complaint. The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Police Department, the Department of Justice, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities."
