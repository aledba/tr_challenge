  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment in favor of appellee Houston Red C LLC d/b/a ImageFirst Healthcare Laundry Specialists, finding that appellants breached a laundry service agreement and are jointly and severally liable for damages, costs, interest and attorney's fees.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, Appellee breached the contract by overcharging Atrium for linens delivered from February 2013 through April 2013.  The complaint alleges that Appelelee was entitled to recover $881,918.28 of the $165,587.33 that Atrium had already paid for the linens.  In its judgment, the court found that Appellees violated the contract and, in violation of the contract, was liable for a civil penalty of $110,000.  Atrium agreed to pay $11,473.50 of the agreed-upon amount of $160,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and an attorney's fee equal to the amount of the alleged civil penalty.  On June 3, 2016, the trial court issued its final judgment, which permanently enjoins appellees from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders Appelle to pay a civil monetary penalty of 5% simple interest and a $375,021.20 attorney-and-adjudgment interest of 5%.  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Fort Worth Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Tony Gullo. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Insurance, and the Texas Office of Inspector General in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (Aug. 24, 2013)."
