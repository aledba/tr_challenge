  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered final judgments in favor of the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare and seven organizations involved in the provision of a variety of human services to poor and disabled individuals in Pennsylvania.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that, in 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed an omnibus bill that included a provision requiring that every bill be considered by both houses of the legislature on three separate days.  As alleged in the complaint, this provision violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Section 4 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  In addition, the complaint alleges that the bill contained a provision that prohibited the addition of \"riders\" to certain federal laws, such as those related to nursing home care.

On June 6, 2013, the court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the amount of money owed to the victims of the alleged fraud, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount owed to each of the victims.   The court's order also prohibits the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any order or order requiring the destruction or alteration of any of the underlying securities in the securities of the companies or entities with which they are selling the securities.  It also orders the defendants not to solicit or solicit the sale or purchase of any security deposit in the brokerage account of a broker or investment adviser, and prohibits the destruction of any purported security deposit.  Finally, the Court granted the parties' request for a preliminary injunction against future violations, ordering the defendants"
