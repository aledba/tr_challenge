  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Malibu-based businesses that sought to prevent the city from becoming \"Anything Mall, USA.\"  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Malibu, California, alleges that on November 4, 2014, Malibu residents passed Measure R, which required the city to prepare a specific plan for every proposed commercial or mixed-use development in excess of 20,000 square feet.  The complaint alleges that the city failed to comply with the requirements of the CUP, which requires a two-thirds majority of the voters to approve any development project.  According to the complaint, the City of Malibu and Malibu Bay, both of which were developing projects in the community at the time, failed to adopt the specific plan.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Malibu also agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Malibahn and the city consented to a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $150,000, and ordering Malibu to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in the amount of $20,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter."
