  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against defendant Adam Landerman, who was convicted of two counts of first degree murder and sentence of natural life imprisonment.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama on Jan. 1, 2011, Landerman was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC alleges that Landerman agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 penalty.  In its order, the court also ordered Landerman to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Landerman also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the judgment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendant and his co-defendants agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the federal laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $2,500, and ordering him to disgorge their gains with interest in the amount of $10,000, and imposing a $25,000 officer- and director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On January 2, 2018, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans issued a temporary restraining order against Landerman and ordered him to surrender his passport and return to the United States to be registered as a broker of securities. The court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations and ordered a hearing on February 13, 2018 to determine whether to proceed with a judgment imposing a permanent injunction against further violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule\u00c2\u00a0206(4)-8 thereunder, as well as the appointment of a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's receiver. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Cianfranco. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Illinois Office of the Attorney General."
