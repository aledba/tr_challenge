  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Nassau County man who was charged as a juvenile delinquent for his role in a series of high-level criminal activity.  The court entered a temporary restraining order on April 22, 2019, freezing the assets of the defendant and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  According to the court's order, filed on April 24, 2019 in the U. S. District court for the Northern District of Michigan, the defendant was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court found that the AO acted alone and was not a \"ringleader\" in determining whether he should be removed from the family court.  In its order, the court also found that, as alleged in the complaint, the defendants failed to prove the existence of \"extraordinary circumstances\" that should prevent their removal from the Family Court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, M.M. consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  M. M. also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of a penny, and to be restrained from associating with any person or private entity that may be associated with a criminal conviction. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 722.23(1).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage people to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and Section\u00c2\u00a010(b)(5) and Rule\u00c2\u00a014 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.   The complaint also alleges that, in a parallel action, the Honorable Ellen G. Welshhans (D.O.B.) issued an Order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case"
