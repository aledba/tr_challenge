  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas today entered final judgments against Plano Encryption Technologies LLC (PET) and eleven Texas banks for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that PET violated several of its patents, including those related to software systems for mobile apps.  According to the complaint, PET's patents were infringed by at least eleven banks conducting banking business in Texas.  PET's complaint alleges that the Banks are believed to be infringing the patents, and PET has agreed to indemnify the Banks for any liability arising out of or related to those activities.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Texas announced criminal charges against PET.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing PET's assets, and ordering PET to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office and the case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by David Burt and supervised by Amy C. McKinley. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
