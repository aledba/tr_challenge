  "summary": "On July 24, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan entered a final judgment against Roderick Finnmark Hadley, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to a mandatory minimum of life imprisonment.  The court granted the court's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Hadley to pay a civil penalty of 360 months to life.  According to the Court's order, Mr. Hadley was found guilty by jury trial in February 2007 of possession with intent to distribute 51.6 grams of crack cocaine under the federal antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and sentenced to 360 months imprisonment followed by 8 years of supervised release.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hadley.  On June 13, 2020, the Honorable Judge Patricia C. Fawsett of the federal district court for the District of Columbia issued an order appointing a receiver to determine the appropriate reduction of Hadley's sentence based on the statutory provisions of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Hadley consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the First Step Act and orders him to pay civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 and a $500,000 civil penalty, and requires him to be barred from serving any prison term for at least five years.  At the hearing, Judge Fawsett also granted the government's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the receiver to provide a copy of the Final Judgment to the receiver.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Florida Office of Criminal Justice."
