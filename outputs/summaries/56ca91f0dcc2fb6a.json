  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment against a Nebraska-based juvenile court for improperly exercising jurisdiction over a child custody proceeding.  The court found that Kirsten H. was a \"deprived\" child, in that she was in need of specialized treatment, including but not limited to counseling, when she was placed with her maternal grandparents in North Dakota.  According to the court's order, Kirsten was not present in Nebraska at the time of the alleged abuse, but Victoria F., Kirsten\u2019s mother, had been removed from the home and was living with her grandparents in Nebraska.  Victoria F. and Kirsten F. Fuchs, who reside in Box Butte County, N.D., agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of an order that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Victoria to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court at a later date.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Victoria Fuchs consented to a judgment that permanently restrains the jurisdiction of the court and orders her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a $50,000 civil penalty.  On August 10, 2017, the court granted Victoria a temporary restraining order against Kirsten and ordered her to return to Nebraska, where she resides with her paternal grandparents.  In a parallel action, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order granting Victoria the right to return Kirsten to her grandparents. The court also issued an order suspending Victoria from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The SEC's complaint charges Victoria with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and Section\u00c2\u00a010(b)(5) and Rule\u00c2\u00a014 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties against Victoria, and a penny stock bar against her.  A hearing on September 21, 2017 was scheduled for 10:30 a.m. EST to consider the merits of Victoria's motion for temporary custody of Kirsten. The hearing was delayed by an hour and a half, and Victoria agreed to a hearing on Sept. 21 that was not subject to court approval. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office."
