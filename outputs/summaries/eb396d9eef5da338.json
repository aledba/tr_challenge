  "summary": "On September 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against Bunzl Distribution USA, Inc. (\"Bunzl\"), an international distribution and outsourcing company based in London, that permanently enjoins the company from violating the federal tax laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that, in 2005, the California Department of Revenue (\"DIL\") issued an order requiring the company to pay a $1.4 million tax and fee to the state of California for the year 2005.  According to the complaint, the DIL order required that the company pay a certain amount of tax and fees on behalf of its owner when it was not doing business in California and was therefore not subject to a $800 minimum franchise tax because the corporation's only connection to California was its passive ownership of a 0.2-percent membership interest in a California LLC.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Bunzl has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 18633.5 of the federal securities laws, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $1,403,595, prejudgment interest of $2,246, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Bunzl also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company.
