  "summary": "On July 31, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado entered a final judgment against Sierra Glass Co., Inc. (\"Sierra Glass\"), a Colorado-based company that claims construction defect claims against six contractors for alleged defects at one of its condominium developments.  According to the court's order, AOIC, as assignee of the two contractors, issued seven insurance policies to Sierra Glass, and as part of the policy, defended Sierra Glass in the underlying lawsuit under a reservation of rights with the intent to recover the claims.  The court also ruled that the claims were premature and speculative because the judgment was final and non-appealable.  In its judgment, the court found that Sierra Glass violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(1) thereunder, and that it had failed in its duty to meaningfully participate in settlement negotiations in an effort to protect its interests in later proceedings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Sierra Glass consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay $1.9 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $3 million.   The SEC's order also orders Sierra Glass to pay a $2,489,021.91 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Denver Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Office of Insurance Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Denver Office of Financial Regulation."
