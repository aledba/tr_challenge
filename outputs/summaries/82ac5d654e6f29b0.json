  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against two Mississippi residents for their roles in a failed placement of two children.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, from at least March 2014 through August 2017, Rachel and Alex were placed in the custody of a Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services (CPS) agency.  According to the complaint, the CPS agency had provided reasonable efforts over a reasonable amount of time to diligently assist the children in complying with their service plans.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Alex, who was incarcerated for a parole violation, and Rachel, who had been living with Alex's mother, failed to exercise reasonable visitation or communication with the children after being placed in CPS custody.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on May 12, 2017, the SEC found that Alex and Rachel violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center, with the assistance of the Division of Enforcement's Office of Child and Family Education and the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services. The case has been supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley, Chief of the Enforcement's Division of Child Advocacy. The litigation will be led by David A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the FBI, the U.N. Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services."
