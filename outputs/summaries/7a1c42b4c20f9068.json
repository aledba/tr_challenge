  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Tennessee-based insurance company and its insured in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Nashville, Tennessee, alleges that, in 2012, Brandon DeBruce rear-ended a vehicle driven by Christina Wright on Interstate 24 in Hamilton County, Tennessee. The complaint alleges that DeBruce was insured under an automobile liability insurance policy issued by Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company, and that Wright was a necessary party to the action because she had a \"strong interest\" in the outcome of the insurance policy. According to the complaint, Wright failed to show up for an examination under oath under oath and failed to respond to telephone calls from Tennessee Farmers and DeBruce. The SEC alleges that Wright violated the policy when she did not cooperate with Tennessee Farmers in investigating and defending the claims asserted in the complaint. In denying Wright\u2019s motion, the trial court held that Wright had a \u201csufficiently direct\u201d interest in the coverage determination that the company did not have to provide liability coverage under the policy. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, DeBruce consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Tennessee today announced criminal charges against DeBruce arising out of the same conduct. In a related matter, the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert on the dangers of insurance fraud, including false claims about the safety of the insured's policies, and on the basis of that information the SEC is seeking a preliminary injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order requiring DeBruce to comply with a court order. In addition, the Commission of Inspections and Examinations issued an order appointing an independent receiver to oversee the investigation and resolution of any claims arising from the insurance fraud. The Commission also issued an Order appointing a receiver to assist with the investigation of the claims in the Commission's order.  On March 4, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert E. Bentsen of the United Kingdom entered a judgment ordering the receiver to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $2,500,000 and $1 million, respectively. The Court also issued a temporary restraining order, prohibiting DeBruce from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney"
