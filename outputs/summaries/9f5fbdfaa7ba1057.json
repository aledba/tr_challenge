  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (\"Transco\"), alleging that the company violated the federal securities laws by failing to comply with a court order granting the company a certificate of public convenience and necessity.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Columbia, alleges that, despite receiving notice of the company\u2019s application, the Adorers never raised this objection before FERC. Rather, the complaint alleges that the court of appeals granted the company the right to condemn the relevant section of their land, which is at issue here.  According to the complaint, the Court of Appeals ultimately issued a temporary restraining order preventing the pipeline project from running across their land.  In its order, the court found that, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to determine whether to issue a final judgment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Transco agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.\u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 5, 2017, the District Court in Philadelphia issued a preliminary injunction against the construction of the Transcontinental gas pipeline, which was subject to the court-ordered injunction. The court also issued an order requiring Transco to show cause and effect before it issued the injunction, and to pay a $329,220 civil penalty. The Adorers also agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any federal agency. The settlement is pending final approval by the court, which will determine the amount of money to be spent on the project.   In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has issued an emergency court order halting the construction and sale of unregistered securities in connection with the pending litigation. \u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the United States Postal Inspection Service (OIS) today announced an order suspending the issuance of the OIS and ordering OIS to submit an application for a court-appointed receiver. The OIS has not yet been issued, and OIS"
