  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Mexico today announced criminal charges against two Arizona men accused of stealing $1.2 million in illicit drugs.  According to the SEC's complaint, Jose R. Rodriguez-Flores and Miguel Angel Rodriguez-Rodrigues of Phoenix, Arizona, were arrested at a Phoenix airport on November 13, 2015, and charged with operating a truck without a valid driver's license. The complaint alleges that the defendants used unwitting couriers to transport large quantities of illegal drugs, including cocaine and heroin, to conceal from law enforcement that they were not in on the drug conspiracy. The SEC also alleges that one of the couriers told the SEC that he did not know of the drugs, but that he had seen them in the truck and knew that they had been used. The court also found that Rodriguez-Dominguez was not a drug trafficker and did not have any expertise in the drug trade.  The complaint further alleges that, despite having been trained as an expert on indicia of truth-telling, the defendants did not present themselves as a professional at the time they were arrested.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Guzman Dominguez, who was an FBI Special Agent who had been trained in the field, did not participate in the alleged drug trafficking.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,192,078, plus prejudgment interest of $2,620, and a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Arizona Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Arizona State Department of Banking and Securities."
