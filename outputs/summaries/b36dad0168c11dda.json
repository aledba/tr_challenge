  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 34 years in prison for two counts of attempted first-degree murder, armed robbery with a firearm, and personal discharge of a firearm.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, on September 15, 2012, defendant Anton Brown, a former member of the Mafia Insane Vice Lords gang, entered the Chicago Department of Corrections and entered the department of corrections in 2006.  The complaint alleges that Mr. Woods initially refused to participate in a PSI and then was ordered to do so by the trial court.  As alleged in the complaint, however, he did not participate in the PSI because he had quit the gang when he was 24.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Woods.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Woods agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay a $5,000 civil penalty and a $10,000 officer-and-director bar.  Woods also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $25,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, and the Illinois Attorney General's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Criminal Investigations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage people to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0OnInvestigations.gov.
