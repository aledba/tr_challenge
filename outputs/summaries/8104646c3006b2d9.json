  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a settled administrative proceeding against the University of Cincinnati, the university, and its former head of music, Neville G. Pinto, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Cincinnati, alleges that Junhe Qiu, a Chinese citizen, entered the United States on an F-1 visa in 2016 as a freshman seeking to major in violin performance. The complaint alleges that Qiu failed to show that he had access to the instructor\u2019s manual when, in March 2017, he was diagnosed with syncope and collapse from a heart defect. According to the complaint, Qiu was subsequently expelled from the university and Pinto and Losada in their official capacities. The SEC alleges that the defendants failed to adequately disclose to Qiu that they had violated the federal anti-discrimination provisions of the federal securities laws and that they were liable for violations of the university-related provisions. In addition, the complaint alleges Qiu did not respond to repeated requests for a hearing as to why he was not present at the college hearing panel when he had asked to be present at that hearing.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Education and the Department of Justice today announced criminal charges against Qiu arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint. The Office of Compliance and Regulatory Affairs has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of using investor funds to pay for personal expenses, including for Qiu's medical expenses. \u00c2\u00a0On May 22, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Qiu to comply with the court's order.  On May 24, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.   The complaint also seeks an officer-and-director bar, a conduct-based injunction, a penny stock bar, and an officer and director bar.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 556, 556 (6th Cir. 2009).  The Commission on Colleges and Universities has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Notice\u00c2\u00a0that it has not issued a Complaint against the Defendants for failing to provide timely and reasonable assistance in this matter."
