  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against Javen Evonne Davis, an employee of the United States Navy who was injured in a car accident while walking in a crosswalk on Norfolk, Va. on March 31, 2015.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Norfolk, Virginia, Davis was injured by a vehicle negligently operated by Davis.  The complaint alleges that Davis was not on duty when the accident occurred, and that he was not required to report to the on-base sports center to participate in mandatory physical training scheduled to begin at 7:30 a.m. on the morning of the accident.  Davis' claim, however, was barred by the federal court for lack of jurisdiction.  In its judgment, the court held that, in a prior federal case, Davis had acted within the scope of his duty as a member of the military.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Davis consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000 and a civil penalty of $5,000.  Additionally, Davis agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for the purpose of recovering ill-gotten gains from his or her employer.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Robert Boggs-Wilkerson of the Court of Common Pleas granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Davis, as well as a preliminary injunction against Davis and a conduct-based injunction prohibiting Davis from participating in any type of medical or recreational activity.  A hearing on June 5, 2019 will be held on the matter of a final determination by the court upon motion by the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-18, May 24, 2019.
