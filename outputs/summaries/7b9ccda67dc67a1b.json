  "summary": "On June 4, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against Pennsylvania Social Service Union, Service Employees International, and Lehigh County Board of Commissioners for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that, from at least January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018, Pennsylvania Social Services Union (PSSU) and its president, Stephen Catanese, entered into a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The CBA provides for the right of a public employee to join a union at any time, regardless of whether he is a member of the union or not. In addition, the CBA requires that a person resigning from PSSU to show cause for his or her resignation from the union. The SEC alleges that defendants failed to do this by failing to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims. The complaint also alleges that the defendants did not refund to him the interest on his dues, which he specifically requests in the amended complaint, nor did they offer him a refund of the dues deducted following his resignation. The court also found that defendants violated the federal securities laws by not providing sufficient evidence for the parties' claims.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against the same defendants.  On June 5, 2019 the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants from participating in any collective bargaining activity, including the right to reapply as an employee. The Court also issued an order requiring the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000. The order also requires the parties to pay a civil penalty of $50,000, which is equal to the amount owed to them by the court in the civil penalty.  According to the complaint, the court's order also prohibits defendants from violating the anti-fraud provision of the Exchange Act, and from imposing any monetary penalty against the parties in the future. The Commission's order, which was entered into by the Court on March 4, 2020, finds that the Commission violated Sections 10(a) and 13(b)(5) and 14(c), and requires the Commission to provide an accounting of the Commission's findings.  Additionally, the Commission has agreed to the entry of an order appointing a receiver for the Commission"
