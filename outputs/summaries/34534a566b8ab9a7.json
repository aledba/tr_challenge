  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of the Waites' motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that, from at least the late 1940s through the late 1990s, Union Carbide Corp. and nine other defendants failed to adequately disclose to investors that the company's business activities in Florida were at home.  According to the complaint, the company was not subject to general jurisdiction in Florida because it was not registered to do business in the state.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants' conduct in Florida was inconsistent with due process because the company had a history of violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Finally, the court agreed to the Waite's request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, ordering the company to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and ordering the payment of a $20,000 civil penalty.  On August 2, 2019, the U. S. District Judge for the southern district of Florida entered a temporary injunction against the defendants from further violations of federal securities law, and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and a $50,000 cash penalty, respectively.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for September 5, 2019.   The litigation will be led by Robert Mitchell, Ms. Waite, and Ms. Mascianica. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
