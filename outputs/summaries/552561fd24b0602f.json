  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Anthony Houck, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to a term of community custody and a $200 criminal filing fee.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Houck violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he violated Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of that federal securities law.  According to the complaint, Houck failed to show that the federal securities laws prohibited him from associating with known drug users and sellers during his incarceration.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court improperly imposed a community custody condition that prohibited Houck from association with known users of illegal drugs and from purchasing or selling medical marijuana.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the securities laws, imposing community custody conditions, and imposing an interest and monetary penalty on each of them. The final judgments also order Houck to pay a $500 crime victim penalty assessment and $100 DNA collection fee, and ordered him to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and $150,000 community custody fee. The court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 17, 2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages the public to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC encourages victims of drug-related crimes to contact their local law enforcement agency for assistance in recovering their allegedly ill-gotten gains.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investigative tool to quickly identify people who are at risk of being targeted by a criminal investigation.   The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against Houck.  To learn more about community custody requirements, see"
