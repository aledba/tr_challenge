Marks, Esq., a former New Mexico state attorney general, for failing to comply with the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that, between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2012, the NMPRC improperly barred Mr. Marks from serving as an attorney in connection with two pending litigation actions against the agency.  According to the complaint, the Commission improperly delayed filing a motion to disqualify him from representing Great Divide Wind Farm 2 LLC, a New Mexico-based energy company, in violation of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 15(b) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico today announced criminal charges against Marks arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  As part of the SEC's investigation, which is continuing, the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about potential conflicts of interest arising from these actions.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter, the Texas Department of Attorney General's Office, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office.  For further information, see Investor Alert:\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission Complaint No. 17-00255-11 (Jan. 24, 2019).\u00c2\u00a0On March 8, 2019\u00c2\u00a0the SEC filed a Complaint against Great Divide for violating Rule 15a-3 thereunder, and against the Commission for improperly acting as an unregistered broker-dealer.   The Commission's complaint charges Great Divide with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) and the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Adviser Advisers\").
