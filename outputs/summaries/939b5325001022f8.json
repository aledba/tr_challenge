  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Juan Carlos Escobar-Florez, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for a string of felony charges.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that, on August 8 or 9, 2007, Escobar Florez entered a guilty plea by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, on September 5, 2008, the Utah Court of Appeals granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, freezing EscobarFloreZ's assets, and barring him from appearing before the court as an attorney or practicing before the SEC as a judge, ordered him to surrender his passport and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  On September 6, 2009, the court granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered Escobarflorez to surrender to the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining him from further violations of these provisions, ordering him to disgorge his gains, pay prejudgment interests, and pay a civil monetary penalty of $25,000, and appointing a receiver to oversee the case. The court also granted the defendants' motion for an expedited hearing, which was conducted in the absence of a hearing or jury selection. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Attorney General's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (July 15, 2019)."
