  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against defendant Kenneth Brooks for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle on January 15, 2019, alleges that Brooks violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act by improperly changing the date and time of an alleged third degree child molestation charge.  According to the complaint, Brooks, who was living in California at the time of the alleged molestation, made a series of misstatements concerning the date of the crime, including that he had admitted to the crime and apologized for it.  Brooks also allegedly told C.H. that he would stay at her apartment and \"watch Netflix with her.\"  The complaint further alleges that while he and his girlfriend were at the apartment, Brooks began to rub her breast, which made it hard for him to believe that the molestation had occurred during a period of time when he could not recall the date.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Brooks.  On January 22, 2019 the Honorable Paul G. Gershfeld of the Court of Appeals granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Brooks to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Brooks consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $2,500 in disgorgements, $1,000 in civil penalties, and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to a five-year conduct-based injunction barring him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any federal securities law, including the right to reapply as an attorney after a court finds him liable for a civil injunctive action.
