  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against Heather A. Edwards, a former employee of Broadwater Casitas Care Center, LLC and Nathan Ure, in a civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia on June 12, 2013, Edwards agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay $158,471.25 in costs and attorney fees.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  In its order, the court also ordered Edwards to pay a civil penalty of $19,826, which is equal to the amount owed to each creditor.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Edwards has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the federal securities laws, ordering her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of $157,472.25.  On June 13, the bankruptcy court granted Edwards' request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, and ordered her to comply with the court's order.  As set forth in the order, this order prohibits her from, outside the bankruptcy proceeding, challenging the authority of a bankruptcy court to impose the obligation on her in the first instance.  Further, the order requires the debtor to pay an amount equal to or above the amount due to the creditor, and requires the creditor to show cause why it should not be imposed upon the debtor.  For example, the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois issued an order requiring the debtor and creditor to submit a proof of claim in a bankruptcy proceeding.   The court also issued a writ of execution on January 16, 2013.  This order prohibits the debtor from challenging the validity of the judgment, and the creditor from seeking an injunction against the imposition of any such injunction. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Justice, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority and the U.K. Secret Service."
