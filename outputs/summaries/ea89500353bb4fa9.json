  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a Brazilian divorce case, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that Thomas J. St. Denis and Daelte L. Lima-St. Denis of Lenox, Massachusetts, filed a motion to dismiss on April 21, 2017, alleging that the Brazilian court had improperly granted the defendants three weeks to present evidence to support their claims that there was no final judgment of dissolution rendered in Brazil.  According to the complaint, the court improperly denied the defendants' requests for an evidentiary hearing on the matter.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Connecticut today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 16, 2016, a Brazilian court ruled that the marriage of the parties was dissolved by a decree of divorce in Brazil, and that the parties had been entitled to joint custody and child support at the time the judgment was rendered.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,038,767, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  At a hearing on June 13, 2017 the court granted the defendant's motion for a hearing and granted the court's order for an expedited hearing.  After the hearing, the judge granted the plaintiff's request for an injunction and a temporary restraining order, and ordered the court to consider the merits of the motion.   The court also issued an order granting the defendant a hearing to determine whether or not to proceed with an application for a preliminary injunction against the dissolution of the marriage.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2017 was delayed until the court reviewed the evidence submitted by the defendant and approved by the court.  As a result of this review, the defendants were not able to show that there had been any final judgment in Brazil on their behalf, and the court did not grant the plaintiff a hearing or an opportunity to present any evidence to prove her claims.  Finally, on June 6, 2017 a federal district court in Brazil granted the motion for an emergency hearing on a related matter, and a hearing was held on June 7, 2017.  To determine whether a hearing should be held on the same day as the Brazilian judgment, see \u00a7 46b-44 (a) and (c)"
