  "summary": "On October 5, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment in favor of the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office's motion for a temporary restraining order and other emergency relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that Anthony Haines violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder, and that, in violation of Section 10(b) of Exchange Act Rule 10b2-1, the federal securities laws that govern the securities industry.  In its judgment, the court held that, under Pennsylvania law, a person who engages in a serious felony or a serious drug offense can be deemed a \"career offender\" if he or she does not specifically intend to use force to harm another person.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $75,000 civil penalty.  On October 6, 2018, the Court granted the SEC request for an emergency restraining order, a temporary injunction, and an emergency court order.  According to the court's order, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, a conduct-based injunction, a penny stock bar, and the return of any officer or director of a public company.  A hearing for the SEC is scheduled for October 13, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release No. 17-cv-5221.
