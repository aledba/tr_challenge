  "summary": "On February 22, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Rumpelstiltskin, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Resource Technology Corporation (RTC), that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders RTC to pay a penalty of $3, multiplied by the amount of landfill gas produced.  The court also found that RTC failed to provide any credible evidence that it had the rights to sell landfill gas at those landfills.  According to the court's order, RTC and the other defendants failed to adequately record their receipt of the tax credits.  In addition, the court found that the appellants could not claim credits for venting or flaring landfill gas because they did not have the technology to measure landfill gas output.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoined RTC from violating these provisions, and ordered the company to pay an accuracy penalty of 20%.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  On February 24, 2016 the Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of $586,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of 10% of the company\u2019s pre-tax income, and issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.    The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, and the United States Postal Inspection Service in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.
