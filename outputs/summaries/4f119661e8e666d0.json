  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of South Carolina today entered a final judgment in favor of the government's motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of two of its co-conspirators, Kevin Howard and Tyrone Drayton, and ordering a mistrial.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, South Carolina, on July 25, 2016, the government alleged that Kevin Howard, a convicted felon, kidnapped Adrian Lyles from his home in 2012 and, together with Howard and Draytons, drove to a remote South Carolina island where the three men shot Lyles a total of ten times in retaliation for Lyles' work as an informant for law enforcement authorities. The complaint alleges that the government failed to satisfy its burden of showing manifest necessity by issuing a subpoena requiring Grant to appear at a new trial.  The complaint further alleges that, in the course of the trial, the court granted the government a second round of subpoenas, without considering the viability of the alternative options. The court then granted the mistrial motion, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and ordered the government to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David Downum, Kelly L. Gibson, and Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Justice in this matter."
