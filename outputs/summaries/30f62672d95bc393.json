  "summary": "On May 22, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a final judgment against Robert \"Bob\" Walters, Esq., a New York City attorney who was charged with orchestrating an extortion scheme that targeted two of his clients.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Walters agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  The judgment also prohibits Walters from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Walters on March 7, 2018.  On March 8, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint against Walters, alleging that he suffered from a conflict of interest arising out of his ability to represent both his client and the defendant in a timely and effective manner. The SEC also charged Walters with violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 924(c)(1)(A) and 924 (j)(1) and the broker-dealer registration provision of Section 13(b)(2)(B).  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jeffrey Pittell, of the New York Regional Office, and was supervised by Marc Blau. The litigation will be led by Ms. Perez. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice in this matter."
