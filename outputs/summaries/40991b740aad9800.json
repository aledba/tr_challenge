  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (ONRA) in a civil penalty case brought by the Oil&Gas Regulatory Authority.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas, alleges that ONRA violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1719(d) of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the rule imposes a mandatory minimum of five years of mandatory compliance with the federal reporting requirements for oil and gas leases.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, ONRA consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins ONRR from violating these provisions, and orders ONRR to pay a penalty equal to the amount of the civil penalty.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Scherer of the U. S. District court for the Northern District of California granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against ONRR.   The Commission's complaint charges ONRR with violating the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 1719 and 1720 of the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  ONRR has agreed to settle the case against it by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of these provisions. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center, with the assistance of the Division of Enforcement's Enforcement's Office of Compliance and Risk Analysis.
