  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a former prisoner who was charged with violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in El Paso, Colorado, alleges that Heshimo Yaphet Carr violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the complaint, Mr. Carr, who was a pretrial detainee at El Paso County's jail at the time, had a broken foot and had been ordered by a medical professional to remove all supports from his medical boot and to place no weight on the foot.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, that Ms. Creek did not have the requisite knowledge or experience to determine whether to issue a judgment that would impose permanent injunctions, impose a civil penalty, or impose a penny stock bar against Carr.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in a second amended complaint, Carr failed to allege that Correct Care Solutions, a private company acting under color of state law, did any such \"sanctioned\" or ordering\" medical care on his injured foot, resulting in new breaks in bones of the broke foot, and requiring him to lose access to the medical boot, as well as his wheelchair and crutches.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Carr consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Department of Corrections, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
