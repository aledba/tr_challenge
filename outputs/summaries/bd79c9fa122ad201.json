  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against a New Mexico man for violating the spousal communication privilege.  According to the SEC's complaint, on April 8, 2002, Jose Valverde was found dead in a boxcar he used as his home in Clovis, New Mexico.  The complaint alleges that, on the day of the murder, Gutierrez left home for about an hour and was visibly upset when he returned.  As alleged in the complaint, Gutierrez told his wife that he had raped her several times when she was thirteen or fourteen years old.  He allegedly told her that he would find a shotgun shell and use it to kill the victim.  In addition, he allegedly told Nicole about the victim\u2019s death and threatened to \u201csend him away for the rest of his life.\u201d  He also allegedly told his second wife, Evelyn, that she could deduce that Gutierrez had killed the victim regardless of any statements he made.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On May 9, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert M. Birkenheier of the New Mexico Court of Appeals granted a temporary restraining order against Gutierrez, ordering him to surrender his passport, and appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.  Separately, the court granted a preliminary injunction against Gutierrez and ordered him to comply with the court's order.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Mark Regan, Kenneth W. Graham, and Thomas G. Krattenmaker of the Salt Lake Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Division of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Regan and Ms. Graham and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New Mexican Attorney General's Office in this matter."
