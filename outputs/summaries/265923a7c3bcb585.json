  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the Appellants against Weber.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Weber was injured in a January 9, 2014, motor vehicle accident.  According to the complaint, Weber, who was working within the scope of his employment with K & L Construction, was injured by a tractor-trailer accident and was unable to avoid a head-on collision.  Weber's medical providers, Dr. John Bosch, and Dr. Matthew McKenzie, agreed to settle the case by agreeing to pay $813,480 for pain and suffering, $35,520 for lost wages, and $20,000 for a loss of consortium claim.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Weber consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 15-6-26 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  In addition, Weber agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the judgment, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Weber arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint against Weber, charging him with violating Section 15 of the Exchange Act, Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Weber from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert witness.
