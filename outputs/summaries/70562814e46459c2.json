  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Connecticut yesterday entered a final judgment against the city of Hartford in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut, alleges that, on February 12, 2011, a nonresident who was present in the building started a fire on the third floor. The complaint alleges that Gartrell and his commercial tenant, Debra Nails, told the city that they were going to do something different on this case and that the trial court had met with counsel in chambers and explained the procedure it planned to follow.

The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel administrative proceeding, the U. S. Attorney's Department for the Eastern District of Conn. today announced criminal charges against the Defendants for their roles in the scheme of the scheme.  On March 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Steven A. Mascianica entered final judgments ordering the defendants to comply with the court's order, ordering the destruction of the building, and ordering the city and its agents and officials to remove the building from the public view. The final judgments also order the defendants not to violate the anti-jurisdictional provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and order the destruction and destruction of any building deemed to be deemed imminent.
