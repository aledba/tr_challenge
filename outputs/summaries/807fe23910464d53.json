  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a Missouri man who was convicted of first-degree sexual abuse in the first degree.  The SEC's complaint, filed on May 4, 2015, alleges that Richard Bjorgo, of Kearney, Missouri, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from approximately May 4 through May 5, 2015 through a series of events in the women\u2019s restroom at First United Methodist Church in Kearney that led to Bj\u00f6rgo's arrest and conviction, the SEC alleges that BjorGo tried to touch the breasts of a woman in the restroom while displaying a sharp instrument in a threatening manner, and that he did so for the purpose of gratifying his own sexual desire.  In a parallel action, on May 6, 2016, the United States District Court in Missouri entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a $500,000 civil penalty against him.  On May 8, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the Court of Common Pleas granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar in connection with the case.  A hearing on May 10, 2018, was scheduled for 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri State Attorney General's Office, the Missouri Department of Justice, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Criminal Investigations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov.
