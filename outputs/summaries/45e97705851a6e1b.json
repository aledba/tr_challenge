  "summary": "On May 22, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Natascha DiFrancesco and her husband, Bryan, that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Cattaraugus County, New York, alleges that, on or about December 4, 2018, the defendants and their then-current owner, Natasacha, breached their contractual obligations by advertising and utilizing their properties as rental units through Airbnb, Inc., and HomeAway, Inc. (collectively, the \"Properties\").  According to the complaint, the Defendants violated their obligations under Rule 19(a)(2) by failing to properly serve their obligations as a necessary and indispensable party in their use of the Properties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendants and Bryan consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 each.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged violations of Rule 19a-1 and Rule 19b2-3 thereunder.  On May 21, 2020, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered them to remove their Sunset Road rental listings from any online websites, and ordered the parties to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Additionally, the Court granted the parties' request for a temporary restraining order against Bryan, and issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the properties.  As a result of the court's order, the parties agreed to settle the matter without prejudice.  To settle the case, they also agreed to the issuance of a permanent injunction, which prohibits the defendants from violating any of the above-mentioned provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  Finally, the settlements are subject to approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5, No. 207-1, Lit. 206-2, Lit"
