  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Nebraska today announced criminal charges against Zachary A. Mueller for his role in a 2015 mass shooting that left Pedro Adrian Dominguez dead.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Nebraska, Mueller was charged with first-degree murder and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited person based on his previous felony conviction.  The complaint alleges that Mueller provided false testimony to the court in connection with Mueller\u2019s sentencing.  Mueller also alleges that the court improperly gave Mueller credit for the 91 days he spent in custody in Wyoming after Mueller was convicted of the same felony in 2015.  As alleged in the complaint, Mueller also falsely claimed that Mueller had a history of drug use and that he had been a drug user when he was a child.  In reality, Mueller had no criminal history and had no prior felony convictions.  On March 7, 2016, a federal district court in Morrill County, Nebraska, granted Mueller a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return to Nebraska to be sentenced to a minimum of 20 years and a half of the mandatory minimum of 40 years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Mueller consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a $10,000 officer-and-director bar.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Nebraska State Attorney General's Office, the FBI Criminal Investigation Division, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service and the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services."
