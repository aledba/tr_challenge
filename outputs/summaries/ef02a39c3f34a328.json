  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Orlando Trinidad, a former officer of the New Jersey Department of Public Safety, for his role in an October 2012 police brutality case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, alleges that, on June 7, 2012, Trinidad entered a guilty plea and was sentenced to a five-year prison term.  According to the complaint, on the morning of the alleged incident, Jeter confronted the officers and told them that he was a \"big time celebrity now basking in the afterglow.\"  The complaint further alleges that Jeter told the officers that he \"was just afraid\" because he had engaged with the media before trial, and that he had filed a civil suit for a \"civil suit for big dollars\" and was \"living the American dream.\"  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a real estate investment.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint against Jeter alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c).  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In addition, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of Section 17(a)(1) of The Securities Act of 1933.  On March 26, 2019, a federal judge in New Jersey issued an order suspending Jeter from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering him to surrender his passport and be enjoined from future securities law violations, including securities laws violations, and from participating in any offering or solicitation of an officer or director of a public company.  Jeter also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer and director of an SEC-registered securities firm, and to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  He also agreed not to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of Jeter's alleged misconduct, which was conducted by staff in the Division of Enforcement's Criminal Justice Division.
