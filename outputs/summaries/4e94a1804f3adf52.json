  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Montana today entered a final judgment against David Lynn Weik, a convicted felon who was sentenced to five years in prison for stalking Thresa Goldberg.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Missoula, Montana, alleges that Weik violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Weik also violated the right to confrontation provision of the federal securities laws, which requires a defendant to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his or her actual ill-gotten gains.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, because of Weik\u2019s inability to see Goldberg during the majority of her testimony, Goldberg began taking medication for anxiety, depression, and insomnia, and, in April 2014, the justice court issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting Weik from entering within 1500 feet of the defendant, Goldberg and Broad's house, and the post office box at the end of her house.  After the court entered the final judgment, the SEC ordered Weik to pay $42,798.80 in restitution, which the court determined was not compensable as a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, weik consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws and orders him to pay the restitution amount in a civil proceeding.  Weik has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be prohibited from associating with anyone with a history of criminal conduct.  On August 9, 2016, the court granted Weik's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered a hearing on August 10, 2016 in the District Court that would determine whether to proceed with the restitution order.   The court also ordered that the SEC's investigation be conducted by David Stock and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Montana State Attorney General's Office, the FBI, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Mont., and the Montana Department of Criminal Justice."
