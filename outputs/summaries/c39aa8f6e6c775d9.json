  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California yesterday entered a final judgment against Orange County, California, and the City of Orange County in a related administrative proceeding.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orange County on June 17, 2011, the city of Orange and the Orange County planning commissions agreed that a general plan amendment to the city's 2010 general plan would be required to permit residential development on the property.  The complaint alleges that the city and the planning commission agreed that the general plan should be consistent with the specific plans and that it should not be delayed by a clerical error.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the final judgment did not require the city to change the specific plan.  Instead, the complaint alleges, the City and the Planning Commission did not consider the specific intent of the original general plan and instead deferred to the recommendations of the city attorney.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Milan for his role in the alleged scheme.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Milan has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from participating in any future municipal planning decisions.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Marc Blau of the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Blau, Ms. Gibson, and Ms. McGlynn.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Planning and Inspections and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Land Use and Planning in this matter."
