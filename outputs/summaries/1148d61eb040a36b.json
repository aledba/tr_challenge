  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Nebraska today announced criminal charges against a Bridgeport, Nebraska, school district curriculum and assessment coordinator.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Patrick Robinson, who was hired as the school district\u2019s curriculum coordinator in 2013, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 79-827 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Robinson told the school board that he was tired of hearing about his alleged misconduct and that he did not want to be associated with others performing the same or similar duties.  Robinson also alleged that he had received an email from the school administration stating that Robinson had left a funny note in her locker during a meeting on whether to cancel his contract.  In addition, Robinson alleged that one of the school staff members had confronted Robinson about his conduct during a previous contract period, and he had confronted the school principal about it.  After learning about the alleged misconduct, Robinson allegedly refused to come out of his office and attend meetings with staff and administration, even after being directed to do so by the school administrator.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Robinson was not a professional at the time and did not have the ability to respond to criticism in a healthy way and to develop working relationships with colleagues.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint and the facts of the case, Robinson consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  This matter was investigated by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Education, and the case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the U.N. Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and other relevant authorities."
