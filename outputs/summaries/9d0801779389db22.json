  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Canadian citizen and co-owner Mohammad \"Mike\" Souheil for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(2) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that, from at least February 2016 through at least August 2018, the defendants engaged in a fraudulent telemarketing scheme that targeted the United States.  According to the complaint, as part of this scheme, they engaged in \"deceptive\" telemarking, including making and directing deceptive phone calls to U. S. consumers in order to induce them to pay exorbitant fees.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants used telemarketers who were not registered with the SEC as a broker-dealer to generate the revenue for the scheme.  For example, the SEC alleges that one of the defendants sent corporate jets to McAllen, Texas on numerous occasions in an attempt to induce the sale of the telemarketer's stock.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On June 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the Federal Court in Dallas granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Texas Secretary of State's Office and the Texas Department of Banking and Securities and Investments."
