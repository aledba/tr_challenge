  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against a former husband and wife who were charged with defrauding investors in two Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. brokerage accounts.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Va., William Nelson Bayles was married to his second wife, Debra Bayles, for 22 years. The complaint alleges that, during his career, Bayles had invested in his employer\u2019s 401(k) retirement plan, and he designated her as the sole beneficiary of both accounts. The SEC alleges that Bayles claimed that the arbitration clauses in the contracts were enforceable, and that he was required to arbitrate her claims. However, the court found that, on the date of his death, the arbitration clause was not enforceable and that the plaintiff could not have moved the money out of his plan and into the brokerage account without receiving her consent. The court also ruled that, by early 2012, the plaintiff was entitled to the benefits from both accounts, even though she was not a signatory to the arbitration agreements.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Bayles.  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint charges Bayles with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC Complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to pay civil penalties of $132,660, and impose penny stock bars against each of them, and order Bayles to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Bayles has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any offering of investment securities. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On September 15, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Jeffrey Evans, charging him with violating Section 17(a)(1) of The Securities Act of 1933, Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Section 15(a) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting"
