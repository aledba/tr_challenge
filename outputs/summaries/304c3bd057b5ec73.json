  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Ronald King, Jr. for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, in 2015, King was convicted of two counts of first-degree sexual abuse and one count of second-degree sodomy.  According to the complaint, King consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws.  King also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against King.  On May 16, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert G. Lawson of the U. S. District Judge's Office in Jackson issued a temporary restraining order against King, ordering him to comply with the court's order, and imposing a five-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the SEC's investigation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the court also ordered King to pay a civil penalty of $10,000 and ordered him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $5,000.   The court also issued an order suspending King from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, barring him from associating with any broker dealer or investment adviser, and ordering him not to participate in any securities offering or offering offering in any future securities offering. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Attorney General's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
