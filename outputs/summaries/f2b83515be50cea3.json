  "summary": "On September 26, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Toyota Motor Corp. and Toyota Motor Sales, Inc. (\u201cTMS&rsquo;) that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that the defendants violated Rule 608(b)-5, which requires the court to determine whether a defendant is entitled to a jury trial based on whether she is a \"seat-belt expert of any kind.\"  The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the defendants' claims, Cantrell was not wearing her seatbelt at the time of the accident, and that she was ejected from the vehicle shortly after the accident.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to establish the foundation for admitting her testimony because she did not examine the seat-belt buckle or observe the types and locations of her injuries when she subsequently inspected the Tundra.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Cantrell's testimony was inconsistent with the evidence presented to the court by two other expert witnesses who also testified about the rollover accidents.  For example, one of the expert witnesses, Stephen Syson, testified that he was the first state trooper on the scene of the crash when he found that the driver's seat belt buckle was unlatched during a rollover.  Syson also allegedly told the jury that he saw Cantrell attempt to merge into the middle lane from the left side of the highway when she was confronted by a car.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Syson and Syson consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with interest, imposing civil penalties, and imposing officer-and-director bar against them.   The final judgment also prohibits the defendants from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and orders the destruction of any evidence that may be relevant to the determination of a civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office, with the assistance of the Office of Inspector General's Office, Criminal Investigations, and the Department of Justice's Office of Public Health and Human Services.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Syson."
