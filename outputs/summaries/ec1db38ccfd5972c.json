  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against a Walnut Grove, Mississippi man for his role in an October 2015 triple homicide.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that defendant Victor McBeath, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2015, acted delusional, psychotic, and was not taking any medications at the time of the alleged crime.  According to the complaint, he told his trial counsel that he was going crazy because he had been called to the house several times on \"disturbance calls,\" and that he \"was acting different\" and \"crazy.\"  The complaint further alleges that Mcbeath claimed during one meeting that he had taken some \"bad dope and drank prior to his arrest\" and that his brother had \"stolen his mind.\"  In a parallel action, the federal district court for the middle district of Mississippi on July 5, 2017, entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $100,000, and imposing officer and director bar and penny stock bars, and ordering him to surrender his passport.  In addition, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations, ordered him to cooperate with the investigation of the matter, and issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On July 6, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the appointment of a new trial judge.   In its complaint, the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for Middle Mississippi and the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced parallel criminal charges in the same case. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
