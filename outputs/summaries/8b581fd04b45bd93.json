The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that, in 2016, the Commission issued an order requiring electric utilities to purchase power from qualified, non-residential power producers (QFs) by the date of interconnection at the time the QFs were scheduled to be built.  The complaint further alleges that the Commission's order required QFs to be ready to interconnect and deliver energy at a reasonable time, and that QFs did not comply with PURC's requirements.  According to the complaint, QFs are not subject to the same federal and state requirements as QFs, and QFs do not qualify for the same exemption.

Additionally, the court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of QFs' avoided costs.

The Commission's complaint charges Great Divide with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of"
