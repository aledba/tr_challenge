  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two former members of the Allentown Women's Center (AWC) who are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Anthony Sulpizio and Mark Bogunovich violated FACE by engaging in the use of force and making threats of force in violation of the federal law.  According to the complaint, the defendants also violated the \"threat of force\" provision of FACE, which requires a person to show a reasonable probability of eventual success in a civil injunctive action against a person who is providing or providing reproductive health services at the center.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in physical obstruction by using a combination of verbal and physical force to obstruct the entry of patients into the AWC clinic.  Sulpizzio also allegedly used a series of videos to demonstrate that he is not engaged in force, threat of force, or physical obstruction, and that he has \"no memory of [Sulpizio] either standing still and blocking a car or seeing that a car was coming in and slow walking to keep that person waiting there.\"  The court also found that Sulpitzio violated FACE for his conduct in April 2017, when he allegedly confronted an AWC employee who had confronted him about his \"baby killer\" remark and asked him to \"come on back here, you cunt.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced parallel criminal charges against the defendants.  On June 26, 2019, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar in connection with the ongoing litigation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, SulPizio consented to entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating FACE, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $250,000, and orders him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  At the same hearing, the Court granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction, which was entered without prejudice to the other defendants, and granted the request for an officer and director bar in accordance with the First and Second Principles of the Commission's Rules of Practice.   The Court also issued an order suspending the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security"
