  "summary": "On July 19, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a preliminary injunction against a Texas-based school district from enforcing its facilities ban on a public school principal.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that, on July 11, 2019 at HISD's Board of Education meeting, Florida resident Irma Sandate made a threat to the principal of Fonville Middle School, Florida, that he would \"take out\" her.  According to the complaint, Sandate replied by saying, \"I got a team that can protect every last one of [the] teachers.\"  The complaint further alleges that after Sandate's threat, Plaintiff paused, pulled up a bandana over his nose and mouth and spoke in a slower, deeper tone to say, \"Do something with that idiot over there. This is the mandate: either you take out or I'm going to take her out,\" followed by a gesture with his hand that some thought imitated a gun.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Plaintiff consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Sandate.  On July 20, the SEC filed a second amended complaint, this time charging Sandate with violating Section 5 of the federal securities laws and ordering her to pay civil penalties of $150,000, $50,000 and $75,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and requiring her to return to her home state of Texas to be registered as a practicing attorney.  Sandate agreed to settle the SEC action by consenting to a permanent injunction against further violations of the securities laws, and to the issuance of a civil injunctive relief.  He also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney under the supervision of an officer or director of a public university.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 17 (Sept. 24, 2018).  The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Texas Department of Education, and the Florida Department of Banking and Securities."
