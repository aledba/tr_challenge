  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of a California-based company and its founder in a civil action brought by a federal district court against them.  The SEC's complaint, filed on February 21, 2017, alleges that the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFA) and DFA-affiliated entities violated the antifraud provisions of Section 51.7 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 51.1 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 13(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-3 thereunder, the defendants violated the right to a fair and equitable hearing provision of the federal securities laws. The court also found that, contrary to the claims in the complaint, the arbitration agreement was not preempted by federal law, and the parties agreed not to violate any of the provisions of the arbitration agreements. In addition, the court found that the defendants failed to show sufficient evidence to convince the court that arbitration agreements are not preemptable under federal law.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles on April 25, 2014, Saheli, a resident of San Diego, California, and a member of DFA's Board of Directors, agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the securities laws and requires her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $25,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions and ordering them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $50,000 each. The judgment also prohibits the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any arbitration agreement. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, as well as an order requiring DFA to comply with the requirements of Section 1295 of the Federal Arbitration Act and the Rule 1295-1. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Compliance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the California Attorney General's Office."
