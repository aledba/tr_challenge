  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against defendant John Gonzales, Jr. for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that Gonzales made a false and misleading statement during a plea negotiation in which he falsely claimed that he would have accepted a guilty plea if he had done something wrong.  Gonzales also alleges that he was the first to mention plea negotiations when confronted by an officer who asked him to do something he would not do.  According to the complaint, Gonzales replied, \"No, I did not do anything wrong. I just made a statement that was essentially an admission of guilt.\"  The complaint further alleges that the officer asked Gonzales if he would submit to a breath or blood test, and Gonzales allegedly replied, \u201cYes, I would. I will.\u201d  The court's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins Gonzales from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico announced criminal charges against Gonzales.  On May 24, 2017, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Baca granted Gonzales' motion for a temporary restraining order, ordered Gonzales to surrender his passport, and ordered him to appear and practice before the court as a free and simple citizen.  A hearing for Gonzales is scheduled for May 26, 2017.  Judge Baca will consider the merits of Gonzales\u2019s case.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2017-NMCA-020, No. 17-cv-0221, (Aug. 31, 2017).  The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Division of Criminal Justice.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New Mexico State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
