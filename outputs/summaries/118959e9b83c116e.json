  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against James A. Bulen, Jr., a trustee of a California-based charitable trust, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, James and two of his sons, James Sr. and James Jr., engaged in a long-running scheme to misappropriate trust assets to fund self-serving litigation. The complaint alleges that James and James misappropriated the trust assets for personal use, including to pay for many of the beneficiaries' travel expenses and to travel to San Diego to participate in the probate litigation.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants violated their duty of loyalty and fair treatment by failing to disclose material facts concerning the misappropriation of trust assets.  In its judgment, the court found that James violated his fiduciary duty and duty to the beneficiaries, and ordered him to pay $260,948.34 plus interest of $40,958.16 for the ordered attorney fees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, James consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes civil penalties of $160,000.  James also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a $33,045 civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement.  On August 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in San Francisco entered a judgment ordering a preliminary injunction against James, ordering him to comply with the court's order, and appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the receiver's receiver.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Marc Blau of the San Diego Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
