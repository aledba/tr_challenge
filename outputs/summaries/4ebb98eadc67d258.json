  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against the former Regional Director of Acadiana Technical College Systems and Phyllis Dupuis, finding that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, alleges that, from at least July 2011 through July 2011, Dupuises failed to inform students set to graduate in May 2011 of the new FBI background check requirements. The complaint also alleges that she did not inform her fellow department head that she planned to retire.  According to the complaint, however, after learning of the alleged misconduct from her supervisor, she consulted with the Board's attorney, the Assistant Human Resources Manager in the Systems office for the Board, and ATC Human Resources manager regarding what to do about the situation with Plaintiff and whether she was entitled to a pre-termination hearing. As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Plaintiff was never given an opportunity to give reasons why she should not be terminated before being presented with her termination letter on July 11, 2011, which referenced immediate termination.  In addition, the complaint alleges that after receiving the July 11 termination letter, she retained counsel who asserted that she had suffered a due process violation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission Report, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The Commission also issued an order requiring the Department Head of Health Occupations to provide an accounting of her duties as a department head.  On August 24, 2012, the Commission issued its final judgment, ordering the Department of Health and Human Resources to comply with the Commission's order, ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and ordering the Division of Education to appoint a receiver to oversee the investigation.  ATC has agreed to the payment of a $15,000 civil penalty. The SEC is continuing to investigate the matter of whether or not to issue an order imposing a preliminary injunction, imposing an officer-and-director bar, and appointing a receiver for the District of Lafayette. The investigation was conducted by Jason Mascianica and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Commission on Education and Advocacy."
