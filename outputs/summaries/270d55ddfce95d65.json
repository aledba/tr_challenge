  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was sentenced to probation without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the complaint.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that, from at least September 2013 through September 2014, defendant Matthew R. Watts of Houston, Tex., engaged in an aggressive and aggressive conduct that resulted in the revocation of probation for one count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and aggravated promotion of prostitution.  According to the complaint, Watts engaged in a series of aggressive actions, including brandishing a gun and making a threat to the father of a runaway trafficked child.  In one instance, the complaint alleges that the father confronted appellant and confronted him.  At the time of the alleged conduct, Watts was on probation for a prior felony conviction for the same conduct.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, the defendant had been convicted of the same felony by a jury in a previous trial, and the jury had the opportunity to determine whether to revoke probation or impose a new one.  On the other hand, the SEC alleges that appellant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he violated the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  To determine the severity of the misconduct, the court must determine whether the defendant acted at least recklessly because a reasonable person would be surprised to hear that he did not take responsibility for those actions.  For example, in one case, Watts raised the issue of whether a trial court should impose a penalty based on facts not in evidence, such as that appellant put a gun to his father's head and told him to \"get the fuck away from my car. I'm taking your girl.\"  The complaint also alleges that Watts acted recklessly by signing plea papers that contained false and misleading information about the nature of the crime, including that appellant forced the father to have oral sex with a child for money, which later served to convince the trial court that he had violated the provision of the federal securities laws.  Watts also raised the question of whether the jury should determine whether a penalty should be imposed on a defendant based on those facts, and whether a jury should be able to determine that the penalty should not be imposed based on the evidence.  Finally, in a related case, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Watts for his role in a similar conduct"
