  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Lyons, Kansas, alleges that, on the second day of trial, defendant Donnie W. King told a jury of potential jurors that one of the jurors had spoken about a settlement offer in the case with and in front of other potential jurors during voir dire examination.  According to the complaint, J.W. replied that he had not heard anything about the settlement offer and that he did not believe it was a ground for a reversal, a new trial, or a mistrial.  In addition, the complaint alleges that King failed to volunteer his knowledge of or knowledge of the case or the facts before he was called to the jury.  As a result, King was not able to participate in the jury selection process for the trial.  Instead, he was removed from the jury after the jury deliberated for more than an hour and a half.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, King consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  King also agreed to a one-year officer-and-director bar and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval, and the court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Welshhans and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Kansas Division of Criminal Justice. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Kansas Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Missouri Department of Justice Criminal Division's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, as well as the Kansas Office of Professional and Risk Analysis and the Missouri Office of the Attorney General's Retail Strategy Task Force."
