  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment in favor of the political subdivision plaintiffs in a civil action brought by the Colorado Secretary of State's Office.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that certain individual legislator plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge Colorado\u2019s Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) because they were asserting an institutional injury.  According to the complaint, the Texas-based entity that administers TABOR, which prohibits state and local governments from imposing new taxes or raising taxes except by popular vote, was created by the federal government in violation of the Guarantee Clause of the federal securities laws.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, this provision prevents the state legislature and local government from appropriating revenue in excess of the prior year's spending, and it requires the state and the local governments to refund taxpayers for revenues appropriated in excess the prior years\u2019 spending.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the district court to determine whether any other plaintiffs had standing.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against one of the defendants.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants\u2019 assets, and imposing a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be imposed by the court upon the parties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
