  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a contractor accused of home improvement fraud.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Thomas R. Blackwell, of LaPlace, Louisiana, was hired as a contractor to perform repair work on the Calmeses' home in 2012.  According to the complaint, in mid-September 2012, Mr. and Mrs. Calmes hired defendant as their foreman to perform work on their home because of his competitive quote, projected timeline, and willingness to perform all of her home repairs. The complaint alleges that defendant indicated that he was qualified as a forensic expert on tile, stone, and flooring, and that he would hire subcontractors to do the work.  Instead, the complaint alleges, defendant spent approximately $8,000.00 of their own money purchasing cabinets and countertops at John Sun Kitchen and Bath, and $2,824.00 on his ex-girlfriend's home.  As alleged, defendant was unaware that a lien was pending on the property because of outstanding fees owed to John Sun for the cabinets; however, when she became aware, the money owed was paid by another contractor.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order finding that defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay $38,900.00 in restitution.  On January 25, 2016, the trial court sentenced defendant on his felony and misdemeanor convictions to six months imprisonment without probation or suspension of sentence.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar against him.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay disgorgement of $6,500.00 plus prejudgment interests of $1,829.00, a civil penalty of six months, and to be restrained from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  To settle the case, the SEC agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval.  Among other things, the court agreed to the appointment of a receiver to determine the amount of restitution owed to each of the defendants and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty."
