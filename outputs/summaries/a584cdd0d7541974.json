  "summary": "On May 11, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of two felony counts of simple escape, a violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 15b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered him to disgorge $1,300 in ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, the defendant was initially charged by the SEC as a third felony offender, having been previously convicted of two separate drug-related charges. The SEC alleges that the defendant failed to properly preserve that claim and instead exercised two more peremptory challenges, before he used one more from that venire group before additional potential jurors were questioned.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against a defendant for failing to comply with the court's order to remove the defendant from the jury.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $15,000, and imposes a $75,000 civil penalty against him, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the New Orleans Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson, Ms. Monk, and Ms. Werner. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Louisiana Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
