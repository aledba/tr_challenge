  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against defendant HomEq Servicing, Inc., a company that serviced a home in Riverside, California.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, from July 2005 through August 2008, plaintiff refinanced the loan on his home with a total loan amount of $815,000.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the foreclosure, plaintiff was unable to make payments on the loan and suffered emotional distress when he refused to accept payments under the agreement.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants also failed to disclose to the court that the loan modification agreement was in writing and that they had no intention of honoring their promise to provide a reasonable modification of the loan.  In addition, the complaint alleges, plaintiff failed to make any payments during the foreclosure and suffered significant losses in his rental income.  Finally, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief, and imposing a penny stock bar against each of them.  On November 5, 2008, a federal district court in Los Angeles issued a temporary restraining order halting the foreclosure of the home.  At the time the court issued the order, the SEC was seeking a preliminary injunction, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants, as well as an officer and director bar against all of the defendants.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Banking and Securities, and the California Office of Financial Regulation."
