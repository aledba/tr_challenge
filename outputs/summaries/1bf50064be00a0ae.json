  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the SEC against them.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In its complaint, the defendants also allege that the defendants failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on their libel and false light claims.  According to the complaint, defendants falsely claimed that RSHO was contaminated with heavy metals and solvents without verifying the accuracy of the testing results from Stewart Environmental Consultants, LLC, a Fort Collins, Colorado-based company that manufactures and sells rheumatism-based medical marijuana products.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, this is false and defamatory, and the defendants have failed to adequately demonstrate that they are liable for the defendants\u2019 violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  For example, the SEC alleges that defendants misrepresented to a trial court that one of the defendants had a reasonable chance of prevailing in a libel action when, in fact, the trial court had no such chance of finding a reasonable basis for granting the defendants a permanent injunction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants the right to a temporary restraining order, which prohibits defendants from making materially false and misleading statements to the court, and to appoint a receiver to determine whether to issue an injunction against further violations of Section 5(b).  In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting the defendants from violating the anti-SLAPP provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and that the SEC is continuing to investigate the matter.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to identify whether they are registered professionals."
