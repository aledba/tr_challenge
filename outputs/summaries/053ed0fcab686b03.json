  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana yesterday entered summary judgment against a former front desk clerk at the Kokomo Housing Authority for her alleged role in a 2014 misconduct that resulted in her being terminated.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that Angela Riley, a former KHA employee, was falsely blamed for an unapproved transfer of a KHA unit in 2010.  According to the complaint, Riley, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and frontal lobe seizures, was terminated on May 9, 2014, shortly after she requested and received a written warning from KHA informing her that she had been terminated because of her disability.  Riley also alleges that, in March 2014, KHA issued Riley a warning to her for failing to adhere to KHA procedures, conduct that Riley considered fraudulent, and terminated her after she complained to her supervisor about her actions.  In addition, Riley alleges that in May 2014, she was told that her employer had terminated her for not complying with KHA's requests for her leave, and that she should report the alleged misconduct to the civil-rights department.   Riley's complaint charges KHA with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Riley has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and orders Riley to comply with a court order requiring her to provide a copy of the complaint to be filed with the SEC.  She has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any type of disciplinary proceeding.  Finally, Riley's motion for summary judgment seeks to have the court order her to consent to the imposition of permanent injunctions, to prohibit her from associating with anyone with a history of misconduct, and to bar her from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 21, 2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Indiana Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
