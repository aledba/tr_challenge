  "summary": "On May 17, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Minnesota entered a final judgment against Ameron Water Transmission Group, LLC (\"Ameron\"), a South Dakota-based company that has agreed to pay $5.45 million to settle a civil action brought by Lewis & Clark Regional Water System.  The court's order, which was entered on May 22, 2016, permanently enjoins Ameron from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 1404(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14b-5 thereunder, and orders Ameron to pay a civil penalty of $1,350/day.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern Division of Minnesota today announced criminal charges against Carstensen Contracting, Inc. (\"Carstensen\").  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Minnesota, alleges that Lewis and Clark violated the first-filed rule by filing a complaint in the District of South Dakota, which requires a court to determine whether a defendant has a right to a fair trial.  According to the complaint, Lewis&Clark's complaint also alleges that Ameron violated the First-Filed Rule by failing to disclose material facts about the alleged violations in its contract with Lewis &Clark, and failed to file a complaint with the court.  Ameron's complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.    The Court's order also prohibits Ameron and Lewis& Clark from acting as unregistered broker-dealers in connection with any transfer of venue. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the SEC's Chicago Regional Office by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Justice's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-cv-1404 (D.C. Nov. 30, 2016).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Minnesota Office of Inspector General, and the Minnesota Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
