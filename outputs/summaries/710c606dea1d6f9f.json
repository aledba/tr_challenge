  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against Ohio State Trooper Robert W. Hartford, Jr., who conducted a routine traffic stop on a car driven at a high rate of speed in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The court found that Hartford had reasonable suspicion that Warfield was driving under the posted speed limit when, in reality, he was driving at a much slower rate.  According to the court's order, Warfield had recently exited a construction zone, requiring slower speeds, and had recently entered a temporary restraining order to halt his car.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Warfield.  On June 13, 2014, the court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered a conduct-based injunction, and ordered the officer to conduct a field sobriety test to determine whether Warfield violated the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Hartford consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,038, and imposes a $75,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael Gaddis, Kelly L. Gibson, and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Department of State Highway Patrol, and the Ohio State Department of Transportation."
