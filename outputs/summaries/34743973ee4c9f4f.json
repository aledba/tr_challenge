  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Crosses, finding that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The Court of Appeals also found that the defendants violated the pre-judgment provision of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, the defendants sought to establish that they and their predecessor-in-interest had used this same road continuously since 1953. The complaint alleges that, in 2014, Donnie and Donnie Cross used the road for a period of more than 15 years without interference from the Meltons. The SEC alleges that in 2013, after learning of the crosses' use of the road, Keen told him that he could stop them from using the road at any time.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the above-mentioned rule, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000 and a civil penalty of $5,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.  To learn more about this matter, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17, July 17, 2018."
