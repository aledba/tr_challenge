  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on June 8, 2018 entered a judgment of dissolution of marriage on the basis of fraud.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Michigan, alleges that, between 2000 and 2004, Robert Turfe and his wife, Summer Turfe, engaged in a fraudulent premarital marriage.  According to the complaint, the defendants agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 420 of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their respective property rights in the event of divorce.  In addition, the court found that, as a devout Muslim, he would never have married wife if he had known that she considered the mahr agreement purely symbolic and that she never intended to be bound by it.  As a result of the court\u2019s finding, the parties were not entitled to an annulment of the marriage based on fraud, and instead, entered into a judgment against them.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Turfe consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 420, and ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,038, which is equal to his civil penalty of $100,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $75,000, respectively.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  On June 9, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, seeking an injunction, an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, and an officer and director bar against Turfe. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.  For example, on June 7, 2017, a federal district court in California issued an order requiring the defendants to provide a copy of the Mahr agreement to their clients in order to determine whether they were entitled to the requisite amount of property to be entitled to a divorce.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendant.
