  "summary": "On May 22, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against two defendants in a related criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that they aided and abetted the violations of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 12(b)(5) and 13(c) thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants used their political power, their significant resources, and their expertise at operating within the corrupt climate of Colombia to avoid accountability for their roles in the criminal cases.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as alleged, Drummond provided substantial funding to the AUC and its predecessor organizations in Colombia.  Drummond also provided substantial assistance to the Colombian guerilla groups.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the Defendants violated the federal securities laws by failing to adequately disclose to the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida that Drummond and his companies were involved in a long-running criminal case that was ultimately settled by the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in this action, Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the securities laws, and order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against them from serving as officers or directors of a public company.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a second amended complaint against Drummond, this time alleging that he violated the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and that he was liable under Section 13 of the Exchange Act for aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  In a parallel action, on May 26, 2018 the U-S. Attorney's office for the Northern District of California unsealed criminal charges against the defendants.  This case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit, with assistance from Eric R. Werner of the Division of International Affairs, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay of the Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colombian Ministry of Justice in this matter."
