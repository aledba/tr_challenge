  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Fred Earl Ingerson III, who was convicted of capital murder for killing Robyn Richter and Shawna Ferris in the same transaction.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fort Worth on June 28, 2008, Ingerson was arrested for capital murder in 2008 for the murders.  The SEC alleges that, on the morning of the murders, Richter met Ingerson at a car show and asked him to go on a date with her. The complaint alleges that Ingerson agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a $1,500 civil penalty. Ingerson also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Ingerson. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an emergency court order freezing Ingerson's assets and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay a civil penalty, and pay disgorgement of $194,078, which is equal to the amount Ingerson has already paid in restitution to the victims.  On June 29, 2018, the SEC issued an order freezing the assets of Ingerson and Ferris and ordering them to be returned to their respective owners. The court also ordered Ingerson to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in the amount of $192,768, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC's investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Eric Werner and Ms. Werner. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Department for the Central District of Florida and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
