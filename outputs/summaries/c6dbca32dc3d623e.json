  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against Ante Nedlko Pavkovic in a civil injunctive action brought by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that, on 27 May 2017, the city of Charlotte issued a temporary restraining order and issued a cease-and-desist order, temporarily suspending him from participating in an anti-abortion event, and ordering him to pay double the court-imposed costs of his arrest for violating the noise ordinance.  According to the complaint, the order was issued in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 15(b) of the federal securities laws, and that the city had no reasonable suspicion to arrest defendant.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant repeatedly refused to comply with the city\u2019s orders to remove him from the abortion clinic.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, defendant failed to raise any objection at trial, and instead consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, imposes a $200,000 civil penalty, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions, and to a five-year officer-director bar, and ordered to pay a $1,500 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000, which is equal to the amount that he has already agreed to pay in the alternative.  On August 5, 2019, the Honorable Judge Hugh B. Lewis of the United States District Court in Charlotte issued an order suspending defendant from appearing, practicing, or participating in any public proceeding for the rest of his life.   The order also prohibits defendants from associating with any third party or organization that may be liable for a civil penalty.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-20 (2014).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against defendant. The SEC also announced that it would conduct an independent investigation into the matter and determine whether there is sufficient evidence to determine whether a defendant has violated the federal law.  Among other things, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the operation of the emergency response and response teams.  Finally, the court granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction against future violations and ordered the SEC to conduct a parallel investigation. "
