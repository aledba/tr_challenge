  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii today entered a final judgment against a Hawai'i-based radiologist who was convicted of felony assault in the third degree.  The court entered a temporary restraining order on June 15, 2018, freezing the defendant\u2019s assets and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  According to the court order, on September 22, 2014, Williams brought minor son Patrick Williams to Wahiawa General Hospital for treatment. Williams told the court that he had seen a \"obvious deformity\" in minor son's left femur and that Williams had appeared aloof at the hospital the night before. Williams also allegedly claimed that the x-rays were consistent with his diagnosis and examination of minor son. The court found that Williams was liable for a civil penalty of one year and ordered Williams to pay $2,500 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. Williams agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Central District of Hawai\u2018i today announced criminal charges against Williams.  On June 16, 2017, the Honorable Rebecca M. Welshhans granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 9 of the Exchange Act and Rules 9b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder, and granted the motion for an officer-and-director bar against Williams from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney. The order also prohibits Williams from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any medical device, including an MRI or CT scan, without admitting or denying the facts of the case. The SEC also barred Williams from serving as an officer or director of a public hospital for five years, and ordered him to be barred from practicing or practicing medicine in the future.  Williams consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws. The final judgment, which is pending final approval by the court, reserves the right to return the defendant to a jury at a later date. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa, Chief of the Public Health Unit. The Court will consider the merits of the judgment on July 24, 2018."
