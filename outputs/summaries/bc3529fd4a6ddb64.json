  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment in a workers' compensation case against Vincent Mastanduno, a truck driver who alleges that he was injured while moving a pallet during work and refused to cooperate with medical treatment authorized and paid for by the company.  The court found that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the company to seal the company\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation case file.  In its judgment, the court held that there was no statutory or constitutional right to seal a company's case file, and the company was not obligated to do so.  According to the judgment, Mastantuno consented to the entry of the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The judgment also imposes a $25,000 civil penalty against Mastandun, who has agreed to settle the case by consenting to entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the Exchange Act. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of Health and Human Services in this matter."
