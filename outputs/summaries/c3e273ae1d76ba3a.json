  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Keontae Kernall, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 12 months of community control.  According to the court's order, on June 13, 2018, Kernall pled guilty to one count of trafficking in cocaine, a felony of the fifth degree.  The court found that Kernall had violated the terms and conditions of his community control by failing to conduct himself properly by obtaining five new misdemeanor capiases, failing to report to the probation department on two separate occasions, and failing to show proof of employment verification.  In addition, the court ordered Kernall to submit to community control sanctions, which were specifically tailored to the defendant to address his problematic consumption of alcohol.  As alleged in the court order, however, the judge simply reimposed the original sentence for the underlying offense, which was contrary to law, and imposed a 12-month prison term on Kernall.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Court Order, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the community control provisions of the federal sentencing laws, and orders him to pay a penalty of 12 months in prison.  Kernall also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in any substance-abuse treatment program and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On October 16, 2019, the Ohio Court of Common Pleas entered a judgment against Kernall ordering him to comply with the requirements of the sentencing laws and imposing a 12 month prison sentence.  After a hearing on October 17, 2018 in the Hamilton County Adult Probation Department, the Court found Kernall guilty of violating community control and ordered him to complete substance abuse treatment as a part of a three-year sentence. The court also ruled that the amount of his sentence would be determined by the court at a later date upon motion of the court.   The Court's order also imposed a temporary restraining order preventing Kernall from making any further statements or actions concerning community control, including that he would not violate the mandatory sentencing provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court would not impose a penalty for the same conduct.  Additionally, the order imposed a six-month suspension of the defendant's ability to participate in community control activities, which would be subject to court approval.  To determine whether to revoke the suspension, a court order requires that the defendant submit to a \"judgment entry\" reflecting the facts presented in the complaint.
