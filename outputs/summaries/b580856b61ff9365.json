  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Montara Owners Assn. of Oregon, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Portland, Oregon, plaintiff suffered a head injury in a car accident in which he was driving.  The complaint alleges that, while plaintiff presented evidence of a permanent injury, he did not present any evidence that the injury was permanent.  As alleged in the complaint, the court improperly allowed the jury to consider the permanence of plaintiff\u2019s injuries and instructed the jury not to consider whether there was a likelihood of permanent injury.  In addition, the SEC alleges that plaintiff was in the 15 percent of people who suffer severe head injuries that last for a lifetime.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, plaintiff consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest.  Additionally, the judgment imposes a $25,000 civil penalty against Montara, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of the evidence in its case.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Marc Blau of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Ms. Barry, Ms. Bussman, and Mr. McCluskey. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
