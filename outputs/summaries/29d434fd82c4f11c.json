  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a defendant who failed to appear at a hearing in connection with a bail bond forfeiture case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Carlos Eduardo Chirinos violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from March 2015 through March 2016, the defendant failed to show up to a hearing on the subpoenaed records and failed to comply with the court's order to forfeit the bond.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that the defendant's nonappearance at the hearing constituted a \"lawfully required\" appearance at a court-related proceeding,\" and that the court did not lose jurisdiction over the forfeiture.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and a temporary asset freeze, and ordered the defendants to surrender their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest and pay a civil penalty in the amount of $50,000.  On March 28, 2016, a hearing was scheduled for the defendant to appear and the defendant did not show up.  After the hearing was adjourned for a reasonable period of time, the judge and jury deliberated for a total of three hours before issuing the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the charged provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d) of Securities Exchange Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13d-1 thereunder, and orders the defendants not to violate the charged sections of the securities laws.   The final judgment also prohibits the defendant from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer or representative of a public company, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock, other than for the purchase or sale of a security deposit in the name of a company or entity that is registered to sell or offer to sell the penny stock at a public offering of penny stock.  It also prohibits defendants from associating with a broker or offering to purchase penny stock for the purpose of acquiring or selling the security deposit at a publicly-traded brokerage firm. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U."
