  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a civil rights attorney who is charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 14, 2016, Kayheem Lilly, an attorney and solo practitioner, filed a complaint with the SEC alleging that New York City and its officers violated his right to an attorney\u2019s fee award based on the number of hours spent preparing a fee application and reply brief.  The complaint alleges that the complaint was filed in violation of the Administrative Rules of the Court, and that the District Court improperly imposed a ten percent fee increase on Rothman.  In its judgment, the court found that the reasonable hourly rate and reasonable hours billed were reasonable because they were incurred after the date of the offer of judgment when a paying client was willing to pay the fee.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Lilly consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Rothman from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his attorney's fees and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the New York State Attorney General's Office."
