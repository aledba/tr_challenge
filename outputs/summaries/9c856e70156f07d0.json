  "summary": "On January 8, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil penalty action brought by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, defendants agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, and agreed to pay a total of $16,800,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants consented to the entry of an order appointing an independent receiver to determine whether a penalty should be imposed based on the findings of the SEC's investigation, which was conducted by the Enforcement Division's Office of Enforcement, with the assistance of an administrative law judge.  As a result of the settlement, the defendants are entitled to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, and to the appointment of a receiver to conduct an independent review of the defendants' conduct.  Without admitting to the allegations in the SEC complaint, Defendants agreed to the imposition of permanent injunctions, to the issuance of a cease-and-desist order, to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains, to pay civil penalties, to be determined by the court at a later date.  Defendants also agreed to be enjoined from future securities laws violations.  On January 9, 2020, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court against Powhatan Energy Fund, LLC, alleging that it violated Section 31 of the Exchange Act.  It also charged the defendants with violating Section 10b of Exchange Act Section 10-b, and Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and Rule 13b2-2 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint also alleges that Defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (d) the Administrative Procedure Act of 1940 (\"Advisers\") by failing to comply with certain of the provisions of the Rules of Civil Procedure, and that Defendants failed to adequately disclose to the Commission that they had engaged in a fraudulent scheme that resulted in the Commission imposing a penalty of over $1 million,000,000 on each of them.  Finally, Defendants have agreed to a preliminary injunction prohibiting them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security"
