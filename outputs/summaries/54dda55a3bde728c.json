  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Steven Petersen, a former school district employee who suffered a back injury while working for the Granite School District.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, on November 10, 1982, a 500-pound cast iron boiler door fell onto an injured Granite school employee.  The complaint alleges that, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Petersen agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains his right to temporary total disability compensation for work missed following a workplace accident. The judgment also prohibits Petersen from seeking compensation for a period of eight years from the date of the injury. The complaint also alleges that the federal district attorney's office (\"ALJ\") denied Mr. Petersen's motion for a hearing before the Commission, which was certified by the SEC. The SEC's final judgment, which entered final judgment on the merits of the case, orders Petersen to pay a civil penalty in the amount of 312 weeks of compensation. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the Utah Attorney General's Office (AGO) today announced criminal charges against Petersen arising from the same conduct alleged in Stoker. The AGO's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Fraud Task Force. The litigation will be led by Eric R. Werner and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Utah Office of Insurance Regulation."
