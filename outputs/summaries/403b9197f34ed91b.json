  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio today announced criminal charges against Timothy Workman.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on September 30, 2013, Celina, Ohio officers executed a search warrant on the residence of Workman, a convicted felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Workman and his wife, Amanda On, were living at the residence at the time of the search when they discovered the firearms and ammunition.  On the morning of the arrest, the officers searched the house and found a Taurus \"Judge\" model revolver capable of shooting both.410 and.45 caliber ammunition, and a loaded.22 caliber Taurus \u201cTracker\u201d model revolver.  Workman denied the allegations in the complaint and consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to the imposition of a civil penalty.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court denied Workman\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered him to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  To settle the SEC case, the defendant agreed to a permanent injunction, to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, to a five-year conduct-based injunction, and from participating in any future securities offering or offering of a penny stock.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
