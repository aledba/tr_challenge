  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Saks, Inc. and its corporate parent, Hudson's Bay Company, in an amended complaint alleging that Saks violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1404(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 14b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's amended complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, on April 1, 2018, Saks disclosed that hackers had placed malware on Saks' retail systems in order to collect customer payment card information, including cardholder name, payment card number and expiration dates, when shoppers used their credit and debit cards at its Tennessee-based stores.  According to the complaint, the data breach was enabled by Saks's security failures and failure to abide by best practices and industry standards concerning the security of payment systems.  Saks has established that all such evidence is located in the New York-based district where it is located.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requiring Saks to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 24, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in the U. S. District court for the southern district of Tennessee, charging Saks with violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 14(c) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 14b2-2 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting the defendants' violations of Rule 13b2(a).  The complaint also charged Saks as a defendant in connection with a related action brought by the SEC in the Central District of California, which was investigated by the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit.
