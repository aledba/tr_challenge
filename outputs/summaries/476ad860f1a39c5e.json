  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former National Secretary-Treasurer for defrauding members of the AFGE National Executive Council.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that on November 15, 2016, Eugene Hudson, then-N.Y. Secretary of State, sent an email to thousands of AFGE members warning of a likely future attack on organized labor by President-elect Donald Trump and the new Republican-controlled Congress.  According to the complaint, Hudson's e-mail included a post-election tweet that he claimed was a \"Master Grifter\" who could blow $800,000 overbudget and accuse others of fiscal irresponsibility.\"  The complaint further alleges that Hudson had previously filed a complaint against him alleging that he had acted in a way unbecoming a union member while at a local meeting.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hudson has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,038,767, which he has already paid in the form of a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending Hudson from appearing before the Commission as an impartial arbiter in the case.  On November 24, 2017, the SEC filed an enforcement action against Hudson, charging him with violating Section 17(a) of its Securities Act of 1933 and Exchange Act Rules 17a-1 and 17b2-3 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against Hudson.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-11 (Feb. 26, 2018).  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael G. Sansone and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
