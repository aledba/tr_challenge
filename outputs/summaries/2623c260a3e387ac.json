  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Reliance Standard Life Insurance Company (\"Reliance\"), a medical biller, for violating the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\").  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Julissa Bradshaw worked for Pyramid Healthcare Solutions, Inc., an insurance company that offered her both short-term and long-term disability benefits. Bradshaw was a few weeks pregnant when she suffered a stroke.  The complaint alleges that Reliance improperly applied a pre-existing condition exclusion to Bradshaw's benefit plan, which Reliance denied because of insufficient evidence to support its claim.  In its complaint, Reliance also alleged that Bradshaw had a preeclampsia, high blood pressure, or stroke during the look-back period, and that she received treatment for pregnancy and stroke during this time.  Reliance's complaint charges Bradshaw with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Reliance Board of Directors agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Reliance from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty and a $500,000 penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center, with assistance from John Rymas, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
