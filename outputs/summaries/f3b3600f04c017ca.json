  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Thomas Hubbard, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in a bank robbery.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that, on February 28, 2016, Hubbard and Capote met with Capote, Capote's brother-in-law, De'Vontae Bates, and another member of the same gang who had been convicted of capital murder for the same crime. Capote allegedly told Hubbard that he had seen Capote commit the felony and that he believed Capote had the intent to commit the capital murder. According to the complaint, Hubbard also allegedly told Capote that Capote \"wearing a stocking cap, sunglasses, and a sweatsuit\" when Capote told him to lay low and \"keep quiet.\" Capote also allegedly claimed that he \"saw Ben kill KJ and two black guys wit him.\" The complaint further alleges that the defendant had cut his hair before the crime and did not tell Capote or Capote what he had done. The complaint charges Capote with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Department of Criminal Justice."
