  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against Southern Aggregates, LLC, a Louisiana-based company that was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, alleges that from October 2014 through January 2017, Southern Aggregate, LLC (\"Save Our Hills\"), filed an application for an initial minor source air permit to construct and operate a sand and gravel mine in the Oak Hills Subdivision of Louisiana.  According to the complaint, the application for the permit was based on a number of factors, including the fact that the proposed site was substantially complete at the time of the application.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the application relied on a cost benefit analysis that included the potential and economic benefits of the project, and failed to consider the impact on neighboring landowners on the site.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0On November 22, 2016, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct an independent review of the matter.  On November 24, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in the Northern District of New Orleans, alleging that the SEC failed as a public trustee of the environment when it issued a final permit for a sand-and-grass mining project in Oak Hills, Louisiana. The complaint also alleged that Southern Aggregation failed to adequately consider the social and economic costs of the proposed project when performing its environmental cost analysis.  As set forth in the Complaint, the Court found that LDEQ violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by failing to consider all of the relevant facts of the case presented in the Commission's opinion, including that the Commission failed to take reasonable steps to balance the economic and social benefits with the potential environmental costs to neighboring landowners."
