  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Asphalt Professionals, Inc. (\"APPLE\") and its owner, T.O. IX, LLC (\"TOS\"), for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, the defendants entered into an agreement with TOS in 2004 that required them to pay $1.34 million in attorneys' fees to the prevailing party in an action arising out of a breach of contract action.  The complaint alleges that TOS violated the contract by failing to comply with certain provisions of the agreement, including the right to a reasonable attorney's fees provision, and that Davis was not a party to the agreement.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, TOS consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $831,018. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In its judgment, the court held that Davis, as a prevailing party, had a duty to enforce the terms of the agreements and that he had a right to collect reasonable attorney fees from the parties. The court also ordered TOS to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
