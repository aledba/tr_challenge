  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a settlement that permanently enjoins the developers from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, in 2017, Andre Yates filed an application with the city for thirty-eight variances and thirty-three waivers to permit him to develop a 25-unit apartment building in the Van Wyck Brooks Historic District.  According to the complaint, the request was based on the fact that the property was in the historic district and was zoned for residential use.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Yates failed to disclose that he purchased the property in 2012 for $100,000, knowing that the building was likely to service some PTSD sufferers.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Yates agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,500, which would be offset by a $1,500 civil penalty.  On August 13, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction against the development of a second apartment building, and ordered Yates to submit a full accounting of the costs and benefits of the second apartment project.   The court's order also temporarily halted the construction of the third apartment building on the property, pending final approval by the federal district court for the southern district of New Jersey. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David C. Hershfang and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
