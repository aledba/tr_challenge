  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a temporary restraining order against a Lynnwood, Wash., police officer who allegedly conducted a search and seizure of a motor vehicle.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that, in a routine patrol, Lynnwood officers observed a silver vehicle enter a parking lot and park in a stall. According to the complaint, the officers asked the driver of the vehicle whether he had a driver\u2019s license and whether he was in possession of a drug pipe. The officer replied, without admitting or denying the allegations, that he had not. The complaint further alleges that the officers followed the vehicle and followed it into an alley behind a building, where they observed a car parked in a tight spot. The officers then entered the car and began to search the vehicle. The court found that, at the time of the seizure, neither officer had a reasonable suspicion of a seizure and neither officer could move his vehicle in reverse without risking his car making contact with one or both of the officers.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Washington today announced criminal charges against the officer. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against the officers, charging them with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-officer injunctions against future violations of the federal securities laws. The case is being handled by John Rymas of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer Chun Barry and Ms. Chun Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the Inspector General of the Northern District of California."
