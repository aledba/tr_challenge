  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment in favor of the university's motion to dismiss its defamation action against two former students accused of making false and misleading statements to campus security.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, in fall 2011, Eva Walkuski and Ariel Zekelman were students at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) when they were allegedly sexually assaulted by a member of the SAIC student body.  According to the complaint, after learning of the alleged misconduct, Walkuski and Zekelmann filed a complaint with the SEC alleging that they were entitled to absolute privilege because they reported the misconduct to the university.  As alleged, however, the SEC's order did not apply to all allegations of sexual assault or misconduct.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the complaint was filed in the context of an investigation and disciplinary hearing that flowed from the reports.  In a parallel action, on May 3, 2017, a federal district court in Illinois entered a temporary restraining order against Walkuskii and Zeiselman, who were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Evelin M. Clay and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Clay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the Illinois Department of State Office of Inspector General in this matter."
