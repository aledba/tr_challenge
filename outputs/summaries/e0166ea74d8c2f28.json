  "summary": "On April 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against two Arkansas parents, Malisa Phillips and Wayne Phillips, for terminating their parental rights to two children, EP (born June 3, 2001) and CP (born February 3, 2008).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, the court found that the parents violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder.  The complaint alleges that the court improperly terminated the parental rights of both parents because there was insufficient evidence to support the termination or that the termination was in the children's best interest.  Malisa also alleges that, contrary to the court's finding, the parents were unable to provide safe, stable, clean housing for the children.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the parents.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the New York Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Enforcement's Criminal Justice Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Widner and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Missouri Department of Education, the Alabama Department of Insurance, the Mississippi Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
