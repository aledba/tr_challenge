  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Nevada today entered a final judgment against Carlin Resources, LLC (\"Carlin\"), a mining company based in Elko County, Nevada, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Las Vegas on April 19, 2016, Carlin and Silvey raised the issue of whether Carlin had a right to ongoing consultation on eligibility determinations for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.  The complaint alleges that Carlin failed to show that it had any reasonable standing to bring a claim under the project PA, and that the BLM's April 2016 decision affected Carlin's ability to proceed on the mining project.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.

Investors can also use\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's investor.gov website\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify investors who may be at risk of losing their investment.  For example, the SEC previously charged Carlin with fraud in connection with its participation and consultation in a mining project that was ultimately approved by the BLM.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions, orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,078.95, and imposes a civil penalty of $100,000.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Nevada Secretary of State's Office, and the Nevada Department of Natural Resources."
