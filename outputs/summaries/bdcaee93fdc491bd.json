  "summary": "On January 4, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California entered a final judgment against CitiMortgage, Inc., a California-based mortgage servicer, and its successor in interest, United States Bank National Association (USBNA).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Sacramento, California, on August 11, 2014, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  The court also granted the defendants the right to a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from imposing any duty of care on a borrower.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On January 24, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Among other things, the case was investigated by the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, which conducted an examination of the borrower and found that the borrower was in a vulnerable position by failing to timely and carefully process loan modification applications.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a $10,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Marc Blau and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Banking and Securities, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
