  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the California Department of Environmental Quality (CEQA) against ARB for failing to comply with its obligations under the federal regulations.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles on January 5, 2016, ARB violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The complaint alleges that ARB failed to adequately assess the impact of increased use of biodiesel on California's air quality, and failed to adopt a proper baseline for the project.  ARB also failed to disclose that the 2014 baseline for biodiesel emissions was not sufficient to determine whether the project would have a significant adverse effect on the environment.  In a parallel action, the California Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has obtained a court order suspending ARB from violating the federal securities laws.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Los Angeles Regional Office and the Office of Environmental Education and Advocacy. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
