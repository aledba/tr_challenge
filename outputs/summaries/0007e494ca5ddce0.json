  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who died while awaiting trial on a charge of reckless homicide.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 31, 2014, Hassan Falah Al Mutory, the defendant in this case, pulled out a gun and fired three times at a party-goer. The complaint alleges that the court erred by admitting a recorded interview at trial and, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, that there was insufficient evidence to determine whether the defendant was guilty.  The complaint further alleges that, as a result of the defendant\u2019s death, the Court of Criminal Appeals did not consider the merits of the defendants\u2019 appeals.  In its judgment, the court held that the doctrine of abatement ab initio applies only to criminal defendants who have died during the pendency of a criminal proceeding, not to defendants who are already sentenced to prison. The court also ruled that the right to appeal as of right does not end when a defendant dies, and that a judgment cannot be imposed upon the defendant until the defendant has died.  On November 1, 2017, the SEC filed an emergency action against the defendant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a $12 million civil penalty.  Without further explanation, the complaint charges Mutory with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgment of illusory gains, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Timothy Razel and supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Alexander F. Mindlin. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Tennessee Department of Criminal Justice."
