  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former train conductor and brakeman for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in late 2015, John Guerra, Jr. worked as a train conductor for Consolidated Rail Corporation (\u201cConrail\u201d) and complained that he failed to timely file a timely administrative complaint with the Department of Labor.  According to the complaint, Guerra was told that he needed to file a complaint by mid-January and that he would be suspended for 45 days.  In reality, as the complaint alleges, the complaint was filed by Guerra\u2019s lawyers, Lawrence Katz and Robert Myers, and was not subject to the mandatory 90-day limitations period required by federal law.  As the complaint further alleges, in early 2016 Guerra filed six complaints about allegedly defective braking systems in two Conrail locomotives. Yet again, the only response was to toe the company line for his own good.   The complaint also alleges that Conrail threatened Guerra and threatened him and eliminated certain incidental perks of his job.  On the same day, the SEC issued an order suspending Guerra from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the company consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the company to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  Finally, the court entered a temporary restraining order against Guerra on May 10, 2016, that temporarily enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to comply with the court-ordered injunction against further violations of Section 13(a) and 13(b)(2)(A) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  It also orders Guerra to pay $5,000 in disgorgment, $1,500 in prejudgment interests, and a $10,000 civil penalty.  Conrail has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction, which is subject to court approval.  This settlement is pending final approval by the SEC, which will determine the amount and severity of the injunctive relief ordered by the Court.
