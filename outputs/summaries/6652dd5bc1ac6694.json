  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of two felony vehicular homicide charges and sentenced to two consecutive five-year terms of incarceration.  The court's order, which was entered on April 10, 2011, found that defendant William T. Liepe, a fifty-eight-year-old New Jersey resident, had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") for the purpose of imposing consecutive terms of imprisonment. The court also found that Liepe violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws, and that he was liable to be sentenced to a mandatory minimum of five years in prison.  Liepe also was found liable to a five year term for second-degree aggravated assault.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Liepe.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in New Jersey, Liepe pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree manslaughter, which resulted in the death of one of his victims, and was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, with a three-year officer-and-director bar and a four-year prison term for the other defendant.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws and requires them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders Liepe to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David A. Schiff and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey State Attorney General's Office, and the U.N. Office of Inspector General in this matter."
