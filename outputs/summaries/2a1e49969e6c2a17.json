  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the California Department of Justice against them.  The SEC's complaint, filed on April 4, 2012, alleges that James and Maureen Colton, of Ripon, California, harassed, intimidated, and annoyed their neighbor, Jillian Knudsen, by making verbal threats, threatening to harm her family and guest invitees, and loading and pointing a shotgun at Kamps.  According to the complaint, the defendants also engaged in an aggressive and premeditated campaign to prevent and abetted their neighbor's violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in a series of aggressive and aggressive actions, including driving erratically and at an excessive rate of speed down Huse Road, and repeatedly destroying speed bumps and other signs along the way.  On at least 30 occasions, defendants have threatened to harm their neighbor or family members and threatened to shoot their dogs with their shotguns.  Last week, a federal district court in San Diego entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants, freezing their assets, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to comply with the court's order, and imposes a $25,000 civil penalty against each defendant, and orders the defendants to pay a $50,000 penalty.  Finally, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval, for the purpose of recovering the allegedly harmed property.   The court also granted the parties' request for an injunction against further violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, and for a civil penalty of $75,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Los Angeles Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson."
