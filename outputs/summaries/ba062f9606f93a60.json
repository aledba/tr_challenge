  "summary": "On June 21, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Colorado entered a final judgment against a Colorado-based emergency medicine expert for his role in a 2014 medical malpractice case.  According to the court's order, on February 9, 2016, Dr. Lesley A. Fraser of Aspen, Colorado, filed a Comparative Negligence Motion to Strike Dr. Ken Zafren, M.D., alleging that he failed to adequately assess the efficacy of tPA as a frostbite treatment.  Fraser's motion, filed in federal district court in Denver, alleges that, in February 2016, Fraser submitted an affirmative defense of comparative negligence to a Colorado court finding that he was not qualified to provide a standard-of-care opinion for severe frostbite.  The court ruled that Fraser was entitled to an order requiring him to provide expert testimony on the basis of his own experience with frostbite prevention.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Fraser consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the Colorado Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Fraser arising from the same conduct Fraser is alleged to have engaged in in.  On May 21, 2018, the court granted the motion for summary judgment against Fraser, which is subject to court approval, and ordered that the court consider the merits of the action against Fraser.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-64-401 (Dec. 21, 2016).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a medical device using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's complaint charges Fraser with violating Rule 12b-20, Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder of the federal securities laws, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a conduct-based injunctive relief.   The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and seeks a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 15(b)(5) and (c) of\u00c2\u00a0the Exchange Act and Rules 15b-8, 13a-1, and (e)"
