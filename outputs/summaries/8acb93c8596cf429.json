  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against USCIS, the Department of Homeland Security, and individual officers in charge of enforcing the agency's new policy.  The SEC's complaint alleges that USCIS violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that, in violation of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, USCIS failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its decision-making process.  According to the complaint, the USCIS policy, which USCIS adopted in February 2018, requires that a court determine whether a person is eligible for long-term foster care, and requires the court to determine whether the person has a reasonable basis for reunification with their biological parents.  In addition, the complaint alleges USCIS has failed to consider the merits of its new policy when it issued its guidance in August 2017, when it denied a request for a temporary restraining order against the issuance of an order requiring a court to make SIJ determinations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, which was filed in federal district court in San Diego, California, the court granted USCIS a preliminary injunction and ordered USCIS to comply with the court's order. The court also issued a final order requiring USCIS and individual officer-and-director certifications of all USCIS-related administrative proceedings.  USCIS also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $20,000.  Additionally, the Court issued a temporary injunction, which prohibits USCIS from issuing or denying any SIJ-related enforcement action, and issued an order suspending USCIS's enforcement of the new policy for a period of 180 days. The order also orders USCIS not to violate the pre-clearance provisions of the federal criminal laws, and USCIS will not be liable for civil penalties in the event of a court finding that it has jurisdiction to determine SIJ status for specific individuals under the age of 18.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert Cowan granted the SEC's request for an emergency court order halting USCIS' pending enforcement action against J.L. Bennet, a California resident who was previously barred from serving as an officer and director of a public agency. The Court granted the request for emergency court approval of the emergency court's action against Bennet. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the San Diego Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms."
