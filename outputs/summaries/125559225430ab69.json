  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment in favor of the Illinois Secretary of State's Office (\"Secretary of State\") finding that Evanston residents and registered voters had the right to participate in a municipal election by filing a petition to remove the EVI from the ballot.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on December 16, 2019, the Illinois secretary of state's office issued an order requiring the secretary of State to file a petition in order to place the \"Evanston Voter's Initiative\" on the ballot for the upcoming municipal election.  The SEC's order, which was entered by the court on January 15, 2020, alleges that the secretary-treasurer, the mayor, and a member of the city's board of directors failed to adequately consider the issues raised in the petition.  In addition, the court found that the Secretary-Treasurer's Office improperly handled the matter of whether or not an EVI was authorized by statute or provided for in the Illinois Constitution.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Secretary Secretary's Office has agreed to the entry of an order that permanently enjoins the Secretary from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, and 16a-20 thereunder, and orders the Secretary to comply with the requirements of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and Rules 17a-1 and 17a through\u00c2\u00a0\u00a7\u00c2\u00a010(b)(5)(A) thereunder. The order also prohibits the Secretary of the State from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any municipal securities, and from making any recommendation to a municipal board as to whether to approve or reject a municipal bond issue. The court's order also requires the secretary to provide a copy of the proposed bond issue to the board.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order halting the issuance of the bond issue, freezing the Secretary's and Treasurer's assets, and imposing a $10,000 civil penalty.  On January 16, 2020 the court issued a final order against the Secretary and Treasurer of Illinois, ordering them to submit a petition for approval by public referendum within 30 days of the date of the public announcement of the decision. The board's order granted the request for an injunction against further violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordered the secretary and treasurer to submit an order appointing a receiver to oversee the issuance and sale of the bonds. The SEC also ordered the auditor to conduct a background check on each of the applicants."
