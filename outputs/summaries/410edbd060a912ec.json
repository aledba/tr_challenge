  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a custody action brought by the District Court against him for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Shane Nebeker, a supervisor at a coal mine, and Trisha Ann Orton, a mother of three, violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by failing to provide sufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s finding that Mother and Father should have primary custody of a child.  According to the complaint, Father and Mother agreed to a temporary custody arrangement under which Child would be placed in full-time day care with the other parent, and Father would have primary physical custody of Child.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Utah today announced criminal charges against Father.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, Father consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar.  Father also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David A. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Office of Recovery Services, the Utah Department of Justice, and the Utah Division of Criminal Justice."
