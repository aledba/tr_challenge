  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the developer of a proposed bridge over the Santa Clara River.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, the California Secretary of State's Office issued an order on October 15, 2012 requiring the state to file a writ of mandate with the court.  The SEC alleges that the California secretary of state issued the order without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In its order, the court also issued a temporary restraining order halting the construction of the bridge, which the SEC alleges violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder.  On November 2, 2013, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York unsealed criminal charges against the defendant.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, the defendant and his company, Wishtoyo Foundation/Ventura Coastkeeper, falsely claimed that the court would determine whether the project was in compliance with the federal environmental laws.  Instead, the complaint alleges, the judge and the developer consented to the issuance of the order, which is subject to the court's approval. The court also agreed to the appointment of a receiver to supervise the filing of an environmental impact report. The receiver will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  Finally, the receiver has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which will be offset by a $50,000 officer-and-director bar and a $75,000 penny stock bar.  To learn more about the receiver's responsibilities, see Litigation Release Release No. 17-cv-01-17.
