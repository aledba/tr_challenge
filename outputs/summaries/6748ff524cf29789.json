  "summary": "On January 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered final consent judgments against Charles Company and System, LLC, a Los Angeles-based real estate developer, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered consent judgments in favor of the developer and against the City of West Hollywood.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in West Hollywood, California, on January 20, 2019, the California Department of Water Resources (EIR) issued an order requiring the city to submit a draft Environmental Quality Act (EQA) for approval of a project that would preserve the 9080 Building and allow the development of a 94,000-square-foot residential building.  In its order, the court entered consent judgment against the city, ordering the EIR to be reviewed and approved by the agency.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the city consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the city from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders the City to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The court granted the City's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered the demolition of existing buildings, and ordered the building to be replaced with a new building. The Commission's order also prohibits the destruction or alteration of any building, other than the one currently planned for the site, and requires the construction of an internal courtyard and pedestrian paseo to facilitate access to the site.  On January 21, 2020, the Commission issued a final order granting the City the right to proceed with the proposed EIR. The order also requires the Commission to consider the pros and cons of the proposed project, including the impact on the environment, the adequacy of the Commission\u2019s findings, and the appropriateness of the recommendations in its order.  For further information, see Environmental Quality Action Council v. City of Los Angeles (2014).  The Commission has also issued a preliminary injunction against the destruction of any buildings or structures that may be used as part of a public project.  To learn more about how to spot signs of an EIR violation, see California Environmental Quality Assn. v. San Diego (2014) and Cal.App.4th 1336, 937, 45 Cal.Rptr.3d 102).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the two men accused of orchestrating a scheme to demolish a historic building."
