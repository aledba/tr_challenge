  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment against a former Polk County clerk of court for abusing her discretion in granting her attorney fees and expenses.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Des Moines, alleges that on July 12, 2016, the district court granted Lee a temporary restraining order and ordered her to pay $241,700.05 in fees and $4903.87 in expenses incurred since February 18, 2008, for a total of $145,942.65.  In its order, the court found that Lee violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Lee was entitled to an award of attorney fees based on the number of successful and unsuccessful claims for relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Lee consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders the court to determine whether it is appropriate to award her an attorney fee.  Lee agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and prejudgment interest.  On August 22, Lee filed a second application for attorney fees, this time for a partial reinstatement.  According to the SEC's order, Lee failed to name any state official in her original action, questioned whether lost wages and benefits constituted prospective relief, and questioned whether she had sufficient evidence to prove her entitlement to prospective relief. The court also found Lee had insufficient evidence to show that she had reasonable evidence to support her claim.  Finally, the SEC alleges that Lee had failed to show sufficient evidence in her application to justify a monetary injunction and that the court had abused its discretion in not granting her a partial injunction. The SEC also alleges Lee had violated the anti-fraud provision of Section 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933.  It further alleges Lee violated Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 10b2-1 and 13a-11 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgements, and other relief against Lee.  To settle the SEC case, Lee has agreed to a settlement where she will be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2016).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis."
