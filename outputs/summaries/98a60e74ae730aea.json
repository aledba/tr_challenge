  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against defendant Joshua K. Armstrong for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, Armstrong was charged with three counts of statutory sodomy, six counts of attempted first-degree statutory sodomization, one count of attempted second-degree child molestation, and two counts of third-degree criminal sodomy.  The complaint alleges that Armstrong told victims that he touched their genitals and tried to get them to touch his penis.  He also allegedly told one victim that he would \"touch her vagina and her breasts\" when she was asleep in a recliner chair at Armstrong\u2019s apartment.  Armstrong also allegedly asked the victim to place her hand on his penis, which he did not do.  As alleged in the complaint, however, Armstrong did not touch her vagina or breasts, and instead attempted to get her to touch him.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Armstrong.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Armstrong consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar on Armstrong, for a total of two hundred and twenty-five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Stoltz and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
