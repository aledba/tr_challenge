  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Illinois yesterday entered summary judgment in favor of the city of Springfield in a related criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, in August 2015, John E. Murphy was riding his bicycle on the Interurban Trail when he was hit by a bollard that was missing.  According to the complaint, Murphy, who was the assistant superintendent of parks and planning at the time of Murphy's accident, claimed that he was aware of a recurring dangerous condition on the bike path.  Murphy also alleged that, while riding his bike on the trail, Murphy allegedly hit a piece of metal in the middle of the path and was thrown from his bike.  As alleged, Murphy's injuries were not life-threatening, but Murphy's was permanently injured.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Murphy.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Murphy consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, plus prejudgment interest of $2,037, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-20-20, 2017. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov.
