  "summary": "On January 10, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Michael Bryant, finding him guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Wheeling, W.Va., alleges that Bryant violated the statutory duties incumbent upon a driver who has been involved in an automobile accident.  According to the complaint, Bryant failed to provide the required information to a police officer at the scene of an accident, even though he knew that the officer was going to call the police.  Bryant also failed to inform Everhardt that he had taken a photograph of his license-plate number.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against Bryant.  On January 9, 2019, the court of appeals issued an order suspending Bryant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Bryant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also ordered Bryant to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078 plus prejudgment interest of $2,037, and a $100,000 civil penalty.  As part of the settlement, Bryant also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the company's name, address, and telephone number. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 1798-1, and No. 206-2, 2018 WL 4490919. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Department of Public Safety, and the Ohio State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
