  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama today entered a final judgment against George Martin, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to death in 2000 for the murder of his wife, Hammoleketh Martin.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Mobile, Ala., Martin was convicted in 2000 of the capital murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.  The SEC alleges that Martin was the only defendant ever to be convicted of a capital murder, and that Martin had no memory of the events leading up to the murder.  Martin also allegedly told the court that he had never seen a gas can in the car and that he \"filled up the car.\"  The complaint further alleges that, while incarcerated before his original trial, Martin was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Martin consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the Alabama Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Martin arising from the same conduct that led to Martin's conviction.  On May 8, 1997, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against Martin and ordered him to appear before the SEC as a witness in a case that was being handled by the SEC Enforcement Division's Office of Professional and Risk Analysis. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of the United States Attorney's Office, with assistance from John Rymas, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Ms. Broach and Mr. Martin. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Office of Inspector General."
