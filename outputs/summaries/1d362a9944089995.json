  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against JetSuite, Inc. (JetSuite), a California-based private jet manufacturer, and its subsidiary, Flying Tiger Line, Inc., a Florida-based company that operated an on-demand \"air taxi\" service.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, Jetsuite claimed that California had the right to impose a property tax on the full value of its jets in tax year 2011, even though those jets had not yet made a landing in the state.  The complaint further alleges that the California Department of Revenue assessed personal property taxes on all six jets at 1 percent of their full value and, in 2011, the County of Los Angeles (County) assessed the same amount at the same time.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this was not sufficient to establish a situs over the jets.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in 2010, one of those jets flew to 309 different airports in 42 different states and six different countries.  JetSuites calculated that this aircraft spent 60.88 percent of its time in California, and other states and countries conferred \"benefits and protection\" upon it by providing fire and other protection services at their airports.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the California Board of Equalization (BCE) issued a written order rejecting the Commission\u2019s motion for an administrative writ of mandamus, ordering the Commission to conduct a full accounting of all of the jet assets in its jurisdiction, and imposing a $89,839 civil penalty.   The Commission has also issued an order suspending the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission is continuing its investigation, which is continuing to be conducted by the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force.
