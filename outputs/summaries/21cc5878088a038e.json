  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on June 12, 2017, entered a final judgment against Yacht Club, Inc., a registered representative of the Erie-Western Pennsylvania Port Authority, and its appraiser, Robert Glowacki, in a parallel action.  The court's order, which entered the final judgment on June 13, 2018, enjoins Yacht from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Yacht to pay $635,200 in real estate taxes and $342,550 in property taxes.  According to the SEC's complaint, the defendants failed to show sufficient evidence to overcome the Board's prima facie case, and instead relied on the inflated valuation of the property.  In its judgment, the court held that Yacht was entitled to a fair market value based on its leasehold interest, and that it had the right to determine the value of the real estate at the time of its valuation.  Yacht also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, which is equal to the amount of its real estate tax paid to the Board of Assessment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Yacht and the school district consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, as well as from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any real estate investment, including, without limitation, the issuance of a civil injunctive relief, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar. The court also granted Yacht's request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the company and prohibiting it from acquiring, renovating, or selling any of the properties on which it has located, and ordering the company to pay an $8,283,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
