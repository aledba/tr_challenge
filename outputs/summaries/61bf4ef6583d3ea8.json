  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Kentucky doctor who was convicted of unlawfully prescribing controlled substances in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, from March 2011 to January 2012, Dr. Alan Godofsky worked at a \"pill mill\" clinic in Georgetown, Kentucky, where he routinely prescribed opioid-based painkillers without performing any medical examination, discussing risks or alternatives, obtaining informed consent, or ordering follow-up monitoring. According to the complaint, the clinic had thousands of patients, many of whom had traveled long distances and waited for hours for a few minutes with a doctor who would then provide a prescription for a large amount of opioids, usually oxycodone. The complaint further alleges that the clinic was a \"seedy, filthy place\" where patients were not honestly seeking and relying upon his services as a physician. The court found that, for the defendant to be guilty of the charges, he had to show that he had acted in good faith in dispensing the drugs, that he knew at the time of distribution that the substance was a controlled substance, and that he did not violate the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $500,000. The judgment also prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization and from participating in any offering of a penny stock. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kentucky Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
