  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a New York-based company and its principal in connection with Michael Myers's death.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, alleges that Arkansas Steel Associates, LLC and its parent companies violated the exclusive-benefits provision of the federal workers' compensation law.  According to the complaint, Michael Myers was employed as a ladle man in a steel plant when a load of molten metal spilled from a Hot Metal Crane inside the Melt Shop of the plant. The complaint alleges that while Michael Myers worked in the course and scope of his employment for the company, the molten metal engulfed his entire body causing, among other things, catastrophic injuries and death. The SEC further alleges that the parent companies were not, in fact, third parties, and that the defendants were third parties.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Michael Myers and his wife, Mary Myers, received death benefits from their employer, but were not entitled to employer immunity because they were not \"employers\" under the federal laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Myers consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, \u00a7 11-9-105(a) (Supp. 2017).  The complaint also names Yamato Kogyo Corporation of Americas d/b/a Sumitomo Corporation of America, Inc., as a defendant in a tort action arising from Michael Myers' work-related death, and as a control person in a civil action against the parent company for liability arising from Myers's alleged workplace negligence.  On May 2, 2018, the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Arkansas entered a final order permanently enjoining the defendants from violating the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $150,000 each, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest of $50,000, and imposing civil penalties against each of them.  Finally, the court entered a temporary restraining order against Michael Myers, ordering him to return to the company he was previously employed with, and ordered him to pay $10.00, which he did not pay, in the amount of $1,500. The court also issued an order suspending the defendants'"
