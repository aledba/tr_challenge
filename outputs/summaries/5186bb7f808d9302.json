  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania-based medical doctor who was not qualified to testify as an expert witness in a medical malpractice case.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Paul Sedacca, M.D., a board-certified general practitioner, who was also a medical expert.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Wright was injured in a motor vehicle accident on January 5, 2014. The court ruled that Dr. Sedacca was unqualified to offer his opinion about the nature of Wright's injuries, the cause of those injuries, Wright's treatment, and prognosis, and that he was severely prejudiced by the court's decision not to grant him a new trial on damages.  In its judgment, the court found that Wright did not suffer impermissible prejudice as a result of the preclusion of his sole medical expert at trial.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Wright consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $8,896.44 in medical expenses and $55,000 for his medical expenses.  On the same day, the trial court again denied Wright's motion for a hearing on damages, this time on the basis of a finding that he did not have sufficient expertise or experience to provide a credible medical perspective to support his claim.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Office of Emergency Management, and the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
