  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Shelly Diane McMillan and her husband for their roles in an alleged child custody fraud.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, the defendants had a tumultuous relationship fueled by alcohol and substance abuse.  The complaint alleges that, from at least 2010 through at least 2016, the parties engaged in a series of child custody actions, including one that terminated the jurisdiction of a federal district court for child custody.  As alleged in the complaint, these actions resulted in the parties losing custody of the child.  In one of these actions, the court entered a temporary custody order granting the parties exclusive, primary, and secondary custody over the child, without having jurisdiction to enter any permanent custody order.  On the other hand, the complaint alleges the court in this action improperly entered a custody order for the minor child, granting her secondary custody, and then entered a final judgment in the Child Custody Action that permanently terminated the court\u2019s jurisdiction in the child custody action.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently restrains the court jurisdiction over the parties, and orders the parties to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000, $50,000 in disgorgement, and $20,500 in prejudgment interest.  To settle the charges, Defendants also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000 and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years.  Additionally, Defendants agreed to be enjoined from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the sale or issuance of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of being barred from the securities industry.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 544, 546, 742 S.E.2d 799, 801 (2013).
