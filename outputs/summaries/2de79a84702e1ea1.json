  "summary": "On January 1, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against Dionicio Gutierrez-Salazar, a Mexican citizen who was charged, tried, and convicted by a jury of two murders for homicides committed in 2013 and 2015. As to the 2013 homicide, defendant was convicted of first degree murder on a felony-murder theory and the natural and probable consequences doctrine, as both were defined prior to the effective date of Senate Bill 1437. On September 30, 2018, while defendant's appeal was pending, the court consolidated two murder charges against him, one from 2013 and one from 2015, into one trial. The court found true a felony murder special circumstance under section 190, subdivision (a)(17) that was committed during the commission of a robbery, and that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty should apply to every case to which it constitutionally could apply. In addition, on September 8, 2015, the trial court granted a motion to consolidate the trial on the two murder counts, which resulted in a gross unfairness to defendant, denying him his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process, and requiring him to pay a civil penalty of $3,000.  The court granted the request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Gutierrez. The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Los Angeles, charges Gutierrez with violating Section 10-b of the Exchange Act. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa, Chief of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the California State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Department of Criminal Justice."
