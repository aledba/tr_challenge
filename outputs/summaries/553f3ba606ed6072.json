  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Julius Jamal Garnett, who was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on May 9, 2014, Pamela Carnahan was found dead in her apartment located in Alexandria, Louisiana. She died from stab wounds, and items found at the scene of the crime contained Defendant's DNA. According to the complaint, the evidence presented in the trial was circumstantial and insufficient to support the defendant's conviction. The complaint further alleges that when the jury deliberated on the matter, it was not unanimous that the jury had found Pamela guilty as required under the Jackson standard of review, and that the defendant did not have a twin brother. The SEC alleges that after the trial, the jury found him guilty as charged by an eleven to one vote. On July 22, 2016, the court granted the SEC's request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order. The court's order freezes the assets of the defendants and prohibits them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Garnett.  In its continuing investigation, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Daniel Wadley and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the New Orleans Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the New York State Attorney General's Office."
