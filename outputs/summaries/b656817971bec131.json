  "summary": "On April 13, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the defendants in a rent-stabilization case.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its order, the court also ordered the defendants to pay $184,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, Nunzio Ruggiero, a principal of 105 West 75th Street LLC, was the senior cost manager at a global consultancy company that offered a range of services to the construction and property industry, was a member of the Construction Financial Management Association, and a chartered surveyor.  As alleged in the complaint, in 2002, when apartment 5A became vacant, landlord decided to add a penthouse to the building and connect it to 5A and 5B, thus creating twin duplex apartments.  At the time, the complaint alleges that the penthouse was vacant, and landlord did not spend sufficient funds on individual apartment improvements to justify an increase in the rent.  Instead, according to the court's order, landlord spent approximately $200,000 for the renovation, which also entitled it to increase the rent by one-fortieth of the amount required to qualify for first rent, and $2,000 or more per month for the apartment next door, which did not exist at the time.   In addition, the order found that, based on the documentary evidence submitted by the landlord, the apartment was vacant prior to the renovations and that the majority of the work performed in the apartment consisted of repairs and maintenance that did not qualify as part of a rent regulation to which it was not entitled.  Finally, it ruled that the apartment had no historical value and that, as a result of the renovations, the rent was insufficiently significant for purposes of rent stabilization.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and ordering them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their legal fees and expenses.  On August 11, 2014, the Court granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order against further violations of the federal securities laws, ordered the destruction of documents, and ordered the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest."
