  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the city's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze to halt the construction of a $8.5 million, $10 million nursing home.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan on April 14, 2015, the District of Columbia (DOB) issued an order suspending construction of the proposed nursing home in Manhattan.  The complaint alleges that the DOB and BSA violated the \"open space\" provision of the Zoning Resolution, which requires that all residential units on a particular zoning lot be accessible and usable by all residents of the same building on the same lot.  As alleged in the complaint, the O.C.D.R. \u00a7'23\u201314 and 23\u2013142, and the building-by-building methodology in calculating the open space ratio for a multi-building zoning lot, did not meet the requirements of the 2009 resolution.  Instead, the complaint alleges, the 2011 amendments eliminated the requirement that a building be built on a specific zoning lot and replaced it with a \"zoning lot\" that included multiple buildings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the SEC, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for Manhattan today announced criminal charges against one of the defendants in connection with the alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the court to issue an order temporarily restraining the defendants from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the Exchange Act, ordering the building to comply with the required minimum open space requirements, and appointing a receiver to determine the amount of open space that can be allocated to a particular building on a certain zoning lot. The SEC's order also ordered the building owner to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and ordered the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver, which is subject to court approval.  Finally, the court granted the defendants' request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary asset freeze.  On May 2, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, and a penny stock bar against them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any penny stock in the securities industry.  This action is subject"
