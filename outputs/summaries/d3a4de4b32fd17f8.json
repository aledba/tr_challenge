  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Joseph Valerio, who was sentenced to 60 years' imprisonment on ten counts of conviction relating to the sexual exploitation of two minor children and the transportation, receipt, and possession of child pornography.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York on January 23, 2016, Valerios, a California resident, was asked to sit for an interview in the dining room of a home where he was being questioned by FBI agents during a search warrant. The complaint alleges that, after learning of the alleged nature of the conduct alleged by his co-conspirator, Kalichenko, he agreed to participate in the interview without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The SEC alleges that the FBI agent who conducted the search did not brandish or draw their weapons during the interview. Instead, he was cooperative with the agents and remained calm throughout the hearing.  The SEC further alleges that Valerius failed to show that the District Court improperly relied on the wrong Sentencing Guideline as a benchmark for determining whether a reasonable person would have considered himself free to leave the encounter and consider his freedom of action to be curtailed to a degree associated with a formal arrest.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for New York yesterday announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an emergency court order halting the litigation.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the New York District Court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze. The court will determine the amount of money that will be required to pay for the relief sought by the SEC in its parallel action.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 24, 2012).  The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Department of Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the U.N. Office of Inspector General."
