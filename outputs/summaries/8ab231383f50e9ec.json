  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment in favor of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services against Joseph Ayotte, Jr., a Michigan resident who engaged in domestic violence.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Arenac, Mich., on November 10, 2014, Ayotte was removed from his mother\u2019s home and placed in foster care.  The complaint alleges that Judge Richard Vollbach issued a temporary detention order on November 11, 2014 and ordered that defendant be placed with care and supervision after he was apprehended and placed into a juvenile detention facility on November 13, 2014.  In its order, the court found that the order was contrary to the welfare of the child and that it was necessary for the child to be removed from the home.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the final order requires that the child be placed in a foster home or child-care institution for the duration of his/her stay in the home, regardless of whether there is an emergency or non-emergency situation.   The SEC also requested that the court issue a temporary restraining order against Ayotte from violating these provisions, which is required by the federal securities laws.  On November 12, 2015, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced that it filed a parallel criminal case against the defendant, charging him with violating the anti-foster-welfare provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (4) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rules 5a-5, 5b2-1, and (2) thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1356.21 (2014).  In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced criminal charges against defendant, who has pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud in connection with the same criminal case.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General, and the case was supervised by Scott Frost, Chief of the Division of Child and Family Education. The litigation will be led by G.C. Timmis and Ms. Kim, and supervised by"
