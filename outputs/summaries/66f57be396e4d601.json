  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas yesterday entered a final judgment against the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that DFPS failed to adequately assess the risks associated with overburdened caseworkers.  According to the complaint, the agency's policies and practices are inconsistent with those of the federal government.  For example, the complaint alleges that, while DFPS is required to maintain a minimum of 10 caseworker staff, it does not have the capacity to adequately evaluate the safety and well-being of children in the agency\u2019s care.  In addition, as alleged in the SEC complaint, DFPS does not require staff to be trained to spot signs of child abuse or neglect, such as signs of physical or mental harm, when evaluating whether a child is at risk of harm.  As a result, the SEC alleges that the agency is failing to adequately protect children in its care from abuse and neglect, and that it has not adequately trained its staff to detect signs of such misconduct.  Specifically, according to the SEC, many of the children in DFPS care are unsophisticated and vulnerable, and many are not even aware that they are being placed in foster homes.  Among other things, the court found that the state violated the federal securities laws by failing to properly train and supervise its staff.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.   The court's order, which was entered yesterday, permanently enjoins DFPS from violating these provisions, and orders the agency to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
