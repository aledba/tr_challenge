  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed on May 24, 2010, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from 2011 through 2016, the defendants received more than $14 million in contracts, purchase orders, and funding modifications from the U.N. Department of the Navy and the Navy's Office of Inspector General.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in 2011 and 2013, Mr. Traugh and Mr. Bosworth were employed by the Navy as program managers and assistant program managers, respectively, when they were debarred from participating in any government contracting work.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, the Defendants failed to establish de facto debarment with respect to certain of the contracts, including those awarded to MDD in fiscal year 2012.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission Report, Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them.  Additionally, the court has granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment, which is subject to court approval, to be entered by the court upon motion by the parties.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, 13, 16, 17, 18, and 17, and the Complaint Bulletin No. 24, 13 and 16, 13 & 17, 13&20, 13/11/11, 12&13, 13-14, 16&17, and 13/20/11.  On October 5, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, ordering the defendants to return their allegedly fraudulent claims to the court, and ordering the Commission to issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of all of MDD's contracts.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Wyshans."
