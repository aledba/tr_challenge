  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered final judgments in favor of defendants Ramesh Patel and his wife Jyoti Patel in connection with the purchase of two properties in Middleburg Heights, Ohio.  According to the court's order, filed on May 29, 2016, in the U.K. district court for the Southern District of New York, Patel, his wife, Suryakant Patel, and brother Pravin Patel violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that the defendants failed to comply with certain of the court orders recognizing and enforcing money judgments issued to them in the United Kingdom and Kenya.  In addition, the court found that defendants violated Section 5 of the Family Settlement Agreement and Rule 5b2-1 thereunder, and that defendants were entitled to judgment on all of the claims for relief based on the facts presented in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the parties.  On June 5, 2018, a federal district court in Ohio issued final judgments against Patel and Patel, ordering them to disgorge $1,760,000 in ill-gotten gains plus interest and a civil penalty of $521,016, and ordering the defendants to pay a $50,000 civil penalty and a $1 million civil penalty in the amount of $1.4 million.  Patel and Suryaka Patel also agreed to settle the case against them by agreeing to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, including Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and Rule 13d-3 thereunder; and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-11, July 17, 2018."
