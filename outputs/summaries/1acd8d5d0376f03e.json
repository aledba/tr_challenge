  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a Kansas man who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Kansas, alleges that, from at least August 2014 through August 2015, Father was offered and recommended termination of parental rights pursuant to Section 211.037 of the federal securities laws. The court found that, contrary to these findings, Father did not participate in any of the services that were offered or recommended in order to develop the relationship between Father and Child. In addition, the court ordered that Father be provided supervised and \"sandwiched\" visits with Child, and that he provide 24-hour advanced notice if he was cancelling a visit.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Father.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on January 25, 2017, the SEC obtained a judgment against Father that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 211, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty in the amount of $5,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Father has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and from participating in any offering of any form of adult-child custody in the future. The judgment also orders that he be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years.  On May 26, 2016, a permanency review hearing was held and Father was appointed counsel.  As set forth in the Complaint:  The Court found that Father violated Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") by failing to participate in the provision of the Adoption and Education Task Force (Adviser Act).  The court also found that he violated Section 211 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, that he failed to comply with the court's order to terminate Father\u2019s parental rights, and failed to provide reasonable and sufficient evidence to support his termination.   The complaint also alleges that the court improperly appointed a caseworker to assist Father with the placement of a child under his control, and instructed her to send a copy of the letter to the child's mother to be sent to the agency.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that Father failed to cooperate with the agency in its investigation of the alleged violations of Section 206"
