  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the city's request for a summary judicial inquiry into alleged violations of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that the City Attorney's Office (\"Securities and Exchange Commission\") and the New York City Department of Education (DOE) have failed to adequately investigate allegations of violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the DOE has failed to comply with its obligations under Section 1109 of the Exchange Act.  According to the complaint, the DOE is not a proper party to this matter because it has not implemented any IEP-mandated services, and the DOE contract with Maximus Inc. (\u201cMaximus\u201d) was not filed with the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the SEC has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of Sections 1109, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Education and the Department of Justice today announced that it has issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the implementation of the proposed inquiry.  On September 20, 2016, the court issued a temporary restraining order against the defendants and ordered the SEC to conduct a preliminary examination of the complaint.  A hearing for the SEC on September 21, 2016 is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 21, 2020)."
