Malone, Jr., of Omaha, Nebraska, in a motor vehicle homicide and manslaughter case.  The court found that Malone violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933.
