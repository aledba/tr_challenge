  "summary": "On January 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans entered a final judgment against Kim W. Kunow, Jr., a Louisiana resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on April 2, 2016, Kunow was pulled over by Deputy Thomas J. Schlesinger of the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Office for swerving outside the lane of travel multiple times. The complaint alleges that Kunow submitted to a chemical test that showed a blood alcohol level of 0.167 percent, exceeding the legal limit, and that he was unable to perform his duties without a valid driver's license. According to the complaint, the suspension and disqualification of Kunow's license were improper because he had already faced a disqualification for driving while intoxicated for over a year by his employer, who imposed the disqualification.  Kunow also allegedly claimed that OMV submitted insufficient proof at the administrative hearing to justify the suspension.  In a parallel action, the SEC today announced that it has obtained a temporary restraining order against Kunow and issued him a temporary permit to operate a commercial motor vehicle for one year, which Kunow agreed to, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Kunow from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.00, a $500,000 civil penalty, and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.  On February 13, 2019, the court granted Kunow the opportunity to apply for a preliminary injunction and for a de novo review of the Alabama Department of Public Safety and Corrections' (DPS&CDL) findings, which he agreed to. The court also ordered Kunow to comply with the requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act, including that he submit to an approved chemical test for intoxication, which results show a blood-alcohol level below the permissible limit. The SEC previously issued an order suspending Kunow for 90 days pursuant to La. R. S. 14:98.1, which it found to be insufficient to satisfy the requirements contained in the ALJ's finding, and OMV to impose a permanent suspension of his driving privileges. In a separate administrative proceeding on April 27, 2017, a federal district court in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, issued a temporary suspension and disqualified him from operating a commercial vehicle. On June 3, 2016 the district court issued an administrative order ordering Kunow not to cooperate with the investigation that"
