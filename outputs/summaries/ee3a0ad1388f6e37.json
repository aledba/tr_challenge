  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against Dejaun Evans, a former Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department officer who was convicted of two felony counts of robbery, conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon, and possession of a firearm by a felon. On appeal, Defendant alleges that the trial court erred by: (1) failing to extend the session of court in which his trial began, resulting in entry of judgment out of session and without jurisdiction; and (2) responding to a question from the jury with a written request for clarification read to the jury by the bailiff, in violation of criminal procedure statutes. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Defendant consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15A-1234 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $1,738.99 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for North Carolina and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
