  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Shannon and Triad Holdings III, L.L.C., ordering Shannon to pay $572,725.00 in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 2012, Shannon, Triad, and the Partnership violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that in binding the Partnership to pay an additional $11.79/sq. ft., Shannon violated the duty of care provision of the federal securities laws by failing to comply with certain of those provisions. In addition, the complaint alleges that after the Partnership agreed to a five-year lease renewal in 2012 that it would not pay any additional rent to the Partnership, it agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Shannon arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint against Triad. The SEC is continuing its investigation into the matter. The case is being handled by John Rymas of the SEC's New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica and Ms. Scoggins, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Office of Investor Education and Advocacy."
