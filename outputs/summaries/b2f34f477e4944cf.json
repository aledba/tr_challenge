  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona today entered a final judgment against Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company, Inc., a California-based insurance company, and its controlling shareholder, Bell Atl. Corp.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, alleges that, from at least 2009 through at least 2018, Hartford violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Hartford, through its control person, Dawn Gunter, repeatedly and implicitly accused Deena Stoker of lying about her disability and committing insurance fraud.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in reaching its decision to terminate her benefits based on Hartford's refusal to timely pay her benefits, Stoker allegedly attempted to commit suicide by attempting to take her own life.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, from 2009 through 2018, Plaintiff suffered multiple psychiatric and physical symptoms, including severe depression and co-morbid panic disorder.  During this period, Hartford paid Plaintiff LTD benefits for twenty-four months based on a finding that she was unable to perform the duties of her \"Own Job,\" for several years thereafter based on her denial of benefits, until her February 2018 hospitalization.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Complaint and in the Commission's Order, Hartford has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and orders the company to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 10-cv-01283-CJC, May 24, 2018.  On June 13, 2018, a federal district court in Arizona granted a motion to dismiss Hartford's request for a temporary restraining order against the company from further violations of the federal anti-fraud provisions, ordered a hearing on the matter, and ordered a preliminary injunction against further violations.  A hearing is scheduled for May 26, 2019, for which the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Arizona Department of Insurance, the Arizona Office of Insurance Regulation, and the Arizona Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
