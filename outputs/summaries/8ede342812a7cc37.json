  "summary": "On August 22, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and its pastor for allegedly breaching his employment contract.  According to the SEC's complaint, Rev. William David Lee was terminated from his position as pastor of the Sixth Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church of Pittsburg in December 2012.  The complaint alleges that Lee failed to respond at all to the Church\u2019s defenses and failed to comply with its requests for a judgment ordering him to be removed from the position.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Lee.  Lee has agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  On August 22nd, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in New York, alleging that Lee violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The complaint seeks summary judgment against Lee, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael Petruska and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and John R. Rymas of the New York Regional Office, with assistance from Joseph G. Sansone, Regional Director of the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy."
