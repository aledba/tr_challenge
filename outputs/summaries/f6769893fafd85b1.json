  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Illinois-based Liberty PAC, a political action committee, and two other individuals for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that certain campaign contribution limits set by the Illinois Disclosure and Regulation of Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), 10 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/9-8.5(b)\u2013(c), violate the First Amendment.  According to the complaint, the Act requires political parties to provide unlimited support to their candidates during a general election.  For example, the complaint alleges that political parties can make unlimited contributions to candidates in a specific election cycle but limit individual contributions to $5,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Liberty PAC and its co-defendant, Kyle McCarter, have agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their respective contributions.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against Liberty PAC.  On May 24, 2016, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of the books and records of the Illinois Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Illinois Secretary of State, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Illinois Office of Inspector General in this matter."
