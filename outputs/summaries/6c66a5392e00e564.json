  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered final judgments against GlaxoSmithKline, Inc. (GSK) and GSK Holding Corp. (GSK) on the basis of newly acquired information about the risk of suicide in adults.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that GSK's negligent omissions in the drug label for Paxil caused her husband, Stewart Dolin, to commit suicide in 2010.  According to the complaint, GSK failed to inform the FDA that it was required to add a warning about the potential association between paroxetine and suicide in older adults and failed to do so when the FDA rejected its earlier recommendation.  GSK also failed to disclose that it had previously acquired information that supported its decision not to add the warning.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against GSK.  On May 1, 2007, the court granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction, ordered GSK to comply with the court's order, and ordered the company to submit a preemption defense.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Gsk agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $75,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The court also granted the company a temporary restraining order, which prohibits it from issuing or selling any security-based security-related security products, and from imposing any price-based injunctive relief. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 596 F.3d at 571, 129 S.Ct. (2010).  The complaint also names GSK as a defendant in a related action brought by the SEC in connection with a related criminal case.  This case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, Patrick J. McCluskey, and Amy S. Cotter of the Chicago Regional Office, with assistance from Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit."
