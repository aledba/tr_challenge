  "summary": "On January 17, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment in favor of the Amherst-Pelham Regional School Committee in a civil injunctive action action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Boston, alleges that, in September 2016, the District Court entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In its order, the court also entered a preliminary injunction against the Defendants from violating these provisions.  According to the SEC's order, filed under seal on January 18, 2019 and unsealed on January 19, 2020, the defendants agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The court also granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment against the relief sought by the SEC.  On January 24, 2019 the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The SEC also issued an order requiring defendants to show cause and effect in a court proceeding concerning the remediation of alleged violations of Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The order also prohibits defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service, and prohibits them from engaging in any conduct that constitutes a violation of the First and Second Amendments to the Securities Act of 1933. The Court's order also requires defendants to provide a copy of the Complaint to the court for review.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 18, 2020).  In a related matter, the Court issued an Order suspending Defendants from appearing before the SEC as a \"partner\" in any proceeding related to the subject matter of the litigation. The Order also ordered the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the safety and effectiveness of its remediation efforts.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for February 21, 2019.
