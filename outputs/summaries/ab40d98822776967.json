  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a former carpenter and carpenter who was found disabled on his fiftieth birthday.  According to the SEC's complaint, Michael J. Biestek, who was employed as a carpenter in various construction-related roles, became disabled on October 28, 2009, for purposes of receiving Disability Insurance Benefits and Supplemental Security Income under the Social Security Act. The complaint alleges that, at the time of his discovery, the agency had not obtained necessary medical-expert testimony to support its finding that he was not disabled, and that he had not been able to bend at the waist for over two years.  The complaint further alleges that the agency failed to properly weigh the evidence presented to the agency by the vocational expert, Dr. Frank L. Barnes, who also testified in the SEC\u2019s complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins the agency from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the agency to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New Jersey today filed criminal charges in the case.  On May 4, 2013, a federal district court in New York entered a temporary restraining order, ordering the SEC to comply with the court order, imposing a $25,000 civil penalty, and appointing a receiver of the SEC-issued records. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael B. Kornecky and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Knecht and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 2, 2017).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney\u2019S Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
