  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against the estate of Loyd and Martha Bradshaw, granting them a divorce on the ground of adultery.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi on March 24, 2017, the chancellor improperly classified Loyd's and Martha's properties as separate property.  The complaint alleges that the chancellor misapplied several Albright factors, including: (1) the employment of the parents, (2) the nature of the relationship, and (3) the extent to which Loyd had engaged in an extramarital affair during the marriage. (4) The complaint also alleges that Loyd gave her a disproportionate amount of debt. (5) As alleged in the complaint, when questioned about this matter, Loyd replied that he did not have the money to pay his attorney's fees. (6) Loyd also allegedly gave her the silent treatment for two to three weeks at a time throughout the entire marriage.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that after the divorce Loyd claimed that his mother had left him for a third party for approximately one year, and that his father had left her for the third party.  As alleged, when confronted by Loyd about this conduct, he replied, \"I'm not sure what exactly the doctor advised you to do.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Loyd.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgments also order Loyd to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, and Martha to pay $80,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Office of Advocacy and Public Education. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mississippi Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
