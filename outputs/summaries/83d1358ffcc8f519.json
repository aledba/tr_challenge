  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Montana today entered a temporary restraining order against a Montana man and his two adult children in an emergency custody proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Montana, alleges that Raymond Kree Kirkman violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the court erroneously modified the parties\u2019 prior Florida parenting plan in violation of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA).  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in 2015, Father and his adult daughter, M.K. and K.K., were the subject of an emergency order issued by a court in Florida that temporarily placed the children in the custody of another state.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Middle District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Father.  On August 21, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in the District Court in Montana issued an order suspending Father from contact with the children and ordering him to surrender his passport.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Father consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Father also agreed to be enjoined from associating with any person with a criminal conviction for any conduct that constitutes a form of \"child custody.\"  The court also ordered that the court consider whether to issue an emergency court order requiring the children to be placed in a home state for the duration of a child custody proceeding, and that it would determine whether to impose a permanent injunction against Father and/or any other person in the home state at a later time.   The settlement is subject to court approval, and the court will determine the appropriate amount of relief to be provided by the court upon motion of the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in the United Kingdom and the United State Attorney General's Office today in the Eastern District of New York seeking an emergency restraining order, an injunction, and a court order against Father from contacting the children.  This matter was investigated by the SEC's Office of Child Advocacy, which issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage parents to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC"
