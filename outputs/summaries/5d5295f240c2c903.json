  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a related action.  The court entered a temporary restraining order against the Defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles on April 17, 2013, the defendants agreed to settle the case by agreeing to pay $330,696.60 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their fees.  In its order, the court also ordered the defendants to pay a $50,000 civil penalty.  As alleged in the complaint, defendants failed to disclose to the court that they were not entitled to a permanent, unconditional public easement, and that they had no right to the easement at all.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay civil penalties of $150,000, and orders the destruction of any evidence that may have been obtained in connection with the alleged violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rules 5a-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and imposes a $75,000 penalty against each of the defendants.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the United States District Court in Santa Monica granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 5(b).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Brian A. Blasius and Glenn S. Gordon of the Los Angeles Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Ms. Gordon and Mr. Gordon. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Nevada Secretary of State's Office and the California Department of Banking and Securities and Investments."
