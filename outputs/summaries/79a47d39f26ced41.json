  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against BASF, W-LLC, and W-Limited for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Colorado on February 1, 2018, BASF's complaint alleges that W-LCC, a company based in Florham Park, New Jersey, and its principal place of business in Broomfield, Colorado, sought and received registration and approval for products allegedly obtained in violation of the \"392\" and \"451\" patents.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants sought to register the products with the federal government, but W-lCC did not participate in the registration or distribution of the products.  BASF also alleges that, contrary to its representations to the federal authorities, the defendants did not engage in any illegal activity at the forum.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas in the Denver Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Department of Agriculture, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Secretary of State's Office, the Denver Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice's Retail Strategy Task Force,\u00c2\u00a0Investors in Agrochemicals, Inc.
