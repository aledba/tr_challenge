  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Iraqi government and ordered it to repatriate over 1,400 Iraqi nationals.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, on June 24, 2017, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California announced that it had obtained an emergency court order halting the repatriation of more than 100 Iraqi nationals who had been ordered removed from the United States.  The complaint alleges that the Iraqi authorities failed to comply with the court's order, and that the court issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the return of the remaining Iraqi nationals to Baghdad.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the court granted the request for a preliminary injunction and ordered Baghdad to issue an order suspending the repatriations.  In a parallel action, on September 21, 2018, the United Kingdom's Attorney General's Office filed an emergency action in which it issued an order temporarily suspending all immigration proceedings in the country and ordering Baghdad to provide an accounting of the number of Iraqis who were repatriated.  On October 2, 2018 the U-S Attorney's office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania announced criminal charges against the Iraqis.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the Iraqis consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Separately, on October 9, 2018 a federal district court in Manhattan issued an emergency order suspending all repatriations of Iraqi nationals, including those from the Middle East, who were ordered to return to their countries of origin, including Iraq.   The court also ordered the Iraqi Ministry of Justice to issue a cease-and-desist order, which was followed by a court order requiring Baghdad to respond to any requests for repatriation in a timely manner.  Additionally, the Court issued an Order suspending the issuance of any emergency relief orders in the case, including an order requiring the Iraqi Attorney General to provide a copy of the court order.  Finally, on November 5, 2018 in a parallel administrative proceeding, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia entered an order imposing an order that temporarily suspended all repatriation orders for the Iraqis, ordering the Iraqis to return, and imposing a $1.5 million civil penalty against each of them. \u00c2\u00a0The court also granted the Iraqis' request for an expedited hearing to determine whether repatriation should be halted.
