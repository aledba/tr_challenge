  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against defendant Guillermo Robert Gentile for second-degree murder in connection with the 2014 beating death of a San Diego County woman.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indio, California, Gentile was convicted of first degree murder on the basis of evidence that he aided and abetted Saundra Roberts' murder.  The complaint alleges that, prior to June 21, 2014, the defendant and Saavedra lived in the back of the La Casita restaurant, acting as property caretakers and handymen.  As alleged in the complaint, before the trial began, the jury found that defendant had committed first-degree premeditated murder by means of a club, wooden chair, and a beer bottle, and that the defendant had been in a fight with someone and had hit the victim with a club or a sledgehammer.  In a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Gentile, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the San Diego Police Department, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the California Department of Banking and Securities and Investments."
