  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against Boston-based attorney J. Whitfield Larrabee, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Massachusetts, alleges that, since 1999, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) has provided the Commission with records and case information in response to public records requests without regard to whether the investigation of those complaints was open or closed.  According to the complaint, the MCAD provided the Globe with copies of complaints and spreadsheets it had generated containing data taken from both open and closed investigations, including the names and addresses of both complainants and respondents, taken from either open or completed investigations.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Commission violated the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rules 5b2-3 and 17a-1 thereunder, and the reporting provision of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $10,000, $5,000 and $1,500, respectively. The Commission's settlement is subject to court approval.   The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Boston Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and other relevant authorities."
