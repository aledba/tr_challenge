  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against Robert Grott, a former marine who was discharged in December 2012.  The court found that Grott violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, filed on April 12, 2017, Grott was charged with first-attempted self-defense based on a first aggressor instruction given at his trial for a shooting incident in which Grott claimed that he acted in self-defence.  As alleged in the SEC's complaint, however, the defendant was not a reasonable person to believe that he had engaged in a course of aggressive conduct when he had a reasonable fear of imminent harm from the aggressor.  Grott also was charged for failing to object to the first aggressors instruction, which was not supported by the evidence presented at trial.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Grott.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. O'Hara and Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, with assistance from John Rymas of the Division of Justice's Analysis and Detection Center. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. O\u2019Hara, Ms. Werner, and Mr. Werner."
