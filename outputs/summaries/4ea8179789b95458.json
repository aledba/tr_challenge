  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against Samuel L. Harris, Jr., a Kansas City, Kansas man who was convicted of kidnapping, robbery, criminal restraint, and criminal threat in 2013.  The court found that Harris violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  According to the court's order, Harris, who was a resident of Lyon County, Kansas at the time of the alleged kidnapping, used the pre-Hall common-sense rule to determine whether a defendant was entitled to a fair trial based on the facts of the case.  As alleged in the complaint, Harris took control of Lujan while she was trying to sleep and held her in her apartment for nearly two hours while she demanded money.  After Lujan refused to give him the money, Harris allegedly demanded that he leave the apartment.  He then demanded that Lujan give him $700, which he did not have, and demanded that she give him.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Harris.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Harris consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to return the stolen property, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar.  On May 3, 2020, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Harris, ordering him to surrender his passport, and requiring him to show cause and effect of a court order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's receiver.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Patrick D. McAnany and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kansas Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
