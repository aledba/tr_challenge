  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in a civil injunctive action brought by Planned Parenthood of Greater Washington and North Idaho. The court found that the 2018 Tier 1 FOA violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the court also entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $101,000.  The court also issued an order freezing the defendants' assets and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Planned Parenthood.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Columbia, the defendants failed to show cause and effect, and the court found the defendants liable for violations of the federal securities laws. The SEC's action, which was unsealed today, is the latest in a series of administrative actions by the federal government to address the issues raised in the complaint.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that Planned Parenthood violated the anti-fraud provision of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 15b-20, 15a-1, and 16a-11 thereunder, and that the complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against the defendants. The complaint also alleges that the defendants violated Section 17(e) of\u00c2\u00a0The Securities Act, Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 13(b).  The complaint seeks a preliminary injunction, an order to freeze the defendants\u2019 assets, and an order appointing a receiver for the victims of the alleged fraud.  On May 24, 2019, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Washington entered a judgment ordering a temporary injunction against the Defendants from violating the federal anti-defraud provisions, ordering the Defendants to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting, however, that the Defendants violated the federal pre-judgment provisions of the Commission Act, the Commission has issued a Notice of Intent to Release the Complaint"
