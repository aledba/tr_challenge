  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment in favor of the trustees of a multiemployer benefit plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.  The court granted the trustees' request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other emergency relief.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut on August 23, 2017, MailFinance Inc. and Neopost USA Inc. (collectively, \"the Fund\") agreed to settle a civil action brought by the Service Employees International Union Healthcare IL Home Care and Child Care Fund (SEIU Funds) by agreeing to a forum-selection clause that would govern the Fund's use of the funds' mail and postage equipment. The complaint alleges that the forum selection clause is presumptively valid and enforceable because it makes up the complete agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements. The court also found that the Fund violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Court granted the defendants' motion to transfer the case to the district court for the Eastern District of Illinois, where it will be handled by the Division of Justice. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the Court issued an order freezing the assets of the Fund and ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $2,815.01. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Connecticut Office of Inspector General, and the Connecticut Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
