  "summary": "On April 5, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans entered a final judgment against Carrollton Pest Control and Termite Company, Inc., a Louisiana-based company owned by Francis Fasone.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Appellant worked for the company for twenty-three years prior to his resignation on May 20, 2016. According to the complaint, he was told he would earn vacation time in one year, and to use it in the following year. The complaint further alleges that he received letters from Mr. Fasone stating that he had used only three of his fifteen accrued vacation days from 2015, in addition to the 6.25 days accrued in 2016, for a total of 18.25 vacation days. The SEC alleges that, contrary to these representations, the company did not pay him the full amount of vacation time he was entitled to, and that he did not earn the full fifteen days of vacation that he claimed to earn in the same calendar year.  Appelant also alleged that he was not entitled to any vacation days in any calendar year based on the length of time he had been with the company.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Appellee consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $2,974.02 plus interest, costs, and attorney's fees. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against Appelance.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Appellance, charging him with violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws, and with aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(b)(5) and 13(a)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1. The court also issued an order suspending Appellante from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to provide an accounting of the amount of unpaid vacation days that he has accrued in the calendar year that he would like to use in the second year of his or her employment.  An SEC investigation was conducted by David M. Tonry and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the New Orleans Regional Office. The litigation will be led by David W. Messina. The case is being supervised by C.J."
