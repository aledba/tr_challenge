  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Ralph Colombo for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in 2005, Colombo, representing himself, was sued by his homeowners association, Nellie Gail Ranch Owners Association, in Orange County Superior Court, for unpaid attorney fees. The complaint alleges that Colombo filed a second request for a prefiling order in July 2016, which was denied by the court. Colombo then sought and received a court-ordered injunction preventing him from filing a new complaint in a subsequent proceeding. The court granted Colombo a temporary restraining order and ordered him to sign a substitution of attorney form, which he did not comply with. The SEC alleges that the second request was filed on the same day that the court denied Colombo\u2019s second request. The third request, filed on April 24, 2016, was denied on the basis of the preclusion provision of the federal securities laws, and Colombo was barred from appearing before the court as a litigant in a future proceeding. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of $50,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $26,250. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Scott A. Kasper. The litigation will be led by Messrs. Berry and Paul G. Ricchiute. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Orange County Office of Inspector General in this matter."
