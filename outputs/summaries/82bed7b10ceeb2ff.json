  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered final judgments against Scotty Blevins and his fianc\u00e9e, Anna Eubanks, in a civil injunctive action brought by the SEC.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, from January 10, 2017 to January 11, 2017, Scotty blevins engaged in a three-minute \"tug of war\" between two potential jurors.  According to the complaint, the defendants took two guns, a.22 rifle, and a loaded AK-47 style rifle.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, these were pretextual and discriminatory strikes that were not consistent with the facts and circumstances surrounding the case.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant repeatedly hit victims with his fists and the rifle, causing the back of Victim's head to hit the concrete driveway with each strike.   The complaint further alleges that the defendants did not engage in a reasonable search for corroborating evidence, and that, in fact, they left the scene by walking up the street with the rifles.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Mississippi, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Department of Justice in this matter."
