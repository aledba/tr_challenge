  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin today entered a final judgment in favor of Wren's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against Wren.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison, Wisconsin, alleges that Wren, with counsel, failed to timely file a notice of intent to seek postconviction relief as promised, causing him to lose his direct appeal rights.  According to the complaint, Wren was aware no appeal had been filed by 2010 or 2011 when he learned of the state's failure to file an appeal and had long since heard nothing from his attorney.  Wren also allegedly failed to inform his family members that he was going to file a petition in the style of a \"Notice of Intent to Seek Postconviction Relief\" on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.  In addition, the complaint alleges Wren failed to disclose to his family that his counsel had not responded to his requests for a hearing on the merits of his habeas petition.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court of appeals agreed with Wren that he had a duty and authority to determine whether to apply laches to his behalf. The court also agreed that Weren had an independent obligation to raise this matter with the court.  As a result of the court's finding, the SEC is prohibited from imposing laches on defendants who fail to comply with the requirements of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court has the right to determine when to issue an order imposing a laches order.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 539 (2014).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action on Wren and sought a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  A hearing is scheduled for November 12, 2019, for which the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wisconsin Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
