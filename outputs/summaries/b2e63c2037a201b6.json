  "summary": "On November 27, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a former supervisor of the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (ABC Board) for filing a civil injunctive action in June 2011.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that the district court improperly allowed Perry to present evidence related to her dismissed claims in the context of retaliation for filing her lawsuit.  According to the complaint, Perry filed her retaliation claim in November 2011, alleging that she was unfairly scrutinized and disciplined by the ABC Board in connection with her June 2011 lawsuit. The complaint further alleges that, as a result of this conduct, Perry received two disciplinary actions, a written reprimand for tardiness and insubordination, and a suspension for violating leave policies and procedures.  In a parallel action, the federal district court agreed that Perry was entitled to a new trial under the cumulative error doctrine, which prohibits defendants from prejudgmenting a jury's decision based on a finding of reasonable cause.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Perry consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000.00. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1349 (11th Cir. 1984).  The complaint charges Perry with violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 1349 and Rule 15a-1 thereunder and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On December 11, 2018, the court granted the SEC\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Perry and ordered the SEC to conduct an independent investigation into the matter.  A hearing on December 13, 2018 is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Department of Insurance, and the Alabama Office of Inspector General."
