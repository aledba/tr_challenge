  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a Florida man who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Plant City, Florida, alleges that, in January 2017, Isaac Thomas, a convicted felon with a prior felony conviction for attempted carjacking, violated the federal securities laws by failing to show that he knew that he was a felon prohibited from possessing a firearm.  According to the complaint, Thomas consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 922(q)(2)(A) and 924(a)(4) and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years.  Thomas also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any firearm, other than for his own personal use.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Order\u00c2\u00a0to\u00c2\u00a0find\u00c2\u00a0proof\u00c2\u00a0that Thomas knew that his firearm had moved in or affected interstate commerce when he possessed it.\u00c2\u00a0The order\u00c2\u00a0also requires the government to prove that the defendant knew that, at the time of the instant unlawful possession of a firearm, he had not been convicted of a felony and had not had his rights restored.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Thomas has agreed to a permanent injunction, to a conduct-based injunction, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 20, 2017).  The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Assistant Director of the Miami Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered an order permanently enjoining Thomas from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, ordering him to surrender his firearm and pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his criminal conviction.  On May 9, 2019, the court granted the request for a temporary restraining order against Thomas, ordered him to return his allegedly illegal possession of the firearm, and issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.
