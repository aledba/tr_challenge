  "summary": "On March 18, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment finding that Southern Trust Metals, Inc. and Robert Escobio violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  The court also issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to pay $1.5 million in restitution to the investors who fell victim to his commodity-fraud scheme.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, the court found that the defendants were not registered as a futures commission and that the court lacked the authority to impose a civil contempt penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against EscOBio.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,543,892 plus interest of $10,000 per month, and a civil penalty of $559,725.  On March 19, the District Court entered a judgment granting the defendants contempt for failing to pay the restitution in full.  It also issued an order requiring the defendants disgorging their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, imposing civil penalties, and imposing a $250,000 civil penalty. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica and Mr. Blau. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Compliance and Assurance Fraud Section of the Division's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, and the case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit. The examination was conducted by Jennifer C. Barry and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office under the supervision of John R. Kasper. The exam was conducted with the assistance of trial counsel Robert E. Basinger of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The trial counsels for the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) will lead the litigation. The court will determine the amount of restitution owed to the victims of the alleged fraud."
