  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against AT&T Mobility LLC and its putative class representatives, agreeing to pay $1.2 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that, in violation of the federal securities laws, AT&t violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the Federal Arbitration Act of 1940, which requires private parties to pay for disputed medical treatments, was not a sufficient basis for state action under the federal law. The court also held that the federal government is the relevant state actor for any action.  In its judgment, the court held that, as alleged in the complaint, there is no such thing as a \"state actor\" when a private party is acting as a state actor.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $1,2 million. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2019, the Court issued a temporary restraining order, temporarily enjoining the defendants from violating these provisions, ordering an injunction, and imposing a $11 million civil penalty.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, the injunction order was issued on May 9, 2019. The SEC has not yet issued an order requiring the defendants to comply with the court order, and the court has not issued any order requiring them to show that they are complying with the federal court order. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Colorado today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged violations of the anti-fraud provisions. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Marcus Roberts, Kenneth Chewey, and James Krenn. The Court appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Department of Insurance, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Denver Office of Inspector General, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the California Department of Banking and Securities and the Colorado Office of the Secretary of State's Office."
