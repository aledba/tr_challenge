  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against defendant Branden Lee Hall, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that Hall violated Section 1021.5 of the Exchange Act by failing to comply with a court order requiring him to submit to a chemical test for blood alcohol.  According to the complaint, Hall then filed a writ of mandate in the superior court, which required Hall to show, among other things, that he \"prevailed\" in the litigation because he was the \"prevailing party.\"  The complaint further alleges that after Hall learned about the charges against Benavidez, Hall's attorney charged him with violating his due process right to a fair hearing.  Hall agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, and agreed to pay $1,662 in attorney fees.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hall arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On July 22, 2015, the court granted Hall a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return his driver's license to the DMV.  After Hall filed his amended writ of mandamus on July 24, 2015 and a hearing date of July 31, 2016, Hall was arrested by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for driving under the influence.  He was later convicted and sentenced to prison terms of 10 years and ordered to pay a $19,434 civil penalty.  As a result of the court's order, Hall has been barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any automobile, and from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney.   The court also ordered Hall to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $12,758.50, which Hall has not agreed to.  Without admitting or denied the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, Hall consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay civil penalties in the amount of $145,044, which is equal to the amount he has already paid in his civil action against the Commission, and to pay an officer-and-director bar in the case of Hall. \u00c2\u00a0Hall also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer and director of a public company, and that he will pay a civil penalty of $192,"
