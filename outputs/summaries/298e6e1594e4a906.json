  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with committing an attempted robbery in Indiana.  According to the court's order, D.D.B., who was just six years old at the time, committed the attempted robbery on July 28, 2017, and was immediately apprehended by the Indiana State Police.  The court also found that D.B. had a prior felony conviction for attempted robbery, a Class B felony, and that he had previously been found guilty of a similar felony in Illinois.  As alleged in the court order, however, the defendant had no prior criminal convictions for the same felony.  In addition, the court found that the defendant did not have a prior criminal conviction for a felony that required proof of intent to commit, and therefore did not need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt to qualify him for a mandatory transfer for criminal prosecution.  Without admitting or denying the court\u2019s findings, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On August 1, 2018, the Court issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and imposing a conduct-based injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and the books and records provision of Section 15(a) and 15(b)(2)(B)(i).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged attempted robbery.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Indianapolis, charges the defendant with violating the anti-jail laws and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, a penny stock bar, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of imprisonment.  To learn more about pre-judgment interest in this matter, see Litigation Release No. 17 (2014).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Indiana Attorney General's Office, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the U."
