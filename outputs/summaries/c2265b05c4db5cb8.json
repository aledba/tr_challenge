According to the SEC's order, on February 13, 2008, Granite Building 2, LLC and Kulka Contracting, LLC were hired to hang wallpaper in a newly constructed office building that was nearly complete.

On March 24, 2013, the United States District Court in Manhattan entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders the parties to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The court also granted the defendants' motion for leave to amend their answer to include a cross claim against it for contractual indemnification and to recover damages for breach of contract for failure to procure insurance. The Court granted the parties' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer and director bar against them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, sale, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply for a penny stock bar at any time.
