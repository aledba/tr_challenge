  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against a Kentucky-based insurance company for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky, alleges that Kentucky law prohibits the issuance of arbitration judgments without the prior written consent of the court.  According to the complaint, Kentucky law requires the court to determine whether a company is entitled to arbitration by virtue of its status as a \"business of insurance.\"  For example, the complaint alleges that in 2011 and 2012, Kentucky issued its initial health plan policy, but by late 2015, the company was insolvent and placed into rehabilitation in Franklin County, Kentucky.  In 2013, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Milliman, Inc., a self-insured company, and ordered the company to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty.  On May 13, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in Franklin Circuit Court, alleging that Milliman violated the federal arbitration provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Milliman consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,157, which is equal to the amount of the civil penalty that the court will impose.   The court's order also prohibits Milliman from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any insurance policy, and prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by David H. Javitch and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Messrs. J.D. and Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office."
