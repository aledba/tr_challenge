  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against Angela L. Jones, a Kansas City, Kan., resident charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Jones, ordering her to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to comply with a court order requiring her to serve a 24-month postrelease supervision term.  According to the court's order, on May 12, 2014, the district court granted a dispositional departure from the bench and placed Jones on probation for 36 months. The court then ordered Jones to serve her original sentence of 51 months, to run consecutively, for a total sentence of 85 months' imprisonment.  On August 30, 2016, the court issued a judgment that permanently enjoins Jones from violating the prerelease supervision provisions of the federal securities laws and orders her to repay the amount of her probation with interest in a later date.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jones. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges Jones with violating Section 15(b)(2)(A) and (3) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"). The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Jones has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the securities laws, imposing a $2,500 civil penalty, and imposing an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing on July 17, 2017, was held on the same day that the court granted Jones' motion for summary disposition. The hearing followed by a status conference on August 17, 2016. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Kansas Division of Criminal Justice.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (2014).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kansas Department of Justice Criminal Division, and the Kansas State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
