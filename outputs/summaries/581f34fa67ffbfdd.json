  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against a Guilford County man accused of neglecting his son.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that, on April 3, 2017, Keith was terminated from his father-in-law's custody on the basis of neglect.  According to the complaint, the court found that respondent had failed to provide reasonable progress in his case plan and failed to comply with the court's recommendation to terminate his parental rights.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court improperly terminated respondent-father's parental rights because he had not provided sufficient support for Keith since he came into the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  The complaint further alleges that respondent's prior involvement with Child Protective Services and a history of domestic violence affected his ability to care for Keith.  As a result of his failure to provide sufficient support to Keith, he was unable to participate in the DVIP program.  Additionally, as alleged, respondent delayed taking a new drug test after providing three diluted samples, which he delayed taking by 36 hours, which could suggest an attempt on his part to manipulate the results of the drug test.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Keith has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay $28,000.00 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains with respect to his release from custody.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Keith, charging him with violating Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder of the Exchange Act, and with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  It also charged the father and mother with violating the anti-deterrent provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(b)(5) and (3) of Section 15 (a)(2).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced that it would conduct a parallel criminal investigation against the father.  Among other things, the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office."
