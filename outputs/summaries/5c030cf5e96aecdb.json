  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two defendants in an ongoing workers' compensation case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Charles Poole Jr., a former laborer at Guy Hopkins Construction Company, failed to prove a change in condition or ability to perform the job duties associated with jobs listed by the vocational rehabilitation counselor.  According to the complaint, in 2003, Mr. Poole was awarded temporary total disability (TTD) benefits, reasonable and necessary medical treatment, and vocational rehabilitation services related to the 2003 workplace incident.  In 2006, the federal district court for New Orleans entered a judgment that permanently and totally disabled (TTD) benefits were not entitled to him.  As set forth in the SEC's Complaint, the TTD award is based on the totality of the evidence, both physical and medical evidence, and the determination that he cannot be rehabilitated due to his age, education level, reliance on narcotic pain medication, and long absence from the work place.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's Judgment, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains their claims for TTD and TTD benefits, and orders them to pay civil penalties and attorney fees in the amount of $1,802.66 per month. The Commission's Final Judgment also prohibits the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and requires the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest in the amounts of civil penalties, attorney fees, and officer-and-director bars.  Finally, the Commission has agreed to a settlement where it will determine whether to impose a permanent injunction, impose a conduct-based injunction, and pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  It has also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 bar.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-2071 (Feb. 6, 2019).  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter, the Office of Worker's Compensation, the Department of Education, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, and to the appointment of a receiver."
