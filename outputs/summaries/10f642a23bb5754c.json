  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Norex Petroleum Limited (Norex), a resident of Alberta, Canada, against five defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on February 26, 2002, the defendants sought a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other relief.  The complaint alleges that defendants wrested away the majority interest in a Russian oil company with significant proven reserves and, concomitantly, deprived the customers of hundreds of millions of dollars in profits and dividends as part of a massive scheme to take control of the company.  Norexp's complaint also alleges that the defendants failed to consider whether the relevant federal statute of limitations should apply, and whether it was time-barred by the applicable laws of the foreign states where the causes of action accrued.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On March 7, 2011, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Manhattan, alleging that defendants had violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act by filing a false and misleading complaint with the SEC, and by failing to timely file a timely action in state court.  As a result, the complaint was dismissed on the basis of insufficient evidence, and the court granted the defendants' motion for leave to appeal, without having to rule on the merits of the case. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Marc Blau. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Scoggins. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alberta Securities Commission, the Canadian Securities Inspection Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the U.K. Secret Service in this matter."
