  "summary": "On May 6, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a judgment against Keith Schwam, a former assistant commissioner for the New York City Department of Investigations and former director of the Department's Marshal's Bureau, for a variety of alleged constitutional violations relating to the termination of Plaintiff's tenure as a city marshal.  According to the court's order, Schwam consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $1,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  The court also ordered Schwam to pay a civil penalty of $2,500.  Schwam agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Schwam.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants agreed to permanent injunctions, to pay civil penalties of $500,000, and to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains.  As a result, the court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, a temporary injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 9, 2019 the court entered a final judgment ordering a new trial on the matter of whether to grant or deny Schwam's motion for a judgment as to whether to proceed with a civil action against him, ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a municipal agency, and ordering a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply as a municipal marshal after his term expires in December 2013.  It also granted the city's request for an asset freeze and a bar prohibiting Schwam from soliciting investments in the municipal securities industry.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, and the Department of Justice."
