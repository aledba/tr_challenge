  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Williams Companies, Inc., a publicly-traded energy company, and its former CEO, Alan Armstrong, in a securities fraud case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Williams Companies and Armstrong violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to disclose to investors that they were in merger discussions with ETE, and that ETE was not engaged in any merger discussions at the time.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants did not disclose to the SEC that they had discussed a potential merger with Williams when they had not discussed it with the company.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, these statements were false because they were consistent with the representations made in the complaint.  For example, the Complaint alleges that, in May 2015, when ETE announced that it was going to merge with Williams, Armstrong told the company that he was not interested in a merger and that it would consider acquiring the remainder of the company's outstanding units.   The Complaint further alleges that Armstrong told ETE that he did not believe that a merger was imminent and that he had \"an obligation to disclose such a matter to the company.\"  The complaint alleges, however, that Armstrong had no duty to disclose the merger discussions and that the company had not yet made a decision about whether or not to acquire the remaining shares of its parent company, Williams Partners L.P.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Williams Companies consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $1,078, which is equal to the amount of its ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov website to quickly and easily identify whether they are registered professionals and to quickly check whether they have sufficient background to spot potential conflicts of interest.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Armstrong and Armstrong.  Among other things, Armstrong pleaded guilty to"
