  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a trademark infringement action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants misrepresented to investors that their products would be used in a variety of ways to improve the smell of users' cars.  For example, the complaint alleges that, while some of the products in question are recognizable, others are not.  In addition, the SEC alleges that defendants' use of the \"Black Ice\" and \"Boardwalk Breeze\" scents misled investors into believing that the products were actually manufactured by the same company.  As a result of these misrepresentations, the Defendants have agreed to settle the SEC's action by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants have consented to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the federal and state registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 5, 2017, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Gottschall of the United States District Court in Manhattan granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment against the defendants.  To determine whether the defendants are entitled to a permanent injunction, the court ordered the defendants to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.   The court also granted the parties' request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder, and ordered the companies to pay disgorgements of $2,078, which is equal to the amount of money they have already spent on the alleged violations.  Finally, the Court granted the companies' motion to request a preliminary injunction against further violation of Section 15(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 12b3-1 and Rule 15a-4 thereunder and ordered them to pay civil penalties of $20,000 and $10,000, respectively. \u00c2\u00a0The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from"
