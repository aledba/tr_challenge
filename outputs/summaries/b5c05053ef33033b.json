  "summary": "On July 18, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas entered a final judgment against Iridescent Networks, Inc. and its parent company, AT&T Mobility, LLC, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that, from at least 2013 through at least 2016, the defendants failed to disclose that prior art networks transmit data packets in an ad hoc manner, with each packet taking an unpredictable route to its destination.  According to the complaint, this is undesirable because some applications require significantly more bandwidth than others to provide tolerable levels of quality of service.  For example, the complaint alleges that the defendants misrepresented to the court that the \"high quality\" of service connection\" is a term that requires a minimum level of quality to be assured from end-to-end based on the requirements of the application.  In fact, according to the SEC, the defendant failed to adequately account for this fact when he and his co-defendant, Ericsson Inc., filed a complaint in federal court in Texas in July 2016, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.    In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by David A. Kasper and Mr. Werner, and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Insurance, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Air Force Criminal Investigations, the FBI's Cyber Unit, the Postal Inspection Service, and other relevant agencies in this matter."
