  "summary": "On September 22, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against New York City school district defendants for failing to adequately fund school education.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that defendants failed to adequately assess the adequacy of school funding and funding for the school districts at issue.  According to the complaint, defendants misrepresented to the court that the funding they provided was constitutionally adequate because it exceeded the amount proposed by then-Governor Pataki in 2006, and that additional funding would be provided to provide students with a sound basic education at a reasonable price.  In fact, the complaint alleges, defendants' claims were not supported by sufficient evidence to determine whether the funding actually provided to the affected school districts.  As a result, defendants were not adequately compensated for their failure to adequately address the issues raised in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Additionally, defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years, from participating in any form of education, including the purchase, promotion or promotion of any educational product, including reading, writing, math, science, or social studies.  Defendants also agreed to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $100,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, respectively.  Finally, the court granted a temporary restraining order against defendants and ordered them to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest to be determined by the court at a later date.  On October 6, 2017, the SEC filed a second amended complaint, this time alleging that defendants had failed to meet its duty under the federal education law to provide for the safety and well-being of schoolchildren.  This amended complaint also alleges that defendant violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by failing to provide sufficient funding to adequately support the school district at issue and that defendants violated Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 15a-3 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 10 and Rule 15b2-1, and a penalty against defendants for further violation of Section 13(b).  The complaint also seeks an injunction against future violations"
