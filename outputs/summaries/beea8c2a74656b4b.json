  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against Woischke Enterprises LLC, a Minnesota-based real-estate broker and financial consultant, for failing to pay for services performed without a broker's license.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnesota, Stursberg & Fine entered into a contractual-payment duty agreement with a Pennsylvania-based broker to provide services for which it lacked a broker\u2019s license. The complaint alleges that, in violation of the federal securities laws, the broker-dealer agreed to pay a $10,000 penalty and to be barred from participating in the sale or refinancing of a property. The court held that the contract was void because it did not require a broker to perform the services performed under the contract.  The complaint also alleges that the broker's agreement was void as a matter of law because the broker lacked a required license to perform those services.  In a parallel action, the Minnesota Department of Commerce today announced that it had obtained an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the receiver consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the receiver from violating the contract and orders him or her to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. The receiver agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the contract, which is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Welshhans and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Minnesota Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Minnesota Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
