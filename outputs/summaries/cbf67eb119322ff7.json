  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in a case brought by the Sierra Club.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder and the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Rule 206(3) thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the SEC's representations, the agency failed to adequately consider the issues raised in the complaint, including that there was no evidence to support EPA's determination that the \"best performing\" power plants could reliably measure emissions until the end of startup. In addition, the complaint alleges that EPA did not adequately analyze which power plants were the best performing until the final rule was implemented, thus depriving Petitioners of the opportunity to raise their two objections during the notice-and-comment period.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against one of the defendants in the case.  On June 25, 2013, the SEC issued a final rule that permanently enjoins the agency from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders it to conduct a conduct-based investigation of the matter. The SEC previously issued an order requiring the agency to conduct an independent review of its compliance with the federal reporting requirements. The court's order also requires the SEC to provide an accounting of the agency's compliance with its reporting requirements, which includes the accuracy of the reporting requirements and the adequacy of the information available to the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 16-1349 (Nov. 19, 2014).  The Court's order against the SEC, which is continuing its litigation against the agency, orders that the SEC comply with the court's orders, and that the court appoint a receiver to determine whether to issue an order imposing a temporary restraining order or order suspending the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a final order permanently enjoining the SEC from violating the above-mentioned provisions and ordering the SEC and the Department of Justice to jointly and severally supervise the enforcement of these provisions. The Commission has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by"
