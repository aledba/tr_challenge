  "summary": "On March 17, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Social Security Administration against Shannon E. McHenry, a California-based hair stylist, alleging that she suffered from degenerative disc disease and fibromyalgia, and that she was not disabled.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that McHenry suffered from back pain, stress, lack of sleep, and depression.  According to the complaint, McHenry told her medical providers that she had moved in with her mother, who had to do \"pretty much everything\" for her, but she needed help washing her hair.  McHenry also claimed that her back pain started in 1990 after a car accident, and in 2005, an MRI of her lumbar spine showed \"[m]ild disc space narrowing at L1-2 and mild spondylitic spurring at L3-4\" during the relevant time period.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, however, this finding was not supported by substantial evidence, and McHenry was not credible about her limitations.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New York today announced criminal charges against McHenry.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's order, the SEC consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins McHenry from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders McHenry to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Additionally, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, which is subject to court approval.  On March 18, the Commission issued an order suspending McHenry and ordering her to return to her salon, where she will be assisted by a licensed clinical trial attorney, and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Jennifer P. Cohen and supervised by Marc Blau of the New York Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Cohen.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
