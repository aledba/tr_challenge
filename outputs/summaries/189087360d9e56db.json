  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against defendant Braulio M. Castillo, Jr., who was convicted of first-degree murder, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Va., Castillo was convicted on three counts of felony wire fraud and one count of aiding and abetting the other two counts of wire fraud.  The SEC alleges that Castillo agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Castillo also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  In a parallel action, the Virginia Attorney General's Office today announced that it would conduct a parallel criminal proceeding against Castillo.  On March 21, 2014, the court granted Castillo\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order against him from further violating the antifraud provisions of Section 16(a)(1) and 16(b)(3) of The Securities Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 16a-11 thereunder, and ordered Castillo to comply with the order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Castillo consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requiring him to provide a civil penalty equal to the amount of his pay.   The court also denied Castillo and his wife the right to a preliminary injunction against further violation of the securities laws, ordering the court to determine whether to impose a permanent injunction, imposing a conduct-based injunction, and appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation.  A hearing on March 24, 2015, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  Counsel for Castillo questioned Castillo about his own experience with wire fraud, and Castillo replied that he did not have any background in the matter.  He also asked Castillo if he had ever met a person who had attempted or committed a felony and that he had never been convicted of a felony. Castillo replied, \"No, I have never met anyone who has attempted to commit a felony, but I have met someone who has done so.  I have no background in this matter.\"  The hearing was conducted in the absence of any evidence, and the jury deliberated for approximately two hours before the judgment was entered"
