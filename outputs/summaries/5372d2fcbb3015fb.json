  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Colleges of Education for defrauding the Department of Education.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, from at least July 1, 2002 through at least June 6, 2011, Stevens\u2013Henager College, Inc. and its apparent successor, CollegeAmerica Denver, Inc., violated the federal securities laws by failing to comply with certain of the requirements of the federal financial aid laws.  According to the complaint, Stevens-Henager allegedly made materially false and misleading statements to the Commission on Colleges and Schools in its 2007 and 2010 filings with the Commission.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Colleges made false and fraudulent claims for payment in its 2010 and 2010 PPAs, and failed to inform the Commission of Colleges' compliance with the federal requirements.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, the Colleges consented to the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  Finally, the Commission has agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 20, 2011).  The Commission's investigation was conducted by John H. Krause and supervised by Marc Blau of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Brooks and Ms. Wride. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov."
