  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Allen Bocteemus Franks, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for voluntary manslaughter.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least March 2015 through at least June 2017, defendant repeatedly denied or attempted to avoid a death sentence.  According to the complaint, defendant told his counsel that he would \"let her beat 'em before I would ever put my hands on her.\"  The complaint further alleges that defendant told one of the probation officers that he did not kill the victim.  He also allegedly told the probation officer that the victim had \"bull['\u0080\u0099] bull[\u2000\u009c).  The court also found that defendant had provided ineffective assistance in conceding his guilt during his police interview.  In a parallel action, on May 6, 2019, a federal district court in Manhattan entered a judgment against defendant that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $400, which is equal to the amount of restitution ordered by the court.  Additionally, defendant agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of a penny, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The judgment also prohibits defendant from associating with or practicing with any third-party, including a registered representative, a probation officer, or an attorney.  On May 8, 2018, the court granted a request for a temporary restraining order against defendant and ordered him to return to court on May 10, 2019.
