  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Louisiana against EIP, which alleges that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, alleges that EIP violated the federal securities laws by failing to adequately assess the impact of the Corps\u2019 mitigation project on its wetlands.  EIP also alleges that the Corps failed to consider whether EIP\u2019s bank had sufficient reserves to offset any potential environmental harm.  According to the complaint, EIP failed to show that it had a sufficient reserve to offset the loss of its banked credits.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their respective profits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged violations.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Mascianica entered final judgments permanently enjoining EIP from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordering EIP to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is twice as much as the amount EIP has already agreed to pay.   The final judgments also order EIP and the other defendants to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (1962) and Litigation Bulletin No. 206-cv (2010).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Cottrill and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office."
