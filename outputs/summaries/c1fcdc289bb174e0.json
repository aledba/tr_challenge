  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Keller Independent School District for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from 2006 through 2010, Keller ISD was liable for the alleged mistreatment of Little T.R. by Dan Evans, an instructor with a master\u2019s degree in special education and nearly two decades of experience teaching disabled students.  According to the complaint, Evans and his classroom aide, Rebecca Bruton, raised the issue of whether or not to grant a temporary restraining order (JMOL) to prevent the school district from violating the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Bruton consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for New York announced criminal charges against Evans and Bruton.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that the district court found that Keller was liable under Section 504 of the RA and Section 504 for aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and that Bruton was liable as a trustee under Section 5 of the Exchange Act for acting as an unregistered broker-dealer in violation of Rule 13a-14 thereunder of Section 17(a)(2)(A) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder under Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 12b3-1, 12a-11, and 12b13-13 thereunder; and that, in the alternative, the court could not determine whether to grant the JMOL based on reasonable, fair-minded, and impartial jurors' findings.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2013.   The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against all defendants, and a penny stock bar against each defendant. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas and Amy C. McKinley of the Boston Regional Office, with assistance from David A. Cohen of the Division of Education's Office of Education and Advocacy."
