  "summary": "On March 7, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) for terminating the parental rights of four of its children.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the DHS violated the antifraud provisions of Section 41-3-423(1)(a) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its order, the court found that DHS failed to provide reasonable efforts to prevent C.B. from being removed from his or her mother\u2019s care and custody at the time of her termination. The court also found that, based on the circumstances surrounding her prior terminations of her parental rights, Mother was at risk for abuse and neglect, and the court improperly conducted termination proceedings at the show cause hearing.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, DHS consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins DHS from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders DHS to provide preservation or reunification services to Mother, and orders the Department to provide expedited and reasonable assistance in finding a cause for termination. DHS also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $50,000.  DHS has also issued an order suspending the registration of certain of its own children. The SEC is continuing its investigation into whether DHS acted improperly in terminating mother's parental rights by failing to provide timely and sufficient information to the court about the issues surrounding the termination of parental rights. The litigation will be led by Senior Trial Counsel Jodi Burk and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2019."
