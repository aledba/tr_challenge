  "summary": "On May 9, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi entered a final judgment against D'Bryus Story, Jr., a convicted felon, for his role in the November 12, 2013 murders of Tavoris Marshall and Kevion Gorman in Cleveland, Mississippi.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, Story was the first officer on the scene at approximately 2:00 a.m. when Marshall and Gorman were shot and killed in the home of Story's grandmother, Herdicine Marshall.  The complaint alleges that Story, who was a regular visitor to the home, immediately observed the layout of Marshall's bedroom with his first purchase of Xanax pills, thereby seeing the shoe box where Marshall kept the drugs and money.  As alleged in the complaint, Story then followed Johnson into the bedroom and saw Gorman and his son, who were also shot.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Story, Johnson, and others for their roles in the murders.  On November 13, 2013, a jury found Story guilty of conspiracy, capital murder, and kidnapping with a firearm enhancement, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  Johnson, Gorman, and their son, Favian Vaughn, consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and requires them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $50,000 and $100,000, respectively.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Story agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  He also agreed to a five-year officer-director bar and a three-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in post-conviction proceedings.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Burt of the Atlanta Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mississippi Department of Criminal Justice, the FBI, and the FBI in this matter."
