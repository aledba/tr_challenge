  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Midwest Palliative Hospice and Care Center, Inc., a Glenview, Illinois-based hospice and care center, on consent for the purpose of granting a charitable property tax exemption.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on Dec. 10, 2016, Midwest raised the issue of whether the hospice care pavilion should qualify for a tax exemption based on its charitable use.  The complaint alleges that, in 2013, Midwest began the construction of an inpatient hospice pavilion on the same plot of land as the palliative care center.  As alleged in the complaint, the pavilion was not used exclusively for charitable purposes in 2013.  In fact, the complaint alleges, Midwest failed to meet its burden to show that the property was being used for a charitable purpose in 2013 because, among other reasons, it saw a need for providing end-of-life care for patients who could not be adequately cared for in their homes.  Midwest's complaint charges the Department of Revenue with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Midwest consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and a $20,000 penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by John Rymas. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Secretary of State's Office, and the Illinois Attorney General's Office in this matter."
