  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil injunctive action brought by an out-of-state company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that, in 1996, Arapahoe Aero, Inc., a Colorado-based manufacturer of airplane engines, engaged in a nationwide marketing campaign that targeted Colorado residents.  According to the complaint, the company's website and online service manuals allegedly contained misleading information about the safety and effectiveness of its products.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the company failed to adequately disclose to its customers that it had engaged in an aggressive marketing campaign targeting Colorado residents, and failed to properly inspect and replace the magnetos\u2019 distributor gears when it serviced the aircraft in September 2009 and again in December 2013.    The complaint further alleges that in 2010, a federal district court in Alabama granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order halting the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the company to pay a civil penalty of $500,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $5,200, $10,000, and $1,500, respectively. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 9, 2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Denver Regional Office, under the supervision of Jan Folena. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Department of Insurance, and the Colorado Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
