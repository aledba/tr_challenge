  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against a Lawrence man accused of orchestrating a series of high-speed carjackings that left at least four people injured.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Lawrence, Massachusetts, on January 9, 2009, Robert G. Gonzalez was shot and killed by C.J. Cauris of Lawrence.  The complaint alleges that the defendant, who was not an engineer but who had been trained as an engineer, used a combination of cell phone records and video recordings to create a false and misleading account of the events leading up to and during the shooting.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendant used the video recording to convince a jury that he had been involved in the shooting in retaliation for a fight in which the victim punched out the defendant's tooth.  He also allegedly told the jury that the victim had a \"cloak of credibility\" when he had not paid the full purchase price for the car.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Gonzalo P. Rodriguez, ordering Rodriguez to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Rodriguez also agreed to be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Rodriguez consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer and director bar, and bars him from participating in any future securities offering or offering of securities.  On February 19, 2010, the court granted Rodriguez's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return to his home state of New Jersey, where he resides.  A hearing on February 24, 2011, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Kasper of the Boston Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson, Ms. Pypka, and Mr. Grossman. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
