Army Corps of Engineers' approval of a project to store more water in the Chatfield Reservoir in Colorado.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Denver, the Corps issued an order in April 2014 requiring the Corps to consider whether it could safely and expeditiously consider all reasonable alternatives to the project.  The complaint alleges that the Corps failed to adequately consider the environmental impacts of the proposed discharge of dredge and fill, and failed to consider the practicalities of the alternative.  In its order, the court also found that, when evaluating the Corps' decision, it was not arbitrary or capricious because it did not consider the \"legitimate\" objectives of the project when it approved it.  For example, the order expressly prohibits the Corps from excluding dredge or fill from the scope of its CWA analysis.

The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and injunctive relief against the Corps, as well as an officer-and-director bar against the agency from participating in the issuance of any emergency relief, including an asset freeze, a penny stock bar, and an officer and director bar against serving as officers and directors of a public company.  Additionally, the complaint seeks an injunction against future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of"
