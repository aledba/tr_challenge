  "summary": "On July 11, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who agreed to pay $750,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Las Vegas, Nevada, alleges that, in 1999, a federal district court in Nevada granted a temporary restraining order against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder. The court also granted a preliminary injunction against the defendant and ordered him to comply with the court\u2019s order.  According to the complaint, the court did not consider the fact that the defendant had previously admitted to downloading and distributing American Heist, a Hollywood feature film with a substantial budget and a recognizable cast, as a significant factor in his decision to grant the injunction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Turchin.

It also found that, despite having previously agreed to settle the SEC action, he did not file a responsive pleading for a judgment that would permanently enjoin him from using the internet to reproduce, copy or publish American Heist on any form of digital media, including music, movies, and television shows.  On July 18, 2017, the Court granted the SEC request for a temporary injunction, ordered a hearing on the matter, and issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an injunction against further violations of the anti-piracy provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(b) of"
