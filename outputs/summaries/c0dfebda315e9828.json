  "summary": "On August 28, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan entered a final judgment in favor of New Vision Home Health Care, Inc., a home healthcare provider that was previously barred by the federal government from making claims for reimbursement under the Medicare program.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, New Vision, a for-profit healthcare provider, and its affiliated entities, TrustSolutions LLC and Appellee N. Coll. Hill, Inc. (collectively, \"TrustSolutions\"), raised the issue of whether New Vision had exhausted its administrative remedies and was entitled to mandamus relief.  The complaint alleges that New Vision failed to meet the requirements of the federal statute and was barred from suing on claims that were not subject to the federal law.  New Vision also alleges that the SEC found that the defendants had failed to fulfill their obligations under the federal statutes and were barred from making payments on those claims based on their failure to comply with the agency\u2019s 2013 decision.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $35,872.28, far less than the $4 million-plus extrapolated by New Vision.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against New Vision for its role in this matter.  On August 29, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a judgment ordering New Vision to disgorge $41,675.65 in ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  It also obtained a temporary restraining order, which prohibits New Vision from violating the federal securities laws, and an order appointing a receiver to determine the amount of any civil penalties that may be imposed upon New Vision pursuant to the court order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Werner."
