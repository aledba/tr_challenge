  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 16, 2017 entered a final judgment against Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC (\"Mercedes-Benz\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1794 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, on January 21, 2016, Hanna purchased a new Mercedes Benz automobile for $52,948, including sales tax, license fees and other fees, shortly before the car was declared a total loss by her insurer. According to the complaint, the car immediately exhibited a problem with its rear seatbelt, requiring Hanna to surrender it and enter into a retainer agreement. The complaint further alleges that the car's owner, Thomas Lepper, conducted an inspection shortly after the January 2016 offer and paid $2,137.86 to his first expert, who was not named in the complaint. The court found that the fees incurred by Hanna were reasonable and reasonable and should be included in an award of fees under the agreed-upon settlement.  In a parallel action, on April 24, 2019, a federal court in Los Angeles issued an order granting the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Hanna, freezing her assets, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of two times her attorney's fees and costs.  On May 9, 2014, the court issued a final order requiring the defendants to comply with the court's order, ordering them to pay $60,000 in attorney fees, $172,712.50 of which was deemed reasonable by the court, and a $1,000 civil penalty for the parties to be determined by court motion if the parties could not agree.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay civil penalties, and pay disgorgement of $2.137 million, and impose a $100,000 penalty.  Mercedes- Benz agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against further violations of the charged provision. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing scheduled for June 15, 2017, was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. EST. on May 17, 2017. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the California Department of Securities and Exchange Commission (CDSC) in this matter."
