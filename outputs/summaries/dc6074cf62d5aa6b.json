  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming today entered a final judgment against Michael Paul Montano, Jr., a convicted felon who pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree murder and one count of mutilation of dead human bodies as part of a plea agreement. The court accepted his pleas but rejected the agreement\u2019s joint sentencing recommendation.  According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in federal court in Wyoming, Montano told the court that he had shot Mr. Fortuna and Mr. Brewer and had \"begged like a bitch\" before he cut up their bodies in his bathtub with a saw. The complaint alleges that Montano had been a \"monster\" and a threat to the community.  The complaint further alleges that, when confronted by a deputy who confronted Montano about the alleged misconduct, the defendant replied, \u201cI gotta get rid of some bodies.\u201d  Montano also allegedly told the deputy that he would take care of the victims.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Wyo. today announced criminal charges against Montano.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the court agreed to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins Montano from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Montano to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation entered a guilty plea in a parallel criminal case. The final judgment orders Sansone to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and imposes a $20,000 bar.  Monto has agreed to a $25,000 penalty. The district court also agreed to an officer-and-director bar and a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of incarceration. The order also prohibits him from associating with any person who has been convicted of a felony and from soliciting or providing assistance in the purchase, sale, or promotion of a firearm. The judge will determine the appropriate sentence based on the facts of the case."
