  "summary": "On May 22, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Shane Michael Warner, Jr., a California man who was convicted of attempted murder in 2011 for his role in a Las Vegas nightclub shooting.  The court found that Warner violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, Warner acted in self-defense by firing a single round into a group of people on the dance floor of LaSalle's Bar in Las Vegas, Nevada. The court also found that the defendant did not intend to kill all of the people in the \"kill zone.\" The court further found that, contrary to what the court had previously ruled, the defendant fired multiple shots into the crowd, including at least one round that hit a woman and her baby in the chest.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Warner. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Warner with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"). The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Warner has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against future violations. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 23, 2020, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Warner, ordered him to surrender his passport, and issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The order also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with an offering of a penny stock, including securities in exchange for a share of the proceeds of a public offering of the penny stock.  A hearing on May 24, 2020 is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the Nevada State Attorney General's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Criminal Investigations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigation Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment in a real estate development project."
