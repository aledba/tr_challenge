According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon on September 26 and unsealed on September 27, 2018 in the Eastern District of Washington, Pettibon and Adams agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.

As a result of the court's order, Adams was barred from appearing before the SEC as a jury and from appearing as an attorney or practicing before the court as a public figure.  Additionally, the court ruled that the victim could review the grand jury notes to refresh her recollection but that \"she may not read [the grand-jury notes] aloud and [they] will not be introduced into evidence and the jury will not receive [them].
