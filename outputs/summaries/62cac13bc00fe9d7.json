  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against R.R. for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Riverside, California, alleges that, from at least 2003 through at least 2006, the defendant and father of three children, Ro.R., had spent a substantial amount of time with S.H. as his son, spending most of his time with his wife and extended family.  According to the complaint, the court found that, based on substantial evidence in the record, R.H.'s relationship with his son was developed primarily through visits with his mother, who had abandoned the children with the maternal grandmother, and had engaged in domestic violence with her live-in boyfriend.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant had provided paternal love and care since he was three years old, even though he had not been able to provide for the children since birth.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, however, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties against each of them.

The court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the Section 15a-3, and ordered that the defendants be enjoined from violating Section 15A of the Exchange Act and Rule 15b3-1 thereunder, as well as from violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act, Section 9(b)(2) and Rule 9b-3 thereunder; and Section 15B-5(a).  The defendants have also agreed to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.
