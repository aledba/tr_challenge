According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, on October 16, 2014, the defendant's husband went to a police precinct station house in Queens and reported that the defendant had assaulted him.  The complaint alleges that, while the husband was being questioned by officers from Internal Affairs, he allegedly told the defendant that he had learned that her alleged acts would violate an existing order of protection and that she would be placed under arrest.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the defendants agreed to the admission of the audio recording without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In addition, the complaint charges the defendant with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-1 thereunder and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a penalty equal to or equal to the amount of any civil penalty imposed by the court on the defendant.  For further information, see People v. Ferro, 60 N.Y.2d at 1172, 1183, 882 N.E.2D.

In its complaint, the SEC alleges that the defendants consented to entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to comply with the court's order, and ordering the defendants to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On October 26, 2015, the court granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the officers to return to the station house to conduct an internal affairs investigation that was conducted by the Office of Inspector General and the Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations, with the assistance of the Assistant District Attorney.
