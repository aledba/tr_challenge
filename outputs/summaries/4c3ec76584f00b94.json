  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of terminating parental rights to Marilyn W., a daughter of Trena S. and Wyatt W. The court found that, in the approximately 20 months that Marilyn was in OCS custody, she was in need of aid.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in New York, the defendants failed to follow through on their prior conduct in deciding to terminate their parental rights.  The court also found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that they violated the right to a reasonable reunification and rehabilitation program.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.  As alleged in the SEC's complaint, in addition to failing to comply with the requirements of the federal court order, the Defendants violated Section 13(b)(5) and 13(a)(2) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 13 of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Additionally, Defendants agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and to pay an officer and director bar in the amount of $100,000.  On the same day, the court granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return to their respective homes.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services."
