  "summary": "On November 16, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Quindarius Allen, a Shreveport, Louisiana man who was convicted of second degree murder and attempted second-degree murder in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered an order suspending Allen from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert in firearms identification.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, Allen was arrested and indicted by a grand jury on charges of second and third degree murder. Allen pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to 20 years in prison, with a five-year officer-and-director bar, and a 10-year prison term. Allen has agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Timar Clark, Eric Farquhar, and Carla White of the New Orleans Regional Office. The litigation will be led by David Bonillas and Timothy Clark. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations."
