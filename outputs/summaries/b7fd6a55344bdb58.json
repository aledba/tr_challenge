  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska yesterday entered default against two defendants in an action brought by the Nebraska Department of Commerce and the Nebraska Secretary of State's Office.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Omaha, Nebraska, alleges that Kevin Royal, a resident of Otoe County, Nebraska who lives in Nebraska, and his predecessors in interest in Nebraska Public Power District (OPPD) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that Royal sought to quiet title in the 200-foot right-of-way and that OPPD had acquired it by way of adverse possession in 1869. According to the complaint, however, OPPD did not acquire the right of way by adverse possession and OPPD was not entitled to title in its name. Instead, Royal sought title to the 200 feet of the right, which he claimed OPPD owned by default. OPPD agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of default without admitting or denying Royal\u2019s allegations. Royal also agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins OPPD from future violations of Section 9(a)(1) and 9(b)(2)(A)(3) of The Securities Act, and orders OPPD to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Royal.  On March 17, 20, 2018, a federal district court in Nebraska entered default on all of Royal's claims against OPPD, finding that Royal had violated Section 9 (a)(2) and (3) and 5(c) thereunder of the federal securities laws. The court also ordered Royal to comply with a court order requiring him to show cause and effect in a civil proceeding.  Royal agreed to the judgment, which permanently enjoined him from violating Section 9 of the Exchange Act and Rule 9b2-1 thereunder, and ordered him to pay civil penalties in the amount of $20,000. Royal has agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The district court also granted Royal the right to reapply in a matter of weeks after the court granted default on his other claims. The order also prohibits Royal from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States without a prior court finding that he or she is entitled to"
