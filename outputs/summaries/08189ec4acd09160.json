  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Nevell Group, Inc. (\"Nevell\"), a commercial construction contractor, for violating the right to compel arbitration.  According to the court's order, Nevell, who was employed by Nevell as a stocker-scrapper, filed a complaint in April 2015 alleging that he was not entitled to arbitration because he was a member of a collective bargaining agreement that provided for arbitration of wage and hour claims. The court found that Nevell violated Section 12(e) of the Contracting Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\") and Rule 12b-5 thereunder, and that the parties violated Section 17200 of the federal securities laws. Nevell also failed to comply with a court order requiring him to produce documents and contact information for the entire putative class of putative workers.

The judgment also prohibits Nevell from participating in the issuance of a subpoena or in the preparation of a demand package based on a class action, and prohibits him from participating as a broker-dealer in a case management conference.  On August 15, 2018, the Court of Appeal granted Nevell's motion for arbitration, without prejudice, to proceed with the filing of a class certification motion by June 8, 2018. The Court also granted the motion for injunctive relief, ordered a hearing on the matter, and appointed a receiver to determine whether to issue an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering the receiver to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver.
