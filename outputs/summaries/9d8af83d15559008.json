  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a North Carolina-based physician who was found liable for violating the broker-dealer exemption provision of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that, in March 2011, Pedro Hernandez, a registered physician, used an online portal called MedHunters to look for open medical positions in North Carolina. The complaint alleges that defendants entered into a contract with a hospital that required them to provide medical services to patients. According to the complaint, the hospital agreed to pay $902,259.66 in prejudgment interest, a $10,000 signing bonus, and a $49,500 monthly income guarantee. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In its judgment, the court found that the hospital violated the broker dealer exemption provision, and that defendants could not maintain a \"learned profession\" exemption under the new federal securities law.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $334,341.14. The judgment also prohibits defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offer of a new trial. The court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of $1,038,768, plus prejudgment interests of $2,065, and to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert C. Hannan of the U. S. District court for the Eastern District of South Carolina granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordered a preliminary injunction against further violations of the broker trader exemption provision. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
