  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the California Voter's Choice Act, S.B. 450, 2015, that permanently enjoins California from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against California from enforcing the federal election laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, the California Commission on Election Education and Advocacy (CIEA) issued an order imposing a preliminary injunction against California's implementation of the all-mailed ballot election system.  In its order, the Commission ruled that California had sufficient time between now and the November 2014 election to make the necessary changes.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, California consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining the Commission from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the Commission to conduct an independent examination of the Commission\u2019s findings, and ordering an injunction against future violations. The Commission issued its order in a parallel action, which is pending final approval by the court.  Among other things, the Court granted the Commission the right to request an injunction, which would have prevented California from implementing any pilot program to increase voter turnout for the general population but not for military personnel.  On the other hand, the court found that the Commission violated the First and Second Amendments of the United States Constitution by failing to impose reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions on California election law violations.  To learn more about the Commission on Elections, see Litigation Release No. 549 (2014).  The Commission also issued an Order suspending the registration of certain registered voters in the five opted-in counties of California.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burdick, Trina T.R. Heter, and Kurt L. Gottschall of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jeffrey Short and Trina Heter."
