  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Jersey City man accused of orchestrating a mass shooting that left one of his co-defendants dead.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Jersey, alleges that, from at least March 29, 2017 through September 12, 2017, defendant Shaquan \"Michael\" Hyppolite, of Jersey City, told the court that he had known Quan for about seven years and believed he was in jail at the time of the homicide. The complaint further alleges that the defendant initially told the police that he did not see the shooter, but later admitted to having seen the victim engaged in a conversation with three other men before the shooting.  According to the complaint, after the hearing, the defendant confronted the other men in the area and confronted them, telling them that he \"saw the shooter\" and \"Frank.\"  The complaint alleges that when the defendant was arrested and charged with a felony, he was subsequently incarcerated for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of N.J. today entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins defendants from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $1,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to comply with the court's orders, and requiring defendants to provide the court with a copy of the final judgment.  Additionally, defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any future issuance of a civil injunctive relief order, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Defendants also agreed to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively, for each of those violations.  To learn more about pretrial detention, see Criminal Justice Reform Report to the Governor and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey (ACLU).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Justice and the Office of Advocacy and Advocacy for the New Jersey Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Health and Human Services (OHHS).  In addition, the court granted the request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against future violations"
