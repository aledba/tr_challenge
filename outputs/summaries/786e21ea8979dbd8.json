  "summary": "On January 7, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina entered default judgment against Blue Ridge Health Services, Inc. (\"Blue Ridge\"), a North Carolina-based health care company, and its former owner, Lubna Reece, in a civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina on February 2, 2018, Blue Ridge and Reece agreed to settle the litigation by agreeing to pay $5,000 each.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  In its order, the court found that Blue Ridge violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Reece violated the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) and (3) of Exchange Act Rules 5(b)(5).  The court also ordered Blue Ridge to comply with the reporting provision of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a default judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On February 19, 2019 the court granted default judgment to Blue Ridge in its action against Reece.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Gregory S. Williams.
