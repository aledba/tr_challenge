  "summary": "On May 9, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against J&J Consumer Inc. (\"J&J\"), a defendant in numerous personal injury and wrongful death actions pending in state and federal courts all over the country.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York City, alleges that, in February 2019, J&&J filed a motion to transfer 2,400 of its claims for bankruptcy relief from district court jurisdiction to state court for the purpose of expediting the filing of the claims.  J&j's motion, filed on April 18, 2019 and unsealed on May 23, 2019 in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, seeks a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other relief.  According to the complaint, the emergency provisional transfer motion was improper and attempts to undo that which this court has already ordered.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants had previously requested immediate and ex parte relief in connection with the debtors' bankruptcy, and that, without admitting or denying the allegations in the emergency motion, the defendants have not moved for transfer of the cases.  As a result, the relief sought by the complaint is unlikely to be granted.  For example, the SEC alleges that certain of the defendants removed and sought transfer of lawsuits asserting claims directly against them, including claims directly related to the bankruptcy of another entity under \u00a7 157(b)(5).  The complaint also alleges that some of the Debtors' lawsuits were filed on the eve of trial and delayed for lengthy delays for victims with rapidly deteriorating health.  Finally, the Complaint alleges that defendants supplied cosmetic talc for use in some J&Js products, including Johnson's Baby Powder.   The Complaint further alleges that in a number of cases, the court had previously granted immediate, ex-parte relief, which is rarely granted, because each is \u201crelated to\u201d the bankruptcy or related to a related party's bankruptcy.  Specifically, the Commission of Inspections and Examinations has issued an order requiring the court to consider the legitimacy of a provisional transfer of certain of these claims, and requiring the parties to file a single brief in response to the Commission's order.  On May 24, 2019 the Commission issued an Order appointing a receiver to oversee the orderly and efficient resolution of these matters. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Order appointing the receiver will determine the amount of relief that will be granted to the receiver.
