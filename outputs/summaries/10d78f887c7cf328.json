  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment against Midland Funding LLC, a New Jersey-based credit card issuer, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on December 12, 2016, filed in federal district court in Newark, New Jersey, Synchrony Bank agreed to settle a class action brought by a Pennsylvania resident who owed money on a J.C. Penney-branded credit card account.  The complaint alleges that, on October 22, 2017, Midland Bank sold its rights to arbitrate with Mr. Lance and agreed to pay $1,065.78 in arbitration, which is required by federal law.  Midland also agreed to collect the credit card debt as part of an agreement signed by the bank.  In a parallel action, on January 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Central District of Pennsylvania entered a judgment against the bank, agreeing to compel arbitration of the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court also ordered Midland to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which would be equal to the amount owed to the bank in the class action action action.  On January 26, 2019, the SEC issued an order suspending Midland's registration with the SEC, freezing the assets of Midland, and ordering the bank to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Department of Banking, and the New York Office of Financial Regulation."
