  "summary": "On February 21, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Florida entered a final judgment against Paul Vernon, a California-based financial services company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, California, alleges that, in May 2013, Paul Vernon opened two accounts for himself and one for his company, Project Investors, Inc., in order to obtain access to Blue Shield of California\u2019s provider network at the rates that Blue Shield negotiated with health care providers.  According to the complaint, Vernon used his services to convert more than $8 million of Cryptsy's customers' Bitcoin into cash, which was deposited into Vernon's personal bank account.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Vernon consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California today announced criminal charges against Vernon.  On February 22, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Vernon, charging him with violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 17a-1 thereunder, and seeking a permanent injunction against Vernon and Cryptsy from violating those provisions, as well as an order appointing a receiver to take control of the company.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the assets of Vernon, Cryptsy, and Kroma Makeup EU, LLC, which is registered as a money services company with the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Lara S. Mehraban. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
