  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware today entered a final judgment against Amgen Inc. and Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New York LLC in a patent infringement case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that Amgen and Piramal violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it violated the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of this federal securities law.  According to the complaint, Amgen's claims were based on testimony from an expert who reviewed the claims and found that, contrary to what Amgen claimed, the final judgment did not apply to all of the claims.  For example, the court found that the pregelatinized starch in the claimed product does not meet the binder and disintegrant limitations, that it is not a binder, that the product is a diluent, that is, a product that contains a specific type of starch, or that has a specific chemical composition that is important to the invention.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Amgen also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert Bosch of the Philadelphia Regional Office issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney, and ordering Amgen to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000 plus prejudgment interest of $100,000.  A hearing on May 26, 2018 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Patent and Trademark Abuse, with assistance from John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, and was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.   The litigation will be led by Mr. Bosch. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
