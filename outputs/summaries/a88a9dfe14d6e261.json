  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of two counts of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Chicago, Curtis Kitchen, who was a confidential informant for the Chicago Police Department, agreed to meet defendant and another man at a McDonald's restaurant in exchange for $660 in marked bills.  The complaint alleges that, on the day of trial, defendant informed the trial court that he wished to fire his appointed public defender and hire private counsel.  As alleged in the complaint, the court found that defendant had made no real effort to hire counsel, had neither raised the money to hire a lawyer, nor had he contacted a single attorney at the time of the stop.  In addition, the complaint alleged that defendant failed to provide an acceptable reason for desiring new counsel, including that he was surprised to learn the trial was going to start and that his appointed counsel had not worked on the case in the way he would like, (2) counsel would not file a motion to withdraw as well as a direct appeal, and (3) he had sent a letter to the public defender's office regarding complaints he had about his counsel's performance.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of seven years and a $1,000,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Justice's Office of Advocacy and Advocacy. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau."
