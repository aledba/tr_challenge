  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a drug dealer and his co-conspirator in a multi-year drug-trafficking conspiracy.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Richard W. Mishra, a recovering heroin dealer, and Mayank Mishra violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Mishra has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California today entered a judgment against Mishra that permanently restrains the jury from finding Mishra liable as a co-defendant in a drug conspiracy. The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar prohibiting Mishra from appearing before the court as an expert. The SEC also issued an order requiring Mishra to comply with a court order requiring him to show cause and effect in a criminal proceeding.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Mishra agreed to a six-month continuance of the trial to accommodate his need to provide testimony in a parallel criminal case, and agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 14, 2015, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Donnelly of the U. S. District Court in Manhattan entered a temporary injunction against Mishras, ordering him to surrender his passport, and imposing a $2,500 civil penalty against him. The jury deliberated for two hours before finding Mishras liable for a total of three felony counts.  Donnelly agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The final judgment orders Donnelly to disgorge $907,000 in illicit proceeds, pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million, and pay a bar of $28,000. The District Court also ordered Mishra not to participate in the investigation of the alleged drug ring and to be restrained from participating in the litigation. The order also requires that Mishra comply with the court order prohibiting him from appearing as an attorney or practicing before the SEC as an impartial judge. In addition, the order requires that he provide a reasonable explanation for why he was not able to provide a fair defense."
