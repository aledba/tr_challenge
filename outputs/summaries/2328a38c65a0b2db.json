  "summary": "On May 2, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty on three counts of rape in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that the defendant violated the sentencing package doctrine when he was sentenced to a prison term of five years.  According to the court's order, filed on June 15, 2015, the defendant was sentenced on two counts of felony rape, to be followed by a four-year mandatory sentence on the third count of the indictment, and a five-year prison term on the fourth count.  In its judgment, the court found that appellant violated the mandatory sentencing package, which requires defendants to serve at least five years of prison before they are eligible to apply for re-entry into the criminal justice system.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the Defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The judgment also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any security deposit or other security deposit in the name of the company or entity with which he solicited investment in the security deposit.  On July 17, 2018, the Court granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to surrender his passport. The court granted the request for an asset freeze and issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Roush and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The Court appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
