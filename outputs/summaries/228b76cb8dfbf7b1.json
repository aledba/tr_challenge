  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Miami-Dade County, Florida Police Officer Luis Perez for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, Florida, alleges that, on May 28, 2012, Officer Perez stopped Gregory, who was walking down the street, and shot him nine times. According to the complaint, Gregory had with him a metallic bat, an IPod with headphones, a cellphone, and a white trash bag. The complaint further alleges that Officer Perez used excessive force on Gregory in the course of conducting a routine patrol on the same side of the street. The SEC alleges that Gregory did not move his hands when Officer Perez shot him, and that Gregory continued to roll from side to side after Officer Perez fired at him. Gregory died on January 16, 2016, after being shot nine times in the leg.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against Gregory.  On May 31, 2015, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Officer Perez, charging him with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charging Officer Perez with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) and (c) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Perez has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17.
