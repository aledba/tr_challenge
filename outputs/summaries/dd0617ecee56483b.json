  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment against Owen Benson, Jr., a former resident of Des Moines, Iowa, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on March 6, 2016, Benson was watching three of his fianc\u00e9\u2019s children on the porch when he hit them with a broom handle. The complaint alleges that Benson used the broom handle because the children had previously \"laughed and said that didn't hurt\" when he spanked them with an open hand, and that he intended to cause pain or injury to the injured tissue on the back of his right leg.  The complaint further alleges that the jury instructions were confusing and misleading because they did not adequately describe the form of intent required for an assault causing bodily injury and child endangerment.  Benson also alleges that he did not spank the children because he was not having custody or control over a child and did not want to result in physical contact.  In addition, the complaint alleges the jury instruction on specific intent was inconsistent with the evidence presented to the court.  As a result, the court granted Benson's motion for a new trial without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  On May 9, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the Federal District Court in Des Moines granted Benson a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Sansone agreed to settle the case without admitting to the charges.  Without admitting or denied the allegations, Sansone consented to the entry of a final judgement that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to return to the United States and pay a $5,000 civil penalty, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael Jung, Ruth Stewart, and Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Graham Loomis and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Iowa Department of Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Iowa State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
