  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania yesterday entered a final judgment against Johnnie X. Stroud, a Pennsylvania parole violator who was previously sentenced to a prison term of 41/212 to 15 years.  According to the court's order, Stroud consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 6138(a)(5) of the Parole Code and orders him to serve the remainder of his original sentence.  The court also ordered Stroud to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole issued a no-merit letter to Stroud on February 23, 2012, stating that the Board had the ability to obtain him from federal custody to serve his state sentence, without credit for any periods of time he was incarcerated while on parole.

This order also prohibits Stroud from associating with any person who has been convicted of a prior felony with the Board in order to determine whether or not to grant him a reparative or a new sentence of incarceration.  For further information, see Commonwealth v. Pa. Bd. of Probate & Parole, 518 Pa. 491, 544 A.2d 568 (1980).  The Court also granted the parole board's request for a temporary restraining order against Stroud and issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the board as an attorney.  It also ordered the Board to consider the merits of the case before it issued its order suspending Stroud.  Finally, the Court granted the board's motion for a preliminary injunction against"
