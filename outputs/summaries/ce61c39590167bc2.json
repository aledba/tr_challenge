  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia today entered a final judgment against the parents of five children who were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder.  The court also issued a temporary restraining order and an order suspending the parents\u2019 parental rights.  According to the court\u2019s order, filed on February 9, 2018, the parents were told that their children had been receiving services for many years but there was never any lasting improvement.  In addition, the court found that the parents had failed to adequately care for their children, and that the children were experiencing the same truancy, lice, and behavioral problems while living with the paternal grandmother since removal from the home.  As alleged in the court order, the mother and father did not have the capacity to adequately deal with the children and instead left the children in the care of their paternal grandmother, who was not qualified to provide home school education.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, the father and mother consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains their parental rights to the three children.  On March 28, 2018 the court granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the parents to comply with the order by consenting to the issuance of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal anti-fraud provisions, including Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Additionally, the Court granted the parents the right to return the children to their homes and to participate in a post-adjudicatory improvement period.
