  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced charges against a Santa Cruz County man accused of making criminal threats and exhibiting a deadly weapon.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Santa Cruz, California, Christopher J. Weaver was arrested on June 6, 2016, and sentenced to four years and eight months in prison.  The complaint alleges that, while on the run, Weaver raised the specter of a possible return of his criminal conviction and a possible release from prison, and claimed that he had suffered a prior serious felony conviction for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Weaver had suffered one prior felony conviction and had a prior conviction for a similar conduct.  As alleged in the complaint, Weaver had been convicted and sentenced before the federal district attorney's office issued an order requiring him to participate in a pretrial diversion program for a specified class of persons.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Weaver agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of four years, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  He also agreed to be permanently enjoined from associating with any person who has been convicted or sentenced prior to the date at which he was sentenced, from participating in any pretrial program, from engaging in any criminal activity, from committing a felony, to participating in a supervised release program, to serving a five-year prison sentence.  On June 13, 2017, the court found Weaver incompetent to stand trial based on a recommendation from a public defender, and ordered that he be relieved of his duties as an attorney and appointed a second expert to evaluate Weaver's potential benefit.   The court also ordered that Weaver be censured from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a public figure in a case involving a defendant with a history of mental illness, and that he should be restrained from appearing, practicing, or appearing before the Commission on the Status of the Criminal Justice System.  Finally, on June 16, Weaver pleaded guilty to one count of making a false and misleading statement to a jury in a criminal case and was sentenced to prison terms of five years and six months.  After a hearing on June 17, Weaver consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the federal criminal laws, ordering him to comply with the court's order, and ordering that he pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038,"
