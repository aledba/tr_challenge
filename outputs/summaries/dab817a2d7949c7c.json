  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois on May 17, 2019, entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of multiple counts of other-crimes.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on May 29, 2012, defendant Robert Ward, a security guard at the Loyola Medical Center, was arrested and charged with two counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault.  According to the complaint, defendants told the officers that he was going to rape a woman, J.G., who was screaming from the van. The complaint further alleges that defendants told them that the woman was a prostitute who had been raped and that she had been forced to snort cocaine. The SEC alleges that the defendants' statements to the officers were false and misleading, and the court improperly allowed the defendants to cross-examine the witnesses and determine whether they were competent to present a defense.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Atwater.  On May 31, 2019 the court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendant to pay a civil penalty of 46 years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,038,767, and a $100,000 civil penalty. The judgment also prohibits defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a law enforcement agency, including the FBI's Chicago Field Office. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (January 24, 2019).  The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy S. Cotter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, the Illinois State Attorney General's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI Criminal Investigation Division, the Department of Justice's Criminal Justice Division and the Illinois Department of Banking and Securities and Exchange Commission."
