  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Endeavor Energy Resources, L.P., Big Dog Drilling, and Rig Movers Express, a Texas-based oil-and-gas contractor that went belly up, for failing to pay invoiced obligations not fully paid in the contractor\u2019s bankruptcy.  The court entered the final judgment on the merits of the case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Winkler County, Texas on December 23, 2008, the defendants claimed that Heritage Consolidated Services and its owner, George G. Staley, had agreed to a settlement in which they would jointly and severally recover $1.178 million owed to the contractor and $1,178,294.71 in liens against Staley.  As alleged in the complaint, Staley was not personally liable for the debts, but rather owed his proportionate share of the value of the well and owed the subcontractors a percentage of the owed amount.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Staley agreed to be held liable by the court for the amount owed to him on the invoices and for the interest owed on the liens.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's judgment, the parties consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and requiring them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $300,000.  Finally, the court granted the parties' request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants' assets, and ordering them to return to the states to settle the litigation.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Fort Worth Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and\u00c2\u00a0find\u00c2\u00c2\u00a0proof of\u00c2\u00a0operational performance."
