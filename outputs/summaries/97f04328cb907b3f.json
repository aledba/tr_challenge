  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Walter J. Nickels, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for second-degree assault and armed criminal action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, on January 30, 2017, the trial court improperly granted a motion for a new trial based on the defendant\u2019s failure to timely raise the issue of whether a jury could find him guilty of a felony charge.  According to the complaint, the jury deliberated for less than ten minutes before finding Nickesls guilty of the felony charge and finding him not guilty of any other charges.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the jury improperly deliberated on whether to grant the motion for new trial and whether to issue an order requiring a hearing on the merits of the case.  On November 5, 2018, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Nickeles consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  To learn more about trial court orders, see Litigation Release No. 539 (Jan. 26, 2020).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant.  A parallel action was instituted in federal court in Manhattan on February 12, 2020.  This action is subject to court approval.  An SEC complaint filed in the United States District Court in Manhattan today charges Nickesles with violating Section 575.150 and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the return of a jury-ordered injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, as well as civil penalties.  For further information, see SEC v. Kelly L. Gibson, et al., No. 17-cv-01221, (Dec. 10, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Amy C. Welshhans, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment."
