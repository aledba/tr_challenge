  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today announced that it has entered a final judgment against Robert Murphy, the former owner of Dentsply Int'l, Inc., that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-3 thereunder.  The court also granted Murphy's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other relief.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Boston, Murphy filed an adversary complaint in 2004 alleging that the Bankruptcy Court improperly dismissed Marinari's Chapter 13 proceeding without admitting or denying his allegations of bad faith and for breaching a contract to restore his vintage automobile.  In its judgment, the court found that Murphy had a right to a voluntary dismissal under Section 1307 of the federal securities laws, and that, as a result of his bad faith, he had an absolute right to dismissal under \u00a7 1307.  Murphy also had the opportunity to request an evidentiary hearing on his behalf, which he did not receive.  As set forth in the judgment, Murphy forfeited both his right to seek an injunction and an opportunity to petition the court for a hearing on the merits of the case, and he had the chance to file a second motion to reconsider before the court entered a default judgment against him.   The Court's order against Murphy, which was entered in a parallel administrative proceeding, also prohibits Murphy from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a judgment or order imposing a civil injunctive relief order.  On May 9, 2019, the Court granted Murphy an emergency asset freeze and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Without admitting to the SEC's findings, Murphy consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently restrains the Court's judgments against him, and orders Murphy to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,500,000 plus interest in a related civil proceeding, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000 in the amounts of a penny stock, respectively.  It also ordered Murphy to file an application to convert his Chapter 13 case to a Chapter 7 proceeding, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by"
