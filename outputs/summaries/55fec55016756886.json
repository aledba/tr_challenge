  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against California Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, finding that the state violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that Schneiderman violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose to the SEC that he had received numerous threatening phone calls, emails and emails from a member of a charitable foundation, and that he and his wife had been targeted by a group of anti-fraud activists who were trying to raise money from the charitable foundation.  According to the complaint, Schneiderman failed to show that the Schedule B disclosure requirement was sufficient to prevent potential violations of the federal laws.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Attorney General has failed to disclose that he has received numerous calls from members of his own charitable foundation who were threatened with reprisals.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the federal law, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their salaries and perquisites, and ordering Schneiderman to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the court has issued an order suspending Schneiderman from appearing before the SEC as an attorney general and ordering him to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  On February 13, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Schneiderman and the other defendants, charging him with violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  Among other things, the Court found for Schneiderman that the defendants violated the First Amendment when they failed to comply with the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and a cease-and-desist order.  Schneiderman has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the appointment of a receiver to oversee the IRS\u2019 collection of Schedule B information.  He has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public charitable trust and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any Schedule B filing.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (January 24, 2020).  The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction, disgorgment of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interests, and a civil monetary penalty. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney General of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
