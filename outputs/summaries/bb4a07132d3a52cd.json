  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maine today entered a final judgment against Dwain A. Sykes, a former husband and father of three who was convicted of domestic violence in 2017.  The court found that Sykes violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by admitting in evidence a recording of an October 22, 2017 9-1-1 call during which Sykes repeatedly hit the victim in the face with a closed fist. The court also found that the victim's statements during the call were not true and were not subject to exclusion by the Confrontation Clause of the federal securities laws. In addition, the court found, without admitting or denying Sykes's allegations, that the recording was not inadmissible because the victim did not have the opportunity or capacity to reflect or fabricate the statements and that the officer questioned the victim for the second time.  Sykes also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Rule 803(2) and orders him to remain at the courthouse under police supervision to ensure his availability if called to testify. The final judgment also prohibits Sykes from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a security deposit. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Androscoggin County, New Jersey, charges Sykes with violating Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 15b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The complaint also seeks a conduct-based injunction, an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, and an officer and director bar against Sykes.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Syke. The case is being handled by Jennifer C. Metzger, Kelly L. Gibson, and Amy C. Welshhans of the SEC's New York office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Field and Murray, and the case was supervised by Scott A. Kasper."
