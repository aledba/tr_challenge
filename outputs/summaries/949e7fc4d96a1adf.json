  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former employee of Rouse's Enterprises, L.L.C., who was terminated from the company for making false statements to a workers' compensation judge.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Metairie, Louisiana, Leontine Moran was working as a cook in the deli department for Rouse's when she slipped and fell in a puddle of water that had leaked from a refrigerated display case. Ms. Moran reported the accident to her manager, Edward Drevar, and then returned to her work. The complaint alleges that after the alleged fall, Moran was told that she had a recent fall at work and complained of right shoulder pain radiating to her right shoulder and neck. After a hearing on March 13, 2018, the trial court found that Moran had violated the antifraud provisions of the federal workers compensation law and ordered her to forfeit all of her benefits. The court also found that, based on the defendant's statements, Moran had forfeited her right to compensation benefits.  The court's order against Drevar permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 23:1208, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Inspector General, and the Louisiana Department of Health and Human Services."
