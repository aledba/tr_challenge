  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington today entered a final judgment against the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and its former director, Joseph P. McCluskey, in a case that was investigated by the agency's Select Committee on Intelligence Study on the detention and interrogation program.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., alleges that the CIA operated a detention facility in Poland in the early 2000s and that Abu Zubaydah was subjected to various combinations of interrogation techniques including waterboarding and face-to-face questioning.  According to the complaint, the CIA provided non-privileged information about the detention facility to the Polish authorities, including the identities of Polish government officials involved in the facility's construction and operation.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in the first four years of his detention in Poland, Mitchell and Jessen were restricted from disclosing state secrets such as the names of Polish citizens involved with the facility, operational details about the facility and private persons residing in Poland who might implicate the CIA's intelligence gathering efforts.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1782 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  Finally, the court granted the defendants a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from further violating the federal securities laws, ordering them to provide depositions for the purpose of obtaining a court order requiring them to show cause and consent to the discovery of the alleged state secrets privilege.  On May 2, 2020, the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution recognizing the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of the information requested in this case, and ordering the issuance of an order requiring the discovery to be conducted by a neutral third party.  A hearing is scheduled for June 21, 2020.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1782.  Separately, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against McCloskey. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Polish Attorney General's Office, the FBI, and the Polish Ministry of Justice in this matter."
