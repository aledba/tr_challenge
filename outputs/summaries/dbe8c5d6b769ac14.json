  "summary": "On December 6, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Carmel Valley Construction, Inc., a construction company, that permanently enjoins the company from violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on May 2, 2008, a construction laborer was injured while operating a compactor on a slope. The complaint alleges that the compactor hit a rock while he was working on the slope, causing Guzman to fall backwards, and then fell on top of him.  According to the complaint, Guzman had been employed as a laborer for approximately 12 years before he was injured on the job, and he had been performing construction work above ground level for approximately six months before the accident.  Guzman's injuries were not unusual, unusual, or unexpected.  As the complaint alleges, the event causing his injury was not a routine or routine event, and was not the result of a \"sudden and extraordinary employment condition.\"  The complaint further alleges that Guzman failed to meet his burden of proving that his psychiatric injury was caused by a sudden and extraordinary event.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Guzman.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New Jersey Office of Inspector General in this matter."
