  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment in favor of InContact Inc., formerly known as UCN Inc., that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay $19.7 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that, from February 2006 through April 2007, the College of Science and Technology (CSC) was unable to receive inbound calls, which in turn led to reduced student enrollment and therefore lost profits.  According to the complaint, Tatos used unverified and summary data provided by the College to create his model, which he then used to calculate the College\u2019s lost profits and to calculate his damages estimate.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, inContact consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Rule 702, ordering it to disgorge its alleged ill-gotten gains, and ordering the college to pay a civil penalty of $19,724.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Utah today announced criminal charges against Tatos, Hoffman, and another CSC expert for their roles in the alleged misconduct. The SEC also charged Tatos and Hoffman with aiding and abetting violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 and Rule 15a-3 thereunder.  Tatos agreed to settle the SEC's charges by agreeing to be permanently enjoined from violating Rule 15e-1, and Hoffman agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public university for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about how to spot an error in a statistical analysis, see Investor.gov/Investor.gov."
