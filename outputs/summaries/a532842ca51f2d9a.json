  "summary": "On August 31, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the injured officer in the case of Michele Bennett, who was injured in the line of duty while performing duty as a deputy sheriff. The court found that, as a result of her injury, Bennett received a schedule loss of use award which represented, in part, permanent residual damage to her right shoulder and arm. According to the court's order, Bennett was not entitled to additional reimbursement of her GML \u00a7'207-c benefits, but instead received a \"double recovery\" of $104,000, which is equivalent to a double recovery of her salary. The Court also found that the amount of the double recovery that Bennett received was not supported by the relevant statutes, and that the County could not afford to pay the additional salary. In a parallel action, on September 24, 2017, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the County from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the County to pay a civil penalty of $41,311.12, plus a $4,900 fee for an attorney.  The court also ordered the County of Cortland to comply with the Court's order.  In its order, the court entered a temporary restraining order against Bennett and ordered her to return to work in a light duty capacity with full pay. The order also prohibits Bennett from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges the County with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of a federal securities law, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The complaint also seeks an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against Bennett. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, John Rymas, and Eric R. Werner of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Werner. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State Attorney General's Office, and the Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
