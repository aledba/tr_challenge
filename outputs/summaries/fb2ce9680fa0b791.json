  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Atlanta, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to adequately disclose to the court that they received payments from ML Healthcare to treat injured, uninsured patients with viable tort claims who lacked medical insurance.  In addition, the complaint alleges that ML Healthcare failed to disclose to its treating doctors that a portion of their medical bills had been paid by ML Healthcare.  As alleged, ML Healthcare's payment arrangement was so inconsistent with the collateral source rule that it could not be admitted for the purpose of showing bias on the part of the jury.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  ML Healthcare has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a settlement that is subject to court approval.  It has also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, which will be determined by the court upon motion by the jury upon motion of the parties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Atlanta Regional Office by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Atlanta Office of Insurance Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Georgia Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
