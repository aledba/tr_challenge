  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New Hampshire today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with making and distributing child pornography.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Timothy Barr violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Act Section 13(b)(2) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Barr violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"). The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against Barr. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern Districts of New York today announced criminal charges against Barr arising from the same conduct alleged in Ferber's complaint. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Barr, charging him with violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 12b-20, and Rule 15a-1, and aiding and abetting the SEC's violations of Rule 16a-20. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Hampshire Department of Justice, and the FBI."
