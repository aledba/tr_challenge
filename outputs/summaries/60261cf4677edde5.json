  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Massachusetts today entered final judgments against Sylvania Electric Products, Inc., a Massachusetts-based real estate development company, and its former owner in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Andover, Massachusetts, alleges that, in May, 2014, the city of Newton issued an order requiring the company to amend its deed restriction to permit a residential use on a parcel of land owned by the city.  According to the complaint, the company sought to amend the deed restriction so that it could construct a second access road over the property, but the city refused to grant the company the right to do so.   The complaint further alleges that the company failed to comply with the city's request for an exemption from the restrictive covenant, and failed to provide a sufficient basis for its application for a comprehensive permit under G.L.c. 40B, \u00a7 20(a) and (c) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Scott A. Thompson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Division for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office."
