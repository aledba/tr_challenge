  "summary": "On December 5, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the CFPB, finding that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that, under the direction of then-Director Richard M. D. Mulvaney, the agency issued an order requiring banks to report material non-material errors in their HMDA reporting. The order also required that banks report any errors in the HMDA data to the agency. The complaint also alleges that the order requires that banks make certain disclosures to members seeking home mortgages; make a reasonable, good faith determination of a borrower's ability to repay a mortgage; and that, in the event that a bank does not comply with the proposed rule, it will have to incur costs to comply with those obligations.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against D.C. resident Leandra English for her role in the alleged scheme.  According to the complaint, English consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, English agreed to a permanent injunction, which prohibits her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any financial products or services subject to court approval. The settlement is subject to Court approval.  On January 1, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a temporary restraining order, an injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against her from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The SEC previously issued a similar order against the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which also issued a preliminary injunction against the agency's enforcement of the 2015 HMDA rule. The court's order against English was entered by the SEC on December 21, 2017 and unsealed on January 24, 2018. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Department of Justice, and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in this matter."
