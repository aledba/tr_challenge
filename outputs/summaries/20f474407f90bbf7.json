  "summary": "The Equal Protection Clause entitles owners of similarly situated property to roughly equal tax treatment. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois yesterday entered a final judgment against the tax assessor for Cook County, Illinois, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 23-15 of the Tax Injunction Act of 1940.  The court also found that the Illinois statute does not permit taxpayers to raise their federal constitutional claims in state court.  According to the complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, the taxpayers allege that the Assessor violated that guarantee by assessing their properties at rates significantly lower than the de facto rates that most other property owners enjoyed.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office today announced criminal charges against the taxpayers for their alleged violations of the federal securities laws.  To settle the charges, the IRS has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the taxpayers from future violations of this provision and orders them to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the taxpayers\u2019 complaint, the court also ordered the IRS to comply with the court\u2019s order, which is subject to court approval.  On May 9, 2018, the U. S. Attorney for the Central District of New York filed a civil injunctive action against the IRS, charging the taxpayers with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  A hearing is scheduled for June 21, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 598 (1989).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
