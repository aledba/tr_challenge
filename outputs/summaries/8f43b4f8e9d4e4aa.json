  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against a Kentucky man who was convicted of a felony for the May 17, 2016, shooting that left Gerrado Thomas paralyzed below the waist.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Louisville, Kentucky, Michael D. Torrence and his wife, Tatiana Turner, were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC alleges that Torrence, despite having a history of felony convictions, was never called as an expert witness in the criminal case.  As alleged in the complaint, Torrence also was not called as a lay witness because he did not have the requisite background to corroborate his story.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Torrence.  Torrence has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and orders a temporary restraining order against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged conduct of the defendant.  On May 26, 2018, the court granted the SEC\u2019s motion for a new trial and a motion for summary judgment against Turner, finding that the jury had sufficient evidence to determine whether Torrence was a reasonable person to participate in the conduct of a criminal trial.  Turner agreed to a settlement that would require her to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and appoint a receiver of her own.  A hearing on June 5, 2019, was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. for the SEC to consider the merits of the case against Turner.
