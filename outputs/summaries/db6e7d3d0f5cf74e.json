  "summary": "On April 13, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky entered a final judgment against Erin Baas, a business banker who sought divorce from her husband, Edward Baas.  The court found that Erin violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, Erin failed to comply with the agreed-upon valuation of a non-voting interest in American Facade Restoration, LLC (AFR), a real estate holding company whose sole asset is the warehouse it leases to AFR, when she accepted Edward\u2019s offer to claim their three-year-old daughter on her behalf.  As alleged in the court order, the mediation agreement was not procedurally unconscionable because neither the mediator nor her attorney were liable for any violations of the charged provisions.  In addition, the court ruled that Erin could not consent to the mediation because she was under no constraint to continue the mediation if she felt uncomfortable continuing.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Erin consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the anti-fraud, undue influence, overreaching, and attorney misconduct provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of $1,137,000 plus prejudgment interest of $32,351.28 in the amount of a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The court also ordered Erin to sign a cease-and-desist order, which prohibits her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to a jury trial, and to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $75,000, respectively.  Erin also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to the appointment of an accountant or actuary as a mediator.  To settle the case, Erin agreed to a settlement where she would receive a percentage of the amount owed to her by her employer.  She also agreed not to rely upon any legal advice as to whether she should accept or reject any valuation of the interest in AFR.  Additionally, she agreed to participate in the mediation by signing a \"formal separation agreement\" that included a provision requiring her to show cause and effect when she signed the document.  This settlement is not subject to any court approval, and the parties agreed to the issuance of a cease and desist order that requires each of them to sign the final judgment before the court can issue a judgment.
