  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against the federal government against the Mechoopda Tribe for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the Tribe, ordering the Tribe to comply with the Commission's order to take the parcel into trust under the restored-lands exception.  According to the court's order, the Tribe sought an extension of time to respond to a 2006 report by a history professor who concluded that, although the tribe had historical connections to the Chico parcel, the modern Tribe was not biologically descended from the pre-1850 tribe.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the tribe consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Secretary of the Interior from violating the federal securities laws, and orders the tribe to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against the tribe, and the District Court entered a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal law.  On May 20, 2008, the Honorable Rebecca M. Welshhans granted the Tribe's motion for summary judgment, ordering an asset freeze and other emergency relief, and appointing a receiver to oversee the transfer of the tribe's assets.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 21, 2008.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (Dec. 20, 2016).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Public Finance Abuse Unit.
