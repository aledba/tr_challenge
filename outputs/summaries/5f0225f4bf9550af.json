  "summary": "On December 20, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama entered a final judgment against defendants in a civil action brought by the National Association of Realtors against Richard N. Bell.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Mobile, Alabama, alleges that Bell violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  According to the complaint, Bell was notified of the unauthorized use of his photograph on a website by Sandy Frost and Roberts Brothers, Inc. (RB) on July 29, 2019.  Frost refused to remove the photograph from the website.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Bell for his role in the alleged scheme.  On December 14, 2017, the court granted Bell's motion for summary judgment against Frost, ordering him to pay $20,882.80 in fees and $250.30 in costs, and ordering Bell to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Bell consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, imposes a $25,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Bell also agreed to be barred from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, with assistance from the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force. The litigation will be led by Norman Blum, Henry L. (\u201cMax\u201d) Cassidy, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Department of Insurance, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Alabama Office of Professional Regulation."
