  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New York City landlord who claimed that he was entitled to attorneys' fees for re-renting an apartment after prevailing in a holdover proceeding.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan in 2004, Kyle Taylor and his landlord, Graham Court Owner's Corp., entered into a rental lease for $2,200 a month for an unregulated apartment in Manhattan.  As alleged in the complaint, the lease had become deregulated because $60,000 in renovations were performed to the apartment before the tenant took occupancy.  The complaint alleges that, in response, the tenant submitted proof that he had performed renovation work at the apartment.  In response, a landlord's officer, who was not permitted to do the work, came and verified the electrical work had been performed.  Finally, the court found that the landlord had not breached the lease by making the alterations, and that the tenant is entitled to recover his fees as part of his compensation.   The SEC's order, which was entered on or about July 26, 2011, permanently enjoins the landlord from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the landlord to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $3,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the landlord has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, and requiring him to provide a copy of the judgment to the court.  Additionally, the Court has issued an order suspending the landlord's right to return the apartment to the tenant, ordering the tenant to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, and imposing a $50,000 officer-and-director bar against the landlord.  On August 2, 2011 the court granted the landlord a temporary restraining order and ordered him to comply with the court's order barring him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any apartment in the United States, including one in Manhattan that had been deemed \"desirable\" by the court, and ordering the landlord not to violate the rental lease provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 15(a).  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Taylor arising out of the same conduct alleged by the tenant. "
