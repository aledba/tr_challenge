  "summary": "On June 9, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against Boston Heart Diagnostics Corp., a medical device company, for defrauding Medicare and other healthcare providers.  The court found that Boston Heart violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and that it was not required to independently determine the medical necessity of tests ordered by physicians.  According to the court's order, Boston Heart submitted false claims by engaging in a scheme that encouraged non-cardiology physicians to order medically unnecessary tests, and then billing the government for those tests.  Boston Heart's complaint, filed in federal district court in Denver, Colorado, charges Boston Heart with violations of the federal and state securities laws, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado today announced criminal charges against the company.  On June 23, 2017 the court granted the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, and ordered Boston Heart to submit a second amended complaint in which it agreed to settle the matter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s amended complaint, the court also issued an order suspending the defendants from violating the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for July 26, 2017.  To learn more about the False Claims Act, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-1.  For further information on the subject matter of this matter, see Rule 17d-8-1, litigated in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.    The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Groat. \u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Office of Inspector General, and the Colorado Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
