  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of Marshana Philpot-Willis, a Chicago resident who died while in the care of One Hope United, Inc. (One Hope).  According to the court's order, filed on January 6, 2015, Marshana's father, Martell Willis, Jr., and his sister, Lamariana Philpot, were the parents of two daughters who were born 10 months apart.  The court found that Willis violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court improperly granted Willis's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay $750,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In its order, the court also denied Willis's motion to disqualify the public guardian from representing the estate at a dependency hearing, finding that he had a duty of impartiality to each of the estates, and ordering him to allocate a share of the settlement to himself, 10%, and 0.5% to the estate's mother, who was also a public guardian at the time.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the order, Willis consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and imposes a $75,000 civil penalty against him.  On January 8, 2017, the Honorable Amy C. McKinley of the Chicago Regional Office issued an order suspending Willis from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.   The order also prohibits Willis from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the sale of a security deposit, and prohibits him from participating as an unregistered broker or dealer in any securities offering or offering of any security deposit in the securities of any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, or nationally recognized statistical statistical rating organization.  It also prohibits the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter or an order appointing a receiver to represent the estate in a dependent hearing.  Finally, the order requires the court to determine whether a person is entitled to a penny-per-share of a penny that is paid to the receiver of a deceased estate.  This order also requires the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment that is subject to court approval.  For example, on November 10, 2016, a federal district court in Chicago granted Willis the right to reapply after five years of serving"
