  "summary": "On January 10, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama entered a final judgment against Bryan Patrick Hopson, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 17 years in prison for second-degree assault, a felony, and a 10-year felony for attempting to elude a law enforcement officer.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Mobile, Ala., Hopson was charged with two counts of reckless endangerment and reckless driving.  The SEC alleges that Hopson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13A-11-61 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  Hopson consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his prior felony conviction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Hopson.  As alleged in the complaint, Hopson also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint,Hopson agreed to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar, and to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, plus prejudgment interest of $2,065, in a civil penalty of $100,000.  On January 11, 2018, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals issued an order suspending Hopson from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to comply with the court's order suspending him from appearing, practicing, or participating in any SEC-related proceeding.  To learn more about double jeopardy, see Criminal Procedure Bulletin No. 13-20-17 (January 10, 2010).  In its order imposing the suspension order, the court also ordered Hopson to surrender his passport and pay a $75,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  Additionally, the Court issued a temporary restraining order, which prohibits defendants from making or selling any offer to sell or offer a security deposit in the name of another person or entity, and requires that the officer and the person selling the security deposit to be registered with the SEC.  Finally, the order requires the officer to provide a copy of the complaint to the court.  For further information, see Civil Procedure Bulletin no. 13"
