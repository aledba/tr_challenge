  "summary": "On September 12, 2017, the Ohio Department of Public Safety, Division of Police, announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting the termination of a Columbus Police Officer who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17.9 of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Ohio, alleges that, from July 2002 to June 2014, James Hassey, a Columbus, Ohio, police officer, engaged in various misconduct, including regularly smoking marijuana. According to the complaint, Hassey agreed to settle the SEC's charges against him by agreeing to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of up to 24 hours. The settlement is subject to court approval. The complaint also alleges that Hassey waived his right to a hearing to determine whether the appropriate level of discipline for Hassey should be imposed.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hassey.  On September 26, 2014, the Columbus Police Department filed a complaint in federal district court in Columbus, alleging that, in light of the misconduct alleged by Hassey's ex-girlfriend, an officer who had been suspended for using marijuana for the previous three to five years, was not entitled to the same level of disciplinary relief as Hassey because he had not tested positive for marijuana. The SEC also charged Hassey with violating Rules 1.36 and 1.42(C) of the Columbus City Charter, which requires a court to determine the severity of an officer's disciplinary action, including whether to impose a 24-hour suspension. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint to the court, the officer consented to entry of an order permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the city's securities laws, ordering him to comply with the court's order, and appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver. The receiver also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public safety agency. The Commission's order also prohibits Hassey from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including in the event of an emergency. The court will determine how to proceed with the receiver's investigation. The case is being handled by the Ohio Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Division of Criminal Investigation. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the Internal Affairs Bureau, and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission."
