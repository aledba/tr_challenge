  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a landlord who failed to acquire and maintain an automated external defibrillator (AED) on the premises of a boxing gym.  The court's order, which was entered on July 11, 2018, finds that the landlord had no duty to acquire or maintain an AED on its premises.  According to the order, however, the court found that Lupo had a duty to provide and maintain the AED at the gym when it was not required by state law to do so.  As alleged in the complaint, Lupo did not have a duty as a landlord to obtain and maintain a AED when operating a gym, because it did not require Wild Card to provide it.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Lupo to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Lupo.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Rymas and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Financial Services Authority, the British Columbia Securities Commission, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
