  "summary": "On January 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Reliable Reports of Texas, Inc., a Texas-based company that provides residential and commercial property inspection services for insurance companies.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of Reliable, and ordering Reliable to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ohio, Reliable falsely claimed that it was common for its inspectors to work more than 50 hours per week absent overtime pay, and that Reliable would pay inspectors the piece-work rate for hours worked in a week over 40, and not the overtime premium.  Reliable's complaint alleges that, in reality, the day-to-day duties of an Inspector involved traveling to the property in question to conduct an inspection, completing a report, completing the report, and forwarding the report to his/her manager where it is reviewed for accuracy and completeness.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s amended complaint, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Reliable from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Reliable and its field team to comply with the court's order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges.   The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint, filed on January 13, 2017, charges Reliable with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-director and penny stock bars against all of the defendants, as well as a penny stock bar against Maclin and Reliable. The SEC also seeks a court-ordered injunction, an injunction, and an officer and director bar against all defendants from participating in or participating in any future collective actions.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 567 (Dec. 15, 2017).  The Complaint also names as a relief defendant a Texas company that is not subject to general jurisdiction under the federal securities laws."
