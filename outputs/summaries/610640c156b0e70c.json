  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in a reinsurance case against Factory Mutual Insurance Co. Ltd. (\"FICI\"), a company that issued a property insurance policy to Bull Data Systems Inc. (\"Bull Data\").  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, the Commission found that, in a facultative reinsurance contract, reinsurers are obligated to pay a per occurrence liability cap equal to the amount of their total exposure to third-party defense costs, regardless of whether the underlying policy is understood to cover expenses such as, for instance, defense costs.  The Complaint further alleged that, under Excess, the reinsurers' aggregate liability for both settlement costs and loss adjustment expenses was capped at $7 million.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the Complaint alleges that the Commission violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The Commission's Final Judgment, which was entered yesterday, permanently enjoins the Commission from future violations of Sections 206 of the Exchange Act and Rules 206-8, 206-9, and 206-10, and orders the Commission to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced parallel criminal charges against the Commission.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge William J. Donnelly of the Second Circuit entered a judgment ordering the Commission against the defendants in the case.  Donnelly agreed to a judgment that imposes a $1 million civil penalty and a $250,000 officer and director bar, with the Commission agreeing to a $2.5 million officer-and-director bar, and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty. The Commission also agreed to the entry of a judgment against the defendant in the Commission case, ordering a preliminary injunction, imposing a $75,000 penalty, and ordering a conduct-based injunction. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Barry. The Division of Insurance and Securities and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0securities.\u00c2\u00a0"
