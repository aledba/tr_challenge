  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against a Kansas man who was sentenced to prison for a prior felony.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that Christopher Obregon violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws when he pleaded no contest to two felony counts of marijuana possession with intent to distribute and a prior conviction for a similar Kansas person crime.  According to the complaint, Obregon pleaded guilty in May 2016 to a felony burglary of a dwelling that was calculated using a \"persistent drug offender\" enhancement, which in turn was based on the trial court's finding that a prior criminal conviction was \"sexually motivated.\"  The complaint also alleges that Obregon consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of six months' imprisonment and a $75,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay an $82,500 civil penalty in the amount of $7,500.  Obregon also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Obregon.  On March 9, 2018, the Court of Appeals for the Northern District of Missouri issued a temporary restraining order halting the issuance of the restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering Obregon to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amounts of $2,500, $1,000, and $100,000 in civil penalties.  It also issued an order suspending the issuance and purchase of any security or other security that may be required of a defendant.  Among other things, the court issued a preliminary injunction halting Obregon from further participating in any future issuance of a security or any other security or security order.   The court's order also temporarily suspended the issuing of a civil injunctive relief order, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Welshhans and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kansas Department of Criminal Justice."
