  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of second-degree premeditated murder in 2003.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Michigan, alleges that Mark E. \"Mark\" Unger, a thirty-six-year veteran attorney who specialized in medical malpractice and product liability cases, provided expert testimony to support his client\u2019s claims that a key prosecution expert had been ineffective in his handling of the case.  According to the complaint, the defendant told the defense counsel that he had \"re-victimized\" Florence Unger after she fell from the boathouse deck and that he wanted to have her body cremated in order to \"lose sight of the fact that a human life was senselessly snuffed out.\"  In addition, the complaint alleges that the prosecution failed to show that Dr. Paul McKeever had any reasonable basis to believe that the victim had died of a \"drowning in his own blood\" event.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Unger consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Unger.  On November 6, 2009, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered Unger to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of the matter.  To learn more about this matter, see Litigation Release Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 26, 2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations, and Joseph G. Sansone, Director of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit.
