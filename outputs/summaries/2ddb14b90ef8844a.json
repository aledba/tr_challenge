  "summary": "On February 25, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Texas entered a final judgment against Karen Grenrood, a forensic psychiatrist, and her husband, Brett Nathaniel Silverman, in a case that was investigated by the Texas Department of Public Health.  The court found that the handwritten document was not a will because it did not convey property, and that Silverman did not execute the will.  According to the court's order, however, the court held that a will is entitled to probate because it appoints an executor.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Silverman and Silverman's mother.  As alleged in the complaint, Silverman died intestate on May 4, 2017, and Goldman's brothers and sister-in-law, Brett and Irma Lee Silverman each have a one-half interest in Silverman&rsquo;s real and personal property.&nbsp; The court also ruled that Goldman andSilverman could not be appointed independent executors of the estate.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Goldman consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Goldman also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer and director of a public company.  Silverman also consented not to be named an independent executor under the federal securities laws.  On February 26, 2018, the SEC filed an amended complaint in the United States District Court against Goldman.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Office of Financial Regulation."
