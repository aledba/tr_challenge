  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against Four Zero One Associates LLC, a Michigan-based consulting firm, for failing to claim the Small Business Alternative Credit (SBAC) for the 2008 tax year.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Grand Rapids, Michigan, alleges that FourZero One violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to include a bonus in the calculation of compensation for a given tax year in the form of a \"tax year.\"  The complaint also alleges that, under the federal tax law, a bonus counts as compensation in the tax year that the bonus is paid, regardless of the taxpayer's method of accounting, and that, on a cash-based basis, any compensation received by a shareholder or officer or director of a public company should be included as compensation.  In addition, the complaint alleges that four Zero One was not entitled to the SBAC because it did not comply with the statutory definition of compensation, which is ambiguous and should be set aside in order to avoid absurd results.  According to the complaint, the SEC's final judgment on the matter, which was entered on consent by the court, permanently enjoins Four Zero Two from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Four Zero has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal anti-fraud provisions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint filed in the federal court for the Southern District of New York, the court granted the SEC request for summary disposition of the complaint.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the United States District Court in New York entered a judgment that permanently restrains the Court's order and orders the court to determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be determined by the Court upon motion of the court. The court also ordered the SEC to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court on May 25, 2019. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Michigan Department of Revenue in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 26, 2019).  The Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website."
