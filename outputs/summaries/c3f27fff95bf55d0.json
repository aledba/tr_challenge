  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of Sebastopol and three other defendants in a PRA case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, on July 3, 2009, Julia Anna Bertoli was involved in a tragic accident when she was struck by a car as she walked inside a crosswalk located on Highway 116.  The complaint alleges that Bertoli's family retained Rouda to represent her interests in the litigation.  As alleged in the complaint, Bertoli had received numerous requests for documents related to her accident, including e-mails sent to and from city employees who had never been served with the PRA request.  Bertoli, as a result of his refusal to comply with the City's requests, was rendered permanently disabled and required to pay attorney fees and costs to the city.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the City agreed to the court's order, which permanently enjoins Bertoli from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Bertoli to pay $56,595.50 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his legal fees.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Bertoli.  On August 2, 2011, the court issued a temporary restraining order halting Bertoli and three others from filing PRA requests in the future.  A hearing for Bertoli is scheduled for September 24, 2011.  To determine whether to proceed with the litigation, the SEC requested a court-ordered injunction, an order appointing a receiver, and an officer and director of a public agency.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Tracy Press and supervised by Marc Blau of the San Francisco Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Press and Mr. Blau. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
