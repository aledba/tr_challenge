  "summary": "On January 1, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Cady Hill Solar, Inc., a Vermont-based solar energy company, for failing to timely respond to an agency's request for a certificate of public good (CPG).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Cady's application was incomplete because, in each case, the applicant had not received notice that the CPG application had been filed on the date the Commission found the application complete.  The complaint further alleges that, in addition to failing to respond to the Commission's requests for a CPG, the complaint also alleges that Cady had failed to provide sufficient information about the project to determine whether the application was complete and whether it was timely submitted.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action, charging Cady with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Cady from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders Cady to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any CPG. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Department of Commerce, the Connecticut Department of Insurance, the Vermont Department of Natural Resources, the Department of Justice, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Connecticut Office of the Secretary of State's Office."
