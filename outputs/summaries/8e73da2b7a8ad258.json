  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against Jason Anderson, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for two separate drug-dealing convictions.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis on September 21, 2000, Anderson was arrested on drug-related charges and later pleaded guilty to two felony counts of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance.  The complaint alleges that Anderson was initially charged with a felony for carrying a concealed handgun, but was later convicted and sentenced for a third felony.  In a parallel action, the court found that Anderson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay a penalty of 15 years and a $75,000 civil penalty.  Anderson agreed to the judgment and agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Anderson consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, imposes a five-year prison term, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David E. Elliott and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office.
