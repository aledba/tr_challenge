  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of three counts of first-degree sexual abuse.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon on May 27, 1985, a defendant was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in conduct that, if committed by an adult, would constitute a felony.  In addition, the complaint alleged that the defendant had engaged in a pattern of conduct that was consistent with the statutory provisions of the federal criminal code.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the defendants did not engage in any criminal conduct, and instead engaged in multiple acts of sexual abuse that resulted in a longer sentence than the one he would have received if he had committed the same conduct in a juvenile delinquency proceeding.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders him to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of restitution he will pay in the future.   The court also ordered the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil monetary penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Finally, the court granted the request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendant from associating with any third- or fourth-party party, and ordered the judge to appoint a receiver for each of the defendants.  For further information, see Oregon Department of Justice v. Nelson, 282 Or. App. 397-98, 385 P.3d 1173 (2016).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oregon State Attorney General's Office, and the Oregon Bureau of Criminal Investigation."
