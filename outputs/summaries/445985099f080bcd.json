  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a mortgage-securitization case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Montgomery, Alabama, alleges that, in connection with the creation of various residential mortgage-backed securities trusts, the defendants misrepresented to the public that they had a duty to record mortgage assignments.  According to the complaint, however, as part of their scheme to record the loans, the Defendants misrepresented that the loans were required by law to be recorded.  In fact, the complaint alleges, as alleged, that the defendants did not record any mortgage assignments at the time the trusts were created, nor did they pay the accompanying fees, which are preconditions for enjoying the enumerated benefits and are required by statute.  As a result of the defendants' misrepresentations, the SEC's final judgment permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David R. Ebbitt of the Atlanta Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit, and the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations' Risk Analysis Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Robert E. Dolan and supervised by Gregory A. Kasper."
