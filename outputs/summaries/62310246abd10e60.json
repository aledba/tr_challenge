  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered final judgments against a defendant in a litigated action brought by the California Office of Financial Regulation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Sanford J. Wishnev violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that, as a result of the 1934 amendment, Wishneov was not required to obtain a borrower\u2019s signed agreement in order to charge compound interest on a loan. Instead, the complaint alleges, he was required to sign and return a copy of the amended amendment, which he did not do. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney General for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against him. The SEC also announced that it was seeking an asset freeze and other emergency relief.  According to the complaint, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order and an order suspending the issuance, purchase, offer and sale of securities. The court also issued an order temporarily suspending Wishneev from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued a final judgment ordering the SEC to conduct an independent investigation into the alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of its Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"). The SEC is continuing its investigation. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Office of the Secretary of the Department of Banking and Securities and the California Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
