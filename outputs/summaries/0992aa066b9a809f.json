  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Philadelphia Police Officer Christopher Noga, Crain Perry, Ann Brown, Darnell Jessie, Kevin Palmer, Vincent Luu, and Eric McDowell in a parallel criminal case.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Appellant, who is charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Noga and the other defendants were playing dice on the corner of Salford and Market Streets when they heard gunshots. According to court documents filed in the case, Naeem Garfield was shot multiple times in the face and once in the neck during the course of the game, and he was subsequently pronounced dead at the scene. The SEC's order, which was entered on the same day as the court's judgment, requires that Appeel comply with the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The court's order also requires Appelant to provide a copy of the final judgment, which is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Appelants.  On May 2, 2017, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Mascianica entered a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $2,500.  Appelanduski agreed to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Police Department, the Pennsylvania Department of Criminal Justice, and the Philadelphia Field Office of the Attorney General's Office."
