  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against four Gwinnett County officers for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that on November 27, 2015, three officers entered Moore's home and arrested her for theft after she refused to comply with officers\u2019 repeated requests to remove her shoes from the house. The complaint alleges that the officers entered the home without a warrant and arrested Moore without her knowledge, without a reasonable basis of probable cause, without her consent. Moore then allegedly kicked and kicked one of the officers in the groin, and the officers used a taser to subdue her. The SEC alleges that Richey and another officer followed Moore\u2019s instructions to put her hands behind her back and submit to the arrest. The court also found that Moore did not have a warrant for her arrest and that she did not need to submit to an arrest. Moore also allegedly told the officers that she wanted merely to grab her shoes, and they did not execute the warrant. In addition, Moore allegedly told one officer that she had a gun in the nightstand by the door and told him not to \"grab her shoes.\" The court granted the officers qualified immunity on all of these counts.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Moore arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on June 10, 2016, Moore had a dispute with a different sublessee, Shannon Daley, during which she sought an arrest warrant on the basis of theft and obstructing an officer. The Complaint alleges that Moore confronted the officers at the scene of the arrest and demanded that they remove the taser from her possession. The officers refused, and Moore was arrested without incident. Moore has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Moore consented to a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty. Moore agreed to an officer-and-officer bar and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security"
