  "summary": "On February 25, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Jermaine O'Conner, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to serve a total of 240 months in prison.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Waco, Texas, on August 3, 2010, the Honorable Judge Terence T. Clevert of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order halting the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Clevert to impose a time-served sentence of 242 months.  The complaint alleges that, in compliance with the court's order, the defendant filed a First Step Act motion to reduce his sentence to 242 months, which was substantially higher than the mandatory minimum that the court imposed.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Texas today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On February 24, 2019 the U-S Attorney's office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania announced criminal prosecutions against O'Connell and Glore, who were convicted of felony drug possession and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 144 months to 240 months. The SEC's Complaint alleges that the defendant was not eligible for a reduction under the Fair Sentencing Act, because he had already served his mandatory minimum sentence of five years and a maximum penalty of twenty-five years, and that Judge Clevert had already imposed a second-tier mandatory minimum.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the court agreed to the defendant's motion to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordered him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar. The court also ordered the defendant to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of his ill-gotten gains with respect to his release from prison, and to pay civil penalties in the amounts of 240 and 240 months, respectively. The defendant also agreed to a five-year mandatory minimum and a three-year supervised release, which would have required him to serve at least 240 months of his sentence. The settlement is subject to approval by the court.  A hearing on February 26, 2019 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 206(1) of 2019."
