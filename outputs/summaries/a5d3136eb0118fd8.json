  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in a civil action brought by a Connecticut woman who was involved in a motor vehicle accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that Donna Krausman was injured in an automobile accident and served as an unregistered representative of a third party. The complaint alleges that the defendants were unable to agree as to the amount of damages to which the plaintiff is entitled under the underinsured motorist provisions of her automobile liability policy issued by the defendant. The SEC alleges that after exhausting the limits of Neilson's auto liability policy, the plaintiff, on January 12, 2017, served the defendant's wife and son with postjudgment interrogatories, who subsequently sought a protective order, to preclude a deposition. The court granted the defendants' motion to compel, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to respond to the interrogatories within thirty days of the court's denial of the plaintiff's motion for an order requiring her to comply with the subpoena provisions of the federal securities laws. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against the defendants. Among other things, the SEC charged the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) thereunder of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"). The SEC is seeking an injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In addition, the complaint charges the defendant with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and seeks an injunction against future violations of Section 52-351b of the Exchange Act and Rule 50b2-3 thereunder. The Court granted the parties' requests for an injunction and ordered the defendants to submit to an examination by an arbitrator pursuant to Rule 17a-1. The defendants agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of judgments that impose permanent injunctions against further violations of the securities laws, ordering the parties to pay civil penalties of $19,500 each, and ordering the court to determine whether or how to proceed with the litigation. The settlement is subject to court approval. The litigation is being led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office."
