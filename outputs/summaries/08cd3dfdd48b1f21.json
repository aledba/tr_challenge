  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against defendant Ronald Delester Burke, who was convicted of second degree rape in 2009.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Tacoma, Washington, alleges that, in July 2009, KEH arrived at Tacoma General Hospital and reported that she had been raped in the hospital.  According to the complaint, the assailant had covered her mouth and took her to the hospital for an emergency room exam.  KEH allegedly told the examiners that the exam was to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.  In addition, the complaint alleges that KEH described her attacker as a tall, light-skinned black man, with short hair and a t-shirt and no jacket, who had been drinking and had been kicked out of the hospital several hours earlier.   The complaint further alleges that the victim described her assailant as a \"tough muscle\" and that she did not want her attacker to do this to her.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Burke consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Burke also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order.  Finally, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against KEH, and ordered her to return to the institution where she was previously incarcerated for the purpose of recovering stolen property from her prior criminal conviction. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Seattle Police Department, and the Tacoma Police Department in this matter."
