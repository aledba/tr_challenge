  "summary": "The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California yesterday granted summary judgment in a second Chapter 11 case brought by a defendant in connection with the purchase of radio spectrum licenses from the Federal Communications Commission.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in 1998, Warren Havens and his business partner, Dr. Arnold Leong, filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  According to the complaint, the court found that Leong had standing to answer the petition and that he was entitled to attorney's fees and costs under \u00a7303(i).  The complaint also alleges that the court improperly granted Leong's request for a 60% reduction in attorneys' fees, costs, and travel time, despite the fact that the complaint was filed in bad faith.  Havens' complaint, filed in federal court in Alameda County, California, charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $562.60, $91,890, and $192,965, respectively.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Havens.  On September 22, 2016, the Court issued a summary judgment against Leong and ordered him to comply with the court's order that he comply with, in part, with the issuance of a judgment ordering him to pay $157,500 in fees and expenses under Section 303(i) and ordering Leong to respond to the Court's order by filing an Involuntary Judgment.  Leong agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that imposes permanent injunctions against future violations of the antiligence provisions of the federal securities laws, as well as to pay a civil penalty of $2,500.   The judgment also prohibits Havens from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the public company or by association with any person or entity that is not a party to the bankruptcy proceedings. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
