  "summary": "On June 19, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alaska entered a final judgment against the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (\"ANTHC\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Anchorage, alleges that ANTHC's supervisor, Zachary Malbalay, raised the issue of tribal sovereign immunity with one of his co-workers, telling her that she was in a unique position because she was more likely to have relatives come to the hospital because of her Native-Alaskan heritage.  According to the complaint, the supervisor then allegedly asked her to conduct a procedure that a Caucasian coworker was not required to conduct, and instead gave the assignment to Ms. Barron, who was also pregnant at the time.   The complaint further alleges that the supervisor told her that he was \"just uninformed about Alaskan Native culture\" and that he \"just wanted to kick her out of the hospital.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against both defendants.  In its order granting the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, the court entered an order freezing the assets of the defendants, imposing a civil injunctive relief, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Malbalaya consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval, and the court will determine whether to impose a permanent injunction, impose a civil monetary penalty, and issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the tribe's assets.  An SEC investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Enforcement Division's Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Basinger and Ms. Barasinger. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alaska Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice and the Alaska Secretary of State's Office of Economic and Risk Analysis."
