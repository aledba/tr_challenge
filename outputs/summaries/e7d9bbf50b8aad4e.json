  "summary": "On July 1, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference against them.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 13(c) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In its order, the court also ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000, $50,000 and $100,000.  According to the court's order, filed on June 12, 2019 in federal district court in the District of South Dakota, the Defendants violated Section 20-9-54(1) and 206-8-3 thereunder and Section 206(3)-8-4 thereunder under the federal riot boosting statutes. The court also found that defendants violated Section 22-10-6 of the riot boosting statute, which requires defendants to show cause and effect of a riot when engaging in a riot, and that defendants are liable for civil penalties under the riot-boosting statutes.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17(b)(2) and Litigation Alert No. 206 (3).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of North Dakota, and the Department of Justice in this matter."
