  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Arkansas today entered a final judgment against the Arkansas Department of Human Services (DHS) that terminated his parental rights to his daughter, A.F. Norris.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that Norris violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the SEC's findings, Norris failed to comply with the court's order to terminate parental rights and failed to maintain meaningful contact with his daughter. In addition, the court found that Norris had failed to cooperate with the conducting of a home study conducted by the DHS, and that he did not participate in the review-hearing process. The court also found that, in considering potential harm caused by returning the child to her father, Norris did not take steps to resolve issues with his driver's license, complete the required home study, and provide assistance with transportation. In a parallel action, the SEC today announced that it has obtained a temporary restraining order and an order freezing Norris's assets, including his right to reapply as a father, and a court order requiring him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the Department of Health and Human Services filed a civil injunctive action against Norris, charging him with violations of Section 13(b)(5) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"). Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Norris consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to submit to a drug and alcohol assessment, and requires him to participate in a court-ordered home study. The final judgment also prohibits Norris from participating in the case plan or following the orders of the court following the permanency-planning hearing. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, a conduct-based injunction, and civil penalties against Norris and the McCoys. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and the case will be supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
