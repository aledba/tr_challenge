  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Ricardo Gutierrez, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 68 years in prison for the October 28, 2007 murder of Javier Barrios.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Gutierrez was arrested in the early morning hours of the morning hours on October 29, 2007, and was subsequently charged with second degree murder.  The SEC alleges that, after being arrested, defendant gave oral and written statements to police in which he claimed that he had been shot and killed in a parking lot near the Meijer gas station in Plainfield, Illinois. The complaint further alleges that the police confronted defendant with those statements and arrested him shortly after he made them.  As alleged in the complaint, the officers confronted defendant and Escutia, who was going to assert her fifth amendment right not to testify at trial, and then confronted the defendant with the incriminating statements. The defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Gutierrez consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, imposes a conduct-based injunction, and prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any such injunction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Gutierrez. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gaunt and Mr. Gempel. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the U.N. Secret Service, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
