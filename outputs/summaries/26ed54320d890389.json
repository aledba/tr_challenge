  "summary": "On October 4, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, defendants failed to disclose to the jury that they had access to records of at least 66,799 individuals who had been held or incarcerated at the BCCF from 1938 through 2011.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants violated Section 9104 of the Exchange Act, and failed to inform the jury of the risk of harm caused to individual defendants.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 9103, and orders them to pay $1,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' motion for a new trial on the basis of the jury's finding that they violated the federal securities laws, and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2,000 each.   The court's order also prohibits the defendants from violating the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and orders the Defendants to pay a civil monetary penalty in the form of a civil asset freeze and an officer-and-director bar.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 559 (3d Cir. 1999).  The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunction, and the return of any civil monetary penalties.  On October 5, 2020, the Court granted a motion for preliminary injunction against further violations of the securities laws and issued a temporary restraining order against the Defendants from further disseminating or circumventing the facts of the case. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David R. Gumbs, Kelly L. Gibson, Patrick J. McCluskey, and Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office, with the assistance of the Office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Police Department, the Pennsylvania State Corporation Commission, and"
