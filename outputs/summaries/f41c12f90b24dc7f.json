  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arkansas today entered a final judgment against nine defendants in a class action action brought by a nursing home and rehabilitation center.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that defendants Dafony Boyd, Deana Atkins-Davis, Latoyia Floyd, and Hannah Barnes violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants worked as non-exempt, hourly-paid, licensed practical nurses (LPN) and certified nursing assistants (CNAs) at a nursing facility known as \"Northridge\" or \"the facility.\"  The complaint alleges that the defendants were not members of a class and were not entitled to class certification because the facility had a common policy and practice of deducting a thirty-minute meal break from the plaintiffs' and putative class members' hours worked each shift whether or not those employees were actually able to take the break.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Infinity and Skyline have agreed to the entry of judgments that impose permanent injunctions, impose civil penalties, and order the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 2, 2019, the U. S. District Judge in the Western District of North Carolina granted a temporary restraining order and issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the court as part of the class-certification proceeding.  A hearing on June 21, 2018, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  This hearing is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Arkansas Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
