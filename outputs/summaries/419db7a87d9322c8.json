  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against Mastro's Steakhouse, Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based restaurant chain, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed on May 25, 2018 in federal court in Washington, DC, alleges that, from at least 2015 to the present, Mastro\u2019s violated the federal securities laws by failing to pay certain of its servers a base hourly wage below the federal minimum.  According to the complaint, the company also required servers to pool tips with other employees who did not \"customarily and regularly receive tips.\"  The complaint further alleges that the company failed to inform its servers that it required them to share tips with others, and failed to do so.  In addition, the complaint alleges that certain of those servers did not have the requisite training or experience to qualify for conditional certification.  As a result, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Finally, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the Court granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction, entered by the court on May 24, 2018, and entered by consent on May 26, 2018 that the court will consider the merits of the case.  On May 25 and July 24, 2019, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against the defendant.  To learn more about this matter, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Feb. 26, 2019).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit, under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the United States Postal Inspection Service in this matter."
