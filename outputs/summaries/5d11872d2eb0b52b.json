  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona today entered a final judgment against Creditor Capital Management Fund, LP (\"Creditor\"), a California company in the business of making loans to charter schools.  According to the court's order, filed on January 5, 2018, Debtor entered into a series of factoring agreements with Charter Asset Management Fund to \"claw back\" certain transfers of its own property that were avoidable under \u00a7547(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.  The court found that the material non-settling evidence presented by Debtor was insufficient to warrant the granting of summary judgment.  In addition, the court held that the amount of the preferential payments received during the preference period was \"unavoidable,\" and that the preferential treatment was not sufficient to satisfy the creditor's initial burden of production.  Debtor's complaint, filed in bankruptcy court on February 14, 2017, alleges that the bankruptcy court improperly granted summary judgment to Debtor on the basis of its \"new value\" affirmative defense, when it should have provided an additional $54,000 offset against any sum that was ultimately deemed avoidable in a hypothetical liquidation of the estate.  As alleged in the complaint, in its response to the judgment Debtor filed a second motion for summary judgment on the same basis, which was denied on the ground that it was not entitled to summary judgment because it failed to meet its obligations under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint Debtor has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 5, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Credtor has also agreed to a settlement where it will be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, offer or sale of any securities in the public company or by participating in a public offering of any security interest in the company's name, subject to court approval.  It also agreed that the court should consider whether to grant summary judgment based on its finding that it had sufficient evidence to determine whether it was entitled to an offset under the new value affirmative defense.  Finally, it agreed to pay an $8,500 civil penalty, which is subject to Court approval, for a period of 90 days after the filing of the complaint.   The settlement is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC"
