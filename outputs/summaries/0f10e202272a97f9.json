  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against four corporate defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that defendants violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws by failing to adequately disclose to investors that certain of the defendants were directly or indirectly liable for the alleged discharge of toxic substances.  According to the complaint, defendants were not permitted to disclose the nature and nature of their violations to investors, and instead engaged in a pattern of conduct that resulted in serious medical and developmental injuries.  In addition, the complaint alleges defendants failed to adequately represent to investors the risks posed by their conduct.  For example, the SEC alleges that defendant Renco, Doe Run Resources, Cayman Holdings, and Rennert did not adequately disclose that they had engaged in conduct that caused serious harm to the investors.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from future violations of the securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any securities in the United States.  On May 12, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Mascianica entered final judgments against the defendants, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.   The court's order also imposed a temporary restraining order, which prohibits defendants from making or selling any offering of securities, and ordered a hearing on May 13, 2018 to determine whether to proceed with the case against Renco and Doe Run. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael R. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Schlegelmilch, and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.
