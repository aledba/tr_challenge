  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Nevada today announced criminal charges against a Southern Nevada-based real estate developer for defrauding investors in a multi-unit residential community.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Las Vegas, alleges that the Federal Arbitration Act of 1940 (\"FAA\") preempts certain arbitration provisions of the federal securities laws. For example, the complaint alleges that, in 2013 and 2014, the SEC issued an order requiring the purchase and sale of a home subject to an arbitration provision that prohibited class arbitration. The complaint further alleges that in 2014, a federal court in Nevada issued a temporary restraining order halting the issuance of the arbitration provision.  According to the complaint, the court found that the arbitration provisions violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that, contrary to the SEC's findings, the arbitration clause in the agreement was not enforceable, and that the court had no jurisdiction over the matter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, the Court granted the Homeowners' request for an injunction, ordered the purchase of a unit within the common-interest community, and ordered the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the violations of the Commission on Contracts with Disabilities (CCDs) and Rules of Practice (RPA) thereunder, and requires the purchase, sale, or purchase of any unit subject to the CCDs to be subject to a court-ordered injunction.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0the subject matter\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0arbitration\u00c2\u00a0instant action\u00c2\u00a0against\u00c2\u00a0one of\u00c2\u00a0those\u00c2\u00a0companies\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0violated\u00c2\u00a0regardless of whether they had entered into an arbitration agreement\u00c2\u00a0with\u00c2\u00a0a reasonable expectation that\u00c2\u00a0they\u00c2\u00a0would\u00c2\u00a0find\u00c2\u00a0reasonable basis for\u00c2\u00a0compliance with\u00c2\u00a0requirements\u00c2\u00a0under the\u00c2\u00a0FAA&Rs\u00c2\u00a0for\u00c2\u00a0investor\u00c2\u00a0adherence to\u00c2\u00a0additional\u00c2\u00a0rules\u00c2\u00a0including\u00c2\u00a0comprehensive\u00c2\u00a0review\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0exchange\u00c2\u00a0thereunder.\u00c2\u00a0here"
