  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against a Kansas insurance company and its owner in a civil injunctive action arising from an automobile accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that Devin Wilson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") by driving his vehicle at an excessive speed and crashing into the rear of a vehicle containing a driver and a passenger.  According to the complaint, Wilson claimed that, 18 months after the accident, he had been paid for his medical expenses under the personal injury protection (PIP) coverage of his own automobile insurance policy.  Wilson's complaint alleges that, as a result of his actions, Wilson was entitled to a total of $8,732.71 in damages, including $3,081 covering his own medical expenses, and to a civil penalty of $4,000.  In a parallel action, the Kansas Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against Wilson.  On May 2, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the Court of Appeals granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Wilson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $7,192.71, $1,831.95, and $3.081 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil money penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly and easily identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, the SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions to quickly identify whether there are any conflicts of interest.\u00c2\u00a0In a related case, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges related to Wilson's conduct in a related administrative proceeding."
