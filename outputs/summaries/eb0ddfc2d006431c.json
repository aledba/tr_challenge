  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against Harvey Haney, a former resident of Michigan, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed on May 3, 2016, alleges that defendants were raising approximately 20 domestic hogs on their property in violation of a local ordinance.  According to the complaint, Haney admitted that he began raising the hogs in 2006 and that defendants had actually begun to raise them on the property after 2006.  As alleged, however, the complaint did not allege that defendants continued to raise hogs after 2006, and defendants did not move to amend their affirmative defenses until after it was raised in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Haney.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these federal statutes, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  Additionally, the court granted Haney's motion for summary disposition, which is subject to court approval, to a six-year general period of limitations.  Haney has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions, and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.   The settlement is pending final approval by the Court of Appeals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Michigan Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Michigan Attorney General's Office."
