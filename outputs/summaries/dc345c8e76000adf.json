  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against Kevin Lee, Jr., a Seattle man who was convicted of two counts of rape in the second degree.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, alleges that Lee violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Lee also alleges that the court improperly presumed Lee's waiver of his right to testify, which is required by the federal securities laws.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of Lee\u2019s conduct, he was unable to maintain an erection or maintain a reasonable level of confidence in his ability to make good decisions.  According to the complaint, Lee also failed to convince the court that he was entitled to a waiver of the right to participate in a double jeopardy trial, and that he should not have been required to pay DOC supervision fees as part of his sentence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Lee consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On May 15, 2018, the court granted Lee's motion for a new trial and ordered him to enter and complete a MRT program, which requires him to show that he is competent to make an informed decision regarding his own safety and personal safety in relation to his association with Lee. The court also ordered Lee to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  A hearing scheduled for May 24, 2018 is scheduled for 7:30 a.m. for Lee.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Lee."
