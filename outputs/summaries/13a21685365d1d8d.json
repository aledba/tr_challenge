  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Mooresville, Illinois woman for her role in an alleged drug-related death.  According to the SEC's complaint, on June 23, 2016, an officer entered the apartment of a woman who was in the process of recovering from an apparent drug overdose. The complaint alleges that B.P. Price, a five-year-old who had been living in the apartment at the time of the alleged drug overdose, was found unconscious on the floor of the apartment. The SEC alleges that the officer entered Price's apartment at approximately 10:38 a.m. and immediately began searching the apartment for evidence. The court granted the officer's request for a search warrant, which was granted by the court on May 26, 2016. The judge granted the warrant on May 27, 2018.  The complaint further alleges that on May 25, 2018, Price and her boyfriend, Steven Ingalls, left the apartment and returned to the apartment to search for evidence related to the alleged overdose.  As alleged in the complaint, the officers found evidence of drug use in Price's phone, including a blood spot on the carpet and inside the closet, and a flathead screwdriver on a table that had blood on it. In addition, Price allegedly told the officer that she was going to the hospital to check the phone and that she \"didn't want her to miss out on any opportunity to help the doctors in the hospital.\"  The court also denied the officers' request for an asset freeze.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Department for New Jersey today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Price, charging her with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Price consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders her to return to her apartment, and orders the officer to obtain a warrant to search her phone. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Mascianica of the New York Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Criminal Justice. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Schlegelmilch. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office."
