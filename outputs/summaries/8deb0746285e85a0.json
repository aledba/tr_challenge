  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a defendant who claimed to be S.C.R.'s biological father.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Ohio, on August 21, 2016, a Nevada resident filed a complaint for custody of a minor child in Ohio.  The complaint alleges that the juvenile court improperly dismissed the child's complaint without taking any testimony or evidence as to whether it had subject matter jurisdiction to rule on the complaint.  As alleged in the complaint, the court found that the child had been born in Nevada prior to the birth of the child, and that \"the minor child was born in Las Vegas, Nevada on 8/21/2016.\"  The court also found that, based on the facts in this case, the child was not in Ohio at the time Father filed his complaint, and neither parent or person acting as a parent had ever resided with the child.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's judgment, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the defendant.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and supervised by Lara S. Mehraban of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Department of Juvenile Justice, the FBI, and the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation in this matter."
