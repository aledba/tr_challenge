  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against Clark County, Wash., District Attorney General Eric H. Schmidt, and five other individuals for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, alleges that the Clark County Board of Supervisors issued an order on April 24, 2017, that required Clark County to comply with the GMA, and that it failed to timely serve its petition for judicial review.  According to the complaint, the Board found that Clark County violated the federal law by failing to adequately respond to the Commission\u2019s recommendation.  In its order, the Commission found that the County violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission&rsquo;s complaint, Schmidt and Schmidt consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin the Commission from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and order Schmidt to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000.  Schmidt and Schlegel agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction, and Schmidt agreed to pay a $2,500 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years. Schmidt also agreed to be prohibited from participating in the creation, operation, promotion, or promotion of any public agency. The Commission also agreed not to impose a penny stock bar against Schmidt, Schmidt, or Schmidt. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.    The Commission's complaint charges the County with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar. The complaint also seeks an order appointing a receiver to oversee Clark County's land use and development efforts.  On May 11, the SEC filed a complaint against the County, alleging that it violated Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, and aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, as well as an order requiring the County to submit a plan for the development and amendment of its land use plan. In addition, the complaint seeks a court order ordering Schmidt to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, and to pay civil penalties. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt"
