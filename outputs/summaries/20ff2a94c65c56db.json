  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Michael Leon Bell, Jr., who was convicted of orchestrating a double-murder and attempted capital murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on January 20, 1997, defendant Christopher R. \"Tory\" Bell entered into a plea agreement in which he agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Bell to comply with the court's order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Bell.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Bell agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,038, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Bell consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, and imposing a $10,000 civil penalty against him.  He also agreed to pay a $20,000 penalty, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  On May 24, 2017, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the U.N. Division of Justice issued an order suspending Bell from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney in the case of a defendant who had been convicted of a felony and sentenced to life in prison without the right to participate in the selection of a jury.  To learn more about jury selection, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2017.  For further information on jury selection and recidivism, see Judgment No. 10-20-2017, Order No. 13-14-1-1.   The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice in this matter."
