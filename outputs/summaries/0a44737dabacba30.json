  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Valley Farm Dairy Company, Inc. (\"Valley Farm\"), a Missouri-based dairy company, for violating the federal workers' compensation law.  According to the SEC's complaint, from 1968 to 1984, Vincent Hegger worked for Valley Farm performing maintenance duties. As alleged in the complaint, Hegger was exposed to asbestos at work and developed mesothelioma. The complaint alleges that he was last exposed to the hazards of asbestos while working for the company.  The complaint further alleges that when the company was not in existence as of January 1, 2014, it elected to accept liability for the benefits provided in Section 287.200.4(3)(a) because it was not required to provide the Division of Workers Compensation with notice of an election to accept the benefits.  In a parallel action, the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services today announced that it has issued an order suspending the benefits of the company, Amerisure Insurance Company, and Travelers Indemnity Company of America, which is liable for liability under the company's insurance policy, from August 2013 through January 2015.   The SEC's Complaint alleges that the Commission erred in concluding that Valley Farm did not meet its burden of proving entitlement to the benefits under the employer's policy and therefore could not elect to accept them under the new rules.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Valley Farm consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov.
