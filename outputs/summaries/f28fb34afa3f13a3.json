  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against a Bremerton man who was convicted of two felony counts of identity theft and theft in the first degree.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia on May 29, 2017, Albert J. Smith, a former bookkeeper at Spaeth Transfer, was found guilty of both of those counts.  The SEC alleges that Smith violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Smith also was found liable for violating Section 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(2)(A) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  Smith agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $264,500.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Smith consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions and ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Smith.  On May 30, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Smith, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a penalty equal to the amount of his prior criminal convictions.  A hearing on May 31, 2018 was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. Eastern.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of the District Attorney and the case was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC's litigation will be led by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2017."
