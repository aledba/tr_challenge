  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against Southern California Gas Company and its former attorney, Patrick J. Flannery, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 23, 2013, Flannery and his attorney, Scott Tepper, filed an emergency action in which they sought a court-ordered injunction against Flannery's motion for attorney fees and costs, and the court ultimately granted them.

The court's order temporarily froze the assets of the defendants and ordered the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest of $1.4 million.  Judge Wiley also issued an emergency order suspending the defendants from appearing, practicing, or appearing before a court in the Southern California district court as part of a case involving the alleged misappropriation of funds from the defendants.  Finally, on September 11, 2015 Judge Wiley granted the attorneys' request for a preliminary injunction, which requires the parties to show cause and effect, and to pay civil penalties of $500,000 and $1 million, respectively.
