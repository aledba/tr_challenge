  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against Sherrod Harkleroad, a convicted felon who was later sentenced to prison for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 3, 2017, Sherrod alleges that he was placed in restraints and transported down the steps from his cell towards the prison\u2019s recreation area. As Sherrod neared the bottom of the stairs, he suffered a seizure, causing him to fall down the remaining steps.  The complaint alleges that Sherrod ignored his seizure disorder and assigned him to an upper-tier cell located in an upper tier of the prison.  As alleged in the complaint, he ignored his physical disability and assigned Sherrod to a cell that required him to traverse stairs while handcuffed.  Sherrod also alleges that Johnson and Bass conspired with the custody staff by making false witness statements that did not raise any issues with Sherrod.  In addition to Morgan, Bass and Johnson also allegedly made false statements to the court regarding Sherrod's seizure disorder, and Sherrod was unable to appeal the earlier dismissals of Morgan and Bass.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the court agreed to the final judgment that permanently enjoins Sherrod from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  On January 4, 2018, the Honorable Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued a Final Judgment that permanently restrains the court order and orders Sherrod and Bass to comply with the court's order, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.   The court also granted Sherrod a temporary restraining order prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, and an officer-and-director bar in the event of a court order granting Sherrod an injunction or otherwise requiring him to surrender his right to a lawyer or other officer to facilitate his entry of a judgment imposing permanent injunctions against future violations.  Finally, on January 5, 2020, the Court issued an order appointing a receiver to monitor Sherrod for signs of a seizure disorder that could cause him to become a danger to himself or others.  This receiver was later transferred to a different prison and the receiver was subsequently placed in a wheelchair.  To learn more about the receiver, see"
