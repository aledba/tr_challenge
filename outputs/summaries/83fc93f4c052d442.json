  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a former CMCI employee for his role in a scheme to steal millions of dollars from the company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Mark M. Duhon, a registered representative with the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Justice, and his wife, Donna S. Guarisco, conducted a forensic analysis of the company's books and records to determine whether the company was a legitimate entity for the purpose of laundering and money laundering. The SEC alleges that the defendants were not authorized to use the company funds for a legitimate purpose, and instead used the company money for personal expenses, including paying personal expenses and for the purchase of two vehicles. The complaint further alleges that, on at least one occasion, the defendants made unauthorized checks into the company account and deposited the checks into a separate bank account.  According to the complaint, the defendant also allegedly signed checks that were not registered with the company, and that he did not write.  In addition, the complaint alleges that one of the defendants signed checks for $9,000.00, which he claimed was for his retirement, and another check for $20,000 was deposited into the defendant's personal bank account for $1,500.00.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The judgment also orders the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations. The court also granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 5, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation of the alleged scheme was conducted by David A. Kasper of the New York office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson."
