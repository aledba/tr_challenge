  "summary": "On March 25, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against the California Board of Supervisors for failing to properly evaluate the effectiveness of a market-based offset program.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, alleges that the Board exceeded its authority under the 2006 California Cap-and-Trade program by failing to determine whether a project should qualify for an offset credit.  According to the complaint, the Board failed to consider whether it had the statutory authority to determine how many offset credits to qualify for, and how much to pay for, the offset credits.  In addition, the complaint alleges that one of the offset credit provisions of the 2006 Act was inconsistent and inconsistent with the Board's intent.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the Commission's Compliance Offset Protocols (CDT) and the early action offset credit (AP&A) did not meet the requirements of the Commission, and neither did the implementation of the CDT.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission&A&B&A, the Court granted the Commission &A&A's request for a writ of mandamus, a temporary restraining order, and an order appointing a receiver to determine the appropriate timing and amount of offset credits for each offset credit project. The Commission also issued an order requiring the District Attorney's Office to conduct an independent review of the adequacy and effectiveness of the program. The SEC&A also instituted an administrative proceeding against the Board, which is subject to court approval.  On March 26, 2013 the court issued a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 38562(d)(2) of the federal securities laws, ordering the Board to comply with the court's order. The court also ordered the Commission to provide an accounting of the impact of the proposed offset credit program on the program's progress. The Court also ordered that the Commission and its receiver determine whether any offset credits will be eligible for a penny-per-share investment.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 24, 2013.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17.  An SEC Complaint against the Commission seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.
