  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was sentenced to death for his role in a series of high-level drug and mental retardation cases.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boise, Idaho, alleges that Gerald Ross Pizzuto, Jr., a convicted felon with a history of drug abuse and epilepsy, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  In its judgment, the court found that the Idaho state court improperly applied a \"hard IQ-70 cutoff\" to determine whether a defendant had a pre-18 IQ.  According to the court's order, however, the state court failed to consider whether the IQ test was reasonable because it was not consistent with the clinical definitions in place at the time.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Pizzut has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires him to provide the court with an IQ test score of 70 or below.  On May 2, 2020, the Court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and ordered a hearing on the matter to be scheduled for May 24, 2020.  To learn more about intellectual disabilities, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 10, 2020).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Minnesota today announced criminal charges against the defendant. The SEC also announced that it was seeking a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 2254(d)(1) and Rule 206(2)-8 thereunder, as well as a permanent injunction against future violations.  A hearing is scheduled for June 21, 2020 to determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  For further information, see Judgment No. 206 (January 9, 2020) and Order No. 207 (January 13, 2020); Order No 9-1-1 (January 12, 2020), Order No 10(b) or 13(b)(5) or (11) thereunder; Order No 13-20 (April 24, 2008).  The court also ordered the defendant to submit to the SEC a copy of the final judgment, which is subject to court approval.  Among other things, the SEC previously issued an order requiring defendants to provide evidence of impairment in the course of their criminal proceedings, including that the defendant had demonstrated sufficient intellectual functioning to be eligible for a hearing."
