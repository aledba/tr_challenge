  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a former City of Winston-Salem employee for his role in a car accident.  According to the SEC's complaint, on October 22, 2015, Larry Brooks was employed as a Senior Crew Coordinator in the Utilities Department. As alleged in the complaint, Brooks was on his lunch break at a gas station when he became ill and began coughing uncontrollably. The complaint alleges that Brooks, who had previously suffered from epileptic convulsions for many years and could \"feel one of these seizures when it was coming on\" during his trip to Washington, D.C.  Brooks was required to drive a pick-up truck to perform water and sewer line repairs throughout the city. As a result of his ill-health, Brooks had been out of his medication since April and was unable to return to work in the position he was performing on the date of the accident. Brooks was subsequently diagnosed with L3, L4 transverse process fractures and came under the care of Dr. Dahari Brooks, a board-certified orthopedist, who was responsible for determining whether and when breaks would be taken, and responsible for the crew during breaks. Brooks agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael T. Silver and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
