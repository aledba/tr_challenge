  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Andrew Wolfington on his claim under the Truth in Lending Act of 1940.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Wolfington violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Wolfington agreed to have surgery provided by Rothman, scheduled for January 21, 2016, and failed to make any payments to Rothman.  Wolfington also allegedly failed to disclose that Rothman had extended credit to him in a \"written agreement\" with respect to payment of pre-existing and newly incurred debts.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Wolfington.  On January 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, charging Wolfington with violating Rule 12(b)(6) and requiring him to pay $38,447.91 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and order Wolfington to pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $50,000.  Additionally, the court granted Wolfington a temporary restraining order, barring him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, and an officer-and-director bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  To settle the SEC case, the parties agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a final judgment that enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws and orders them to pay civil monetary penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
