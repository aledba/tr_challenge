  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against Terrell Willyard, Jr., who was charged with DWI following a single-vehicle collision in which Willyard's vehicle collided with a telephone pole.  The court found that, contrary to the court\u2019s order, Willyard was not guilty of DWI when the jury found him guilty of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The court also ruled that the defendant was not liable for a new trial because there was insufficient evidence to determine whether he was impaired at the time he was driving.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New Mexico announced criminal charges against Willyard.  According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in federal district court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on May 10, 2016, the court granted Willyard a temporary restraining order preventing him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to submit to field sobriety tests and chemical testing. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 13, 2017, the U. S. District Judge for the Western District of N.M. entered a judgment permanently enjoining Willyard from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and ordering him to comply with Rule 5-614, which requires a district court to consider the merits of a defendant's criminal case before it can issue a judgment. The Court also ordered Willyard to pay disgorgement of $1,078, plus prejudgment interest of $2,038, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively.  Without admitting, however, that the court found Willyard liable for DWI, and granted him a permanent restraining order prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of securities in the securities industry, including securities in exchange for a share of a penny in a public offering of a security deposit. The Judge also granted the motion for a retrial, without citing any evidence of impairment, and entered a written order suppressing the evidence. The jury deliberated for less than two hours before finding Willyard guilty of violating Section 5(b).  The Court issued its final judgment on May 12, 2017."
