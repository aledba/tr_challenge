  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment in a criminal case against a Scranton, Pennsylvania man for defrauding a homeowner out of more than $71,000. The court also ordered him to pay $6,700.00 in restitution.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that, on April 14, 2015, Joseph Petrick contracted with a homeowner, Donna Sabia, to perform remodeling work on the home. According to the complaint, Sabia agreed to pay restitution in the amount of $3,500.00 plus $300.00 to cover the cost of city permits. The complaint alleges that Sabia and her son, Carmen Fazio, entered into a second contract for Appellant to do some painting in the home, which was to be completed within seven days. As alleged, the second contract was never completed, and the payment of the restitution order did not occur until after the completion of the painting. The SEC alleges that the second payment of restitution in this case was unrelated to the purpose of the second restitution order.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Petrick consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 523(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code. The final judgment also prohibits Petrick from seeking or recommending restitution as part of a civil penalty for a prior criminal conviction and orders Petrick to pay disgorgement of $4,950.00 with prejudgment interest of $1,750.00 and a $600.00 civil penalty. Petrick agreed to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any debt in a bankruptcy proceeding, and to pay a penalty equal to or greater than the amount owed to him by the creditor. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Petrick has agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, to an officer-and-director bar, to a conduct-based injunction, to"
