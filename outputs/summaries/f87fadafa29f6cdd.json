  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a California-based arbitrator in a medical malpractice case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that a neutral arbitrator failed to disclose to the parties that he or she had improperly performed a hysterectomy on plaintiff.  According to the complaint, the arbitrator also failed to inform the parties of his or her inability to resolve the matter.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant failed to adequately disclose to his counsel that he had signed two arbitration agreements that were untimely and did not comply with the requirements of Section 1286.2 of the Commission on Arbitration Rules.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his and her husband\u2019s legal fees.  Finally, the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordered the parties to comply with a court order requiring them to provide a copy of the arbitration agreement to the court.  On August 24, 2011, the trial court issued an order vacating an arbitration award against defendant and appointing an arbitrator based on the finding that the arbitration award was not subject to reasonable determination by the court as to whether the parties had waived the right to arbitrate, and that defendant had failed to timely respond to the arbitration request.   The court also found that defendant did not have the requisite knowledge or experience to determine whether to issue a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to provide an accounting of the costs and benefits of each arbitration award.  Additionally, the Court found that defendants failed to provide sufficient evidence to justify vacating the award based on their or their parties\u2019 failure to disclose material facts about the case, including the fact that plaintiff had not requested a jury trial in the past, failed to request arbitration in the future, and failed to check the background of a defendant who had submitted a written opinion in the case that was not supported by the facts presented in the final judgment.  It also ruled that defendants had not provided sufficient information to justify their decision to vacate the award and that the court had not acted as a reasonable judge to determine the appropriate amount of compensation to be paid by the parties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the San Diego Regional Office. "
