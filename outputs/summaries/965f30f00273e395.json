  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered final judgments against Farm Bureau General Insurance Company of Michigan and its owner Debra Batton-Jajuga in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Michigan, alleges that Farm Bureau violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws when it insured real property in Monroe, Michigan up to $289,000.  According to the complaint, when she purchased the property in April 2015, Farm Bureau refused to pay any replacement costs.  Instead, the complaint alleges that she spent $46.629.58 (the down payment and several monthly installments) on the property, which was less than the actual cash value of the property.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Farm Bureau from violating these provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $93,000, $1,085.33 in nonrecoverable depreciation, and a $100,000 prepayment penalty.  Farm Bureau also agreed to pay $75,000 in pre-judgment interest and $50,000 of contractual attorney fees and interest.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.
