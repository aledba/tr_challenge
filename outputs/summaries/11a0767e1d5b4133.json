  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant David Lee Meils, who was convicted of four counts of sexual exploitation of a child.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Meils violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Meils has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requires him to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations.  In its order, the court also ordered Meils to surrender his work and personal phones, including his work phone, and ordered him to provide an accounting of all of the alleged misconduct in the case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Meils consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from further violations of these provisions, and ordering him to disgorge $1,038,078, which he has already agreed to pay, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  According to the SEC\u2019s order:    (1) The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney for the Central District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U. S. Attorney\u2019S Office for the Northern District of California.  (2) The Court also granted Meils a temporary restraining order, which prohibits Meils from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, including securities in the securities industry, and a penny stock bar. (3) The court also denied Meils\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction against future securities laws violations, which includes the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order, ordering the destruction of any evidence that may be relevant to the case, and imposing a $10,000 civil penalty against Meils. (4)  The court further granted the motion for an officer-and-director bar and a bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  It also granted the SEC the right to request an asset freeze and a conduct-based injunction against further violation of the securities laws. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David L. Meils and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Denver Regional Office. The SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Jennifer C. Barry and Eric Werner."
