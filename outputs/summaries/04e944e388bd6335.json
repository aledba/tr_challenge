  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against a Utah man who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 30-3-3 of the federal child custody and parent-time laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Casey Lee Mackelprang, who was previously charged by the court for his role in a previous child custody case, raised the issue of whether the court should impose an order requiring Father to pay the entire cost of a custody evaluation.  According to the complaint, the court found that Father failed to present sufficient evidence to justify imposing an order imposing the order, and instead ordered him to pay a portion of the total cost of the custody evaluation, which he did not do.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Utah today announced criminal charges against Father.   The complaint further alleges that the court improperly ordered Father to participate in the child custody evaluation without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Father violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting to these allegations, Father consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, imposes a $75,000 civil penalty, and requires him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  Father also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and ordered to pay an $8,500 civil penalty in the amount of $1,500. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Aug. 24, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Office of Child and Family Education, the Utah Department of Justice, and the Utah Division of Criminal Justice."
