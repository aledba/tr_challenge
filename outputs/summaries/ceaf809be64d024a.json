  "summary": "On May 13, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against a defendant in a related administrative proceeding.  The court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the payment of $140,238.97 in attorneys' fees and costs associated with a successful action under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Washington D.C. on July 1, 2016, the defendants agreed to settle the case by agreeing to pay a fee equal to 75% of the agreed-upon rate for services performed by attorneys and paralegals/law clerks under the IDEA. The court also granted the parties' request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York today announced criminal charges against one of the defendants. The SEC's complaint charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders the defendants to pay the amount of their fees, which is subject to court approval, to be determined by the court at a later date. The settlement is pending final approval by the Court.  On August 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Mascianica of the Court of Appeals issued an order granting the defendants a temporary asset freeze and ordering the issuance of an order appointing an independent receiver. The order also prohibits the defendants from participating in any offering of attorney's fees or costs, and requires the court to determine whether the fees are adequately reimbursed by the parties.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 24, 2019).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
