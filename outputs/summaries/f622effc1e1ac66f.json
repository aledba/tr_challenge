  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Neiman Nix and DNA Sports Performance Lab, Inc., a Florida-based sports training center, for defamatory statements in a news article about Nix's ongoing lawsuit against the Major League Baseball.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, Florida, alleges that Nix, through DNA, falsely claimed that his company used bioidentical insulin like growth factor (IGF-1), which is derived from elk antlers, to produce performance enhancing drugs to MLB players.  According to the complaint, however, the statement was false and misleading.  Nix also alleged that the statement did not distinguish between natural and synthetic IGF-1, and thus implied that Appellees sold illegal drugs, or legal drugs in an illegal manner.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Nix has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against Nix.  On May 17, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of Florida entered a judgment ordering the SEC to conduct a preliminary examination of the complaint and determine whether it is appropriate to proceed with a civil action.  A hearing on May 24, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1322 (Aug. 24, 2013).  The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa and Antonia Chion in the Miami Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Office of Financial Regulation in this matter."
