  "summary": "On June 24, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment in favor of the city of Patterson, California, against a proposed annexation of the territory where it provides electrical services.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Stanislaus County, California on May 24, 2011, City of Patterson sought to obtain a writ of mandate to impose charges on customers who cannot vote in district elections because they reside outside the district's boundaries.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 56857 of the federal securities laws, City sought to impose the imposition of a surcharge, not a tax, on all of the customers in a service area outside TID's boundaries, thereby preventing them from participating in the municipalization process.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the surcharge was not required for TID to provide electrical services to the affected customers, and City's application was void based on other alleged procedural defects, including the water-related financial and service concerns described in the city's resolution.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, City agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 56654 and 56675 of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  In a parallel action, the California Secretary of State's Office today announced criminal charges against City.  On June 26, the SEC filed a complaint against the city, charging it with violations of the anti-fraud provisions, including Section 56657, and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting City's violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against City and TID. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Mr. B.Burt. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice in this matter."
