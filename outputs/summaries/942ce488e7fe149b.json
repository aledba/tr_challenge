  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment in favor of a Pennsylvania driver who refused to submit to a warrantless blood test.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on May 16, 2015, Thomas Bell was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and was subsequently charged with DUI.  The complaint alleges that Bell refused to participate in the search and seizure of a motorist's car because he did not want a needle in his arm because he had previously contracted hepatitis from a hospital needle.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Bell arising from his refusal.  As alleged in the complaint, Bell was subsequently convicted of DUI based on his refusal and sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's opinion, Bell consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 1547 of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000.  Bell also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any automobile, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.
