  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Missouri announced today that it has filed a civil injunctive action against defendant Gregory Orozco for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that on February 23, 2013, Deputy United States Marshals (DUSMs) converged on a pickup truck that matched the description of a fugitive\u2019s vehicle after observing one of the occupants engage in what appeared to be a drug transaction.  According to the complaint, the defendants told the driver that he would rather not testify in the first trial than to be subject to impeachment by the court.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mr. Ostrove, a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for two drug-related felony convictions, and Amy Stimec-Smart, a co-defendant in the WDMO case, for acting as an unregistered broker-dealer.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively. The defendants also agreed to be barred from serving as officers or directors of a public company, and the district court will determine the amount of money to pay the civil penalty.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Snyder granted the Defendants\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to surrender their allegedly illegal possession of a firearm.  Judge Snyder also granted the defendants\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction, which prohibits them from using the internet or using the phone to make phone calls, and issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver. The court also issued a subpoena for a copy of the subpoena, ordering the receiver to provide an accounting of all the alleged proceeds obtained from the alleged sales of the alleged illegal drugs. The SEC complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933, Section 10 of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of"
