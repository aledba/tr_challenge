  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of Carson against Imperial Avalon Mobile Estates, LLC and its owner, Thomas Heinemann.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Carson, California, alleges that, in 2009, Imperial Avalon submitted its application for conversion of its mobilehome park into resident-owned communities.  According to the complaint, the city council approved the conversion in 2010.  In its judgment, the court found that Imperial Avalon's application was not bona fide because it did not have sufficient resident support to permit the conversion.  As alleged, the complaint further alleges that in 2010, when Imperial Avalon filed its application to the city of Carson for conversion, it failed to adequately consider the number of residents who opposed the conversion and failed to provide sufficient evidence to determine whether the conversion was bona fide.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's judgment, Imperial and Heineman consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Imperial to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.   The court also granted the city's request for a writ of mandate, which requires the city to consider the merits of the conversion before it can issue an order requiring the conversion to be approved by the federal district court for the Southern District of New York. \u00c2\u00a0The court's order, which was entered in a parallel administrative proceeding, orders Imperial to comply with the court's orders, and requires it to provide a copy of the final judgment, which is subject to approval by the court upon motion of the district court.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Court of Appeals for the Second Appellate District of Nevada today issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order. The order also orders the city attorney to conduct an independent review of the proposed conversion. The court granted the City attorney's request to appoint a receiver for the receiver, and ordered the receiver to provide the receiver with an accounting of the receiver's assets, including any assets that may have been lost in the conversion process. The receiver will determine whether to issue the receiver an order appointing a receiver based on the findings of the city manager's review.  Finally, the receiver will provide an accounting for any losses that may be incurred by the receiver in the receiver."
