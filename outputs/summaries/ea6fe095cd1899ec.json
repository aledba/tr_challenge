  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida yesterday entered a final judgment against Honeywell International, Inc. (\u201cHoneywell\u201d), a Florida-based energy company, on the basis of a finding that it improperly relied on an incomplete conclusory label to determine whether a company was a necessary party under Rule 19(b) of the federal securities laws.  The court also found that, in 2009, the company had engaged in the process of replacing existing analog electricity usage meters located on its customers\u2019 residences with digital smart meters.  According to the court\u2019s order, however, that the company did not retain the right to control or direct the process, nor did the company exercise any actual control over the process.  In addition, the court found that Honeywell violated the antifraud provisions of Rule 19, including Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 19b2-3 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Honeywell agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Orlando, Florida, charges Honeywell with violating Rule 19 and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  It also seeks a temporary restraining order, an order requiring Honeywell to comply with the required disclosures in its books and records, and a court order requiring it to provide a complete accounting of the company's progress in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the SEC's Miami Regional Office and the case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Insurance."
