  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Massachusetts on December 18, 2017, entered a final judgment against a Springfield, Massachusetts man who was convicted of two counts of extortion and one count of aiding and abetting the same.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Richard Valentini, who owns and operates CJ's Towing, attempted to extort money from Craig Morel, the owner of an interstate towing company, through means such as threatening Morel with death, striking Morel in the face, and telling Morel he would have to pay the mob to provide kickbacks to city officials to ensure that Morel and his company retained these contracts.  Morel complied and paid the kickbacks, but Santaniello, Calabrese, Depergola, and others allegedly threatened Morel's life if he did not comply with the extortion demands.  According to the complaint, Morel stopped making those payments after the company lost its City of Springfield towing contract in October 2003.  In November 2013, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Morel to return to his home to collect the remaining $15,000 owed to Morel.  Last week, a federal district court in Springfield issued an order suspending the suspension of Morel from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On December 19, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone entered a judgment against Valentini that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $20,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Valentini has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  Separately, the SEC announced criminal charges against Morel related to the same conduct alleged in the complaint.   The court also ordered the payment of civil penalties in the parallel criminal case. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Massachusetts State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
