  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) for violating the federal securities laws by failing to install or maintain a guardrail on Commonwealth real estate.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that, on January 26, 2015, Joisse Cagey and Dale Cagey were driving southbound on State Route 551 when they encountered snow and ice on the road. According to the complaint, the guardrail was not installed on the roadway and was not \"crashworthy.\" The complaint further alleges that PennDOT's negligent installation of a dangerous \"boxing glove\" guardrail caused significant injuries to Mrs. Cagey, including toe, foot and leg fractures. The complaint also alleges that the company failed to properly inspect and correct the guardrail. The SEC alleges that in a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  In a parallel administrative proceeding, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against the company for violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The court also issued an order suspending the company's registration with the SEC.  On May 8, 2016, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Philadelphia granted the SEC's request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered the company to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the securities laws and orders it to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (June 22, 2015).  The complaint charges the company with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(b)(4) and (c) of Pennsylvania's securities laws, and seeks a temporary restraining order, an injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar. The company has also agreed to a settlement with the court that will permanently enjoin the company from violating these provisions."
