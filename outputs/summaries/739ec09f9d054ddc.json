  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Second Chance Homes of Fulton, LLC (\"Second Chance Homes\"), a Missouri-based company, and its principal, Bryan Keith Martin, in a wrongful death action brought by DeBrodie's biological mother, Carolyn Summers.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Missouri on May 21, 2018, the Martins sought a declaration of equitable adoption and a court order recognizing their standing as equitable adoptive parents.  The complaint alleges that, in 1999, the Cole County Circuit Court appointed Mary Martin to be the legal guardian of DeBrody, who was then thirteen years old and considered a special needs child.  As alleged in the complaint, the court found that, as a result of the court's finding, the defendants had no standing to bring a claim for wrongful death.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, First Chance Homes agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Second Chance also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million.  First Chance has agreed to a $500,000 civil penalty.  On June 22, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action against the three defendants, charging them with violations of Section 537.080 of the federal\u00c2\u00a0adoption law, and with aiding and abetting the defendants' violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0Adoption Act of 1940 and Rule\u00c2\u00a0206(4)-8 thereunder, and to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, with the amount of the civil penalty to be determined by the court at a later date.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 537-080-1 (Jan. 20, 2019).
