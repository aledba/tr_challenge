  "summary": "On January 4, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the orphans' court against Mother, finding that she violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that, in reviewing involuntary termination of parental rights decisions, the court had the authority to determine whether a parent had a conflict of interest.  According to the court's order, however, Mother was unable to address the children's significant medical needs, extensive dental problems, ongoing head lice and serious bowel disease, and the inability to place her relationship with her paramour and his children ahead of her decision to terminate her parental rights.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Mother for her role in the alleged scheme.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, charges Mother with violating Section 2511(a)(1) and (2) and the securities laws, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Mother consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars her from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom's Ministry of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Children and Family Education, the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations, the Office of the Attorney General's Assistant Chief of Inspections and Examinations, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Pennsylvania Office of Advocacy and Education (OIEA) in this matter. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. G. Reece.\u00c2\u00a0 The case will be supervised by Mr. Barry."
