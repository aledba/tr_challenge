According to the SEC's complaint, from 2012 to 2016, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued an immigration detainer to certain individuals in violation of the federal immigration laws.  The complaint alleges that the detainer was based on information that was not available to the agency at the time it issued it.  In addition, the complaint alleged that ICE failed to adequately check the accuracy of the databases it uses to determine whether a person has been removed from the country.
