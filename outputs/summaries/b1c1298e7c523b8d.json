  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Rhode Island today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Providence, Rhode Island, alleges that on September 9, 2010, defendant Julio Morais, who was charged by the SEC with five counts of first-degree child molestation, waived his right to a jury trial by signing a jury-waiver form in the cellblock of the Providence County courthouse. The complaint further alleges that, prior to trial, defendant signed the jury waiver form in open court before the trial justice. The SEC alleges that defendant's waiver did not comply with the requirements of Rule 23(a) and was therefore invalid. In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for Rhode Island announced criminal charges against Morais.  According to the complaint, Morais consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The judgment also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock or offering of any security. The court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, and ordered the SEC to conduct a hearing on the matter.  On January 19, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action, including an order suspending Morais from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering him to provide an accounting of the amount of money that he has raised from victims of the alleged crime.  In its order, the court also ordered that the SEC obtain a copy of the court's order, which is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented and signed a written waiver in the presence of a trial justice, without acknowledging or denying any of the facts of the case. The order also requires the court to determine whether the defendant is competent to proceed to a bench trial by jury.  A hearing on January 20, 2018 is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.
