  "summary": "On May 19, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Vermont entered a final judgment against Allco Renewable Energy Limited, a Vermont-based solar power company, against the PUC's denial of its motion to intervene as a party in proceedings concerning whether Green Mountain Power Corporation (GMP) could purchase power generation facilities outside of Vermont.  According to the court's order, Allco filed a complaint in September 2016 alleging that, as a ratepayer, it had a substantial interest in ensuring that any purchases of out-of-state generation facilities by GMP would be required to meet the needs of present and future demand for power generation in Vermont. The court also denied Allco's request to intervene in the CPG proceeding.  The court's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins Allco from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Allco to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, prejudgment interest of $2,038.95, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Allco has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that imposes a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws and orders it to comply with the court order.  In a parallel action, the Vermont Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting the purchase of additional power generation capacity in the state. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Scott Frost and supervised by Eric Werner. The litigation will be led by Mr. Frost and Mr. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Vermont Department of Public Works, the Department of Energy, and the Vermont Corporation Commission in this matter."
