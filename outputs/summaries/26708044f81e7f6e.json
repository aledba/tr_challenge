  "summary": "On March 24, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Innovative Commodities Group, LLC (\"Innovative\"), a Texas company that provides cargo haulage and other import and export services.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Innovative violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the complaint alleges that MTS failed to provide Innovative with a copy of its House Bill of Lading, even though it knew of the terms and conditions of that bill of lading.  MTS's complaint also alleges that, as a result of Innovative's failure to comply with the Exchange Act's requirements, MTS was not able to enforce the forum selection clause.  Innovative has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the Exchange Rules, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of its profits.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Innovative consented to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, and to the issuance of a cease-and-desist order.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and Carol S. Cotter of the New York Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and FINRA's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA)\u00c2\u00a0Investors in this matter are encouraged to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Examinations tool to quickly spot suspicious patterns of activity.  For example, the SEC encourages investors to check whether their funds are being used for a specific purpose, such as to purchase or lease a boat or to pay for a cruise.  According to the SEC\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website\u00c2\u00a0Exchange.gov,\u00c2\u00a0it is not uncommon for investors to send money to a company that is not registered with the SEC."
