  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arkansas today entered final judgments against Michael Landon Doll, a former Jasper, Missouri police officer, and his wife, Brenda, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that, on June 7, 2016, Doll was charged with three counts of attempted capital murder, aggravated residential burglary, and battery in the first degree.  According to the complaint, after receiving a call from Brenda telling him that she had suffered a \"traumatic brain injury\" in an automobile accident, Doll confronted her and told her that he had been shot in the chest and had sustained a \"really bad carpet burn.\"  The complaint alleges that after receiving the call, Doll replied, \u201c[y]ou'll be dead before the end of the day.\u201d  He also allegedly told Brenda that he was going to use a new last name and live in Bella Vista, Arkansas.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, that this was a lie, and that Doll had no training in ballistics or bullet trajectory and had no background in forensic-scene reconstruction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Missouri today announced parallel criminal charges against Doll.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action charging Doll with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Doll consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  He has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, with the right to reapply at a later date upon motion of the court upon his motion to be enjoined from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws.  To settle the case, Doll has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently barred from appearing and practicing before an SEC court.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Conte and Justin J. Burt of the Atlanta Regional Office, and is being supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter."
