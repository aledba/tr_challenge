  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maine today entered a final judgment against Brent Hercules, a British Virgin Island citizen who pleaded guilty to two felony counts of possession of a controlled substance and was sentenced to a mandatory 60-month prison sentence.  The court's order, which was entered on May 24, 2017, found that the defendant had been born in the British Virgin Islands in 1986 and had immigrated to the United States with his parents when he was three years of age. The court also found that although the appellant had been deported in the past, it was not convinced that he was certain to be deported after serving his sentence. According to the court's opinion, however, the court did not consider the likelihood of the appellant's deportation as a \"collateral consequence\" of committing a federal criminal offense. Rather, it deemed the defendant's potential deportation as \"forbidden from considering\" collateral consequences, such as difficulty securing employment and strained personal and familial relationships.\"  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement today announced that it has filed a detainer against Hercules, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Hercules consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal criminal laws, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $500,000 officer-and-director bar. The judgment also orders Hercules to surrender to ICE after serving a three-year term of supervised release. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of International Affairs and the Division of Justice's Office of Immigrant Affairs. The litigation will be led by Eric R. Kasper and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Attorney's Office for the Middle and Western Districts of England, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Homeland Security."
