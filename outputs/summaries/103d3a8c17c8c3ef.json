  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC) and Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Council, Inc. (PHNDC) for failing to comply with the requirements of the federal Environmental Quality Act (EQRA).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Brooklyn, New York, ESDC and PHNDC raised the issue of whether to proceed with a 10-year build-out of the Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn.  The complaint alleges that the ESDC failed to meet its obligations under the EQRA and failed to timely respond to requests for an SEIS for the project.  In its judgment, the court found that ESDC violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amounts of $169,626.00 and $7,900.00, respectively, and orders the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The court also granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from destroying any evidence or evidence in connection with the litigation. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the New York Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, with litigation assistance from Eric R. Werner, and the case will be supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.N.
