  "summary": "On July 19, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, for issuing a false driver's license in violation of Section 1503(a)(8) of the Vehicle Code.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Licensee, a registered driver, obtained two false licenses under the name of Mark N. Perrotta, who had been previously barred from driving by the Department. The complaint alleges that Licensee obtained the false licenses because he was unable to demonstrate rehabilitation and applied for a probationary license. Licensee also allegedly obtained a third false license, under his brother's name, for driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. The SEC alleges that the Department did not meet its burden to impose a lifetime ban on Licensee. In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office today announced that it had issued a temporary restraining order against Licensee from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1523 of the Motor Vehicle Code, Section 1524 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Sections 1533, 1539, and 1543 of the vehicle licensing and registration requirements. The Department's order, which is subject to court approval, requires the Department to consider the mitigating factors that should be considered in determining whether a lifetime license should be imposed. For example, the Department has not met its burden of proving that the conduct in question warrants the lifetime ban issued by the department.  The SEC's order also requires the department to consider whether Licensee has demonstrated rehabilitation through completing eight years of parole without violations.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the department has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, imposes a lifetime suspension of the license, and orders the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order. The court also granted the Department's request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the Court issued an order suspending Licensee's license pending a hearing on the merits of the case. The order also prohibits the Department from imposing a lifetime penalty on a person who has already violated the registration provisions of Sections 1523, 1524, or 1525, and from issuing or selling a vehicle under the brand name of \"perrotta.\" The court's order prohibits the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any type of automobile, including a motor vehicle, and prohibits the issuing of any safety or driving test. The Court granted the request for an injunction and ordered the issuance and issuance of an order"
