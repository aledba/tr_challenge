  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a domestic violence case, finding that D.P., an infant born on September 29, 2014, was at substantial risk of suffering serious emotional damage.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Jose, California on October 17, 2014 and unsealed on October 19, 2015, the defendant, James R., Jr., of Fresno, California, was placed into protective custody because of his history of domestic violence.  The complaint alleges that the father had been verbally and physically abusive to the child since birth, and that he had been drinking and acting out of control since the birth of his child.  As alleged in the complaint, the father and mother had been together since January 2014, and had been engaged in at least two relationships involving domestic violence since birth.  In one instance, the complaint further alleges that appellant had been exposed to the father's repeated domestic violence against the mother and the mother's inability and unwillingness to protect the child from exposure to that violence on several occasions.  At the time of the alleged domestic violence, appellant was in the middle of a contentious custody dispute between her parents, and she had been forced to deal with her mother's delusions.  She had been diagnosed with severe anxiety, depression, withdrawal, and untoward aggressive behavior by her father, and despite her completion of an domestic violence support group, she continued to be in a relationship with the father despite their history of physical and emotional harm.   The SEC's Complaint against the defendant alleges that, contrary to what the complaint alleges, appellant continued to minimize the impact of her father's domestic violence on her children, despite the fact that she was unable to protect her children from the father.  Additionally, the Complaint alleges that she did not recognize the risk this posed to her children and did not consider the potential consequences for her children.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC Complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 300(c) of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties.  Defendants have also agreed to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000, which is equal to the amount that Defendants have already paid in restitution to the victims of their respective domestic violence cases, and to the payment of a civil penalty of $150,000.  Defendant has also agreed not to participate in court-ordered family reunification services, to which he has agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 300,"
