  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Kelsye Hall and Kevin Patton in a vehicular homicide case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, alleges that Hall and Patton engaged in a high-speed game of \"cat and mouse\" over several miles of I-10 in the Prairieville area. According to the complaint, Hall was driving a white pick-up truck with his wife in the front passenger seat. The complaint alleges that as a result of the collision, Hall lost control of the vehicle and collided with the victims' vehicle. The SEC alleges that the defendants engaged in what appears to be a classic case of \"road rage,\" in which a defendant's intoxication causes the victim to lose control of his vehicle and collide with another vehicle. Hall's vehicle caught fire and none of its occupants were able to escape.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against Hall.  On March 13, 2011, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Hall, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Hall's and Leger's violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hall consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 14:32.1(A).  The complaint also names Hall's wife, Effie Fontenot, as a defendant who was criminally liable for the death of five victims. The court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of Hall's employer, and ordering Hall to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
