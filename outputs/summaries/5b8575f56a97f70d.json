  "summary": "On February 5, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil rights case.  The court granted the defendants' motion for reconsideration and for an interim award of attorney's fees.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Mobile, Alabama, on December 11, 2011, the defendants raised the issue of fees and costs by claiming that, because they had never previously applied for an adult bookstore license under successfully-challenged licensing regulations, they were entitled to a reasonable hourly fee for attorney's work in obtaining the relief afforded by the court.  In fact, the court found that, contrary to these claims, defendants had not sought an interim fee for their work on the case as a whole, and the court had not yet issued an order requiring the defendants to comply with the requirements of Section 5 of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,919,098.00, $69,106.36 in costs, and a civil penalty of $15,625.50. The court also granted the parties a temporary restraining order preventing them from further raising the issue, barring them from participating in any future litigation, and ordering them to submit an application for an injunction against future violations of the anti-fraud provisions.  On March 16, 2015 the court entered an order granting the defendants relief on the basis of a technical victory on a related administrative proceeding, which required all in-town and out-of-town registrants to complete travel permit applications with two separate law-enforcement jurisdictions before proceeding with a fee award.  As set forth in the order, the relief granted to the defendants is based largely on the technical victory, and is not so minimal as to render any fee award unreasonable.
