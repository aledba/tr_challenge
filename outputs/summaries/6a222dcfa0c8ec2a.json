  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Commissioner of Social Security for denying a claimant's request for two-week extensions.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, N.Y., alleges that, on June 30, 2015, the Commission of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (DOH) issued an unfavorable finding in favor of the claimant.  According to the complaint, Dr. Ransom's opinion, which was consistent with the Commission's finding, was inconsistent with the evidence presented in the record.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Commission improperly relied on the opinion of a consultative examiner who evaluated the claimant on multiple occasions, and failed to adequately assess the severity of her condition.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission&rsquo;s complaint, the Court held that, as a result of this conduct, Plaintiff failed to meet her duty to develop the record and to make a reasonable determination of whether a claimant is disabled or unable to work.  As a result, Plaintiff was not able to perform any work related to her disability.  On October 11, 2017, the ALJ issued a judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the Commission to conduct a credibility inquiry.  To learn more about how to spot signs of impairment, see Litigation Release No. 5180304, April 19, 2018.  For further information, see Judgment No. 17-cv-6188 (Dkt. 8-1) (N.Y. 2018).  The Commission has also issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent evaluation of a claimant before making a determination on whether or not a person is disabled.  Among other things, the SEC's order requires the Commission determine whether a person with a history of impairment has a sufficient capacity to perform a full range of work related activities, including providing timely and accurate information about the condition of a person who has been diagnosed with a serious medical condition, such as bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, or substance abuse.  Additionally, the order requires that the Commissioner determine whether the claimant has sufficient functional limitations and restrictions due to his or her disability, and that the complaint should be barred from participating in any work-related activity.  Specifically, it requires the Commissioner to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support a determination based on a reasonable basis.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Ransom, Berryhill, Kelly"
