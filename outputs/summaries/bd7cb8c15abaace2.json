  "summary": "On July 5, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against William D. Corrigan, Jr., a former president and chief executive officer of Embedded Control Systems, Inc., a company that developed a process for replacing copper wiring in airplanes with fiber optics.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Corrigan solicited investments in ECS, Inc. based on false statements about the need for investor funds and what those funds would be used for.  The complaint alleges that Corrigan made material misrepresentations about the nature of the investments, including that the funds were needed to cover health insurance costs, and that the money was being used to pay for personal expenses.  Corrigan also allegedly told investors that he would do one thing but did another, that if he was unable to raise the required revenue before the end of March 2009, its health insurer would cancel its policy; and that if Neilitz and Rawah Partners, respectively, were not interested he would have to solicit funds from other investors.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Corrigan.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the SEC consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Corrigan from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Corrigan to pay $110,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On August 2, 2019, the court granted Corrigan's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws and ordered him to pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $111,000, which is equal to the restitution ordered by the court.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Arizona Secretary of State's Office."
