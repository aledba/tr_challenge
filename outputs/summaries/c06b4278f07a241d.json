  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against Ruben Gonzalez, Jr., a former husband and father of two who were also charged in a separate criminal case.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on April 24, 2014, Gonzalez entered the master bathroom of a home where he shared with his estranged wife, who was her estranged husband.  According to the complaint, the victim confronted Gonzalez about his conduct and asked him to repeat parts of what he had told her in his pre-trial interview.  As alleged, Gonzalez replied that he did not expect the victim to testify as he did, and instead put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger.  After a jury trial, the court found that Gonzalez was ineffective in failing to object to the out-of-court statements made to him by the victim and her sons, and that he had failed to apply the rule of lenity in sentencing him on counts 1, criminal attempt to commit a felony, rather than on Count 2, aggravated assault, denying his rights to due process and not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment as guaranteed by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Gonzalez consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Ga. today announced criminal charges against Gonzalez arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On May 2, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Gonzalez, charging him with violations of Section 16(a)(1) and 17(b)(2) of The Securities Act and Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-2, and 14a-13 thereunder.  It also charged Gonzalez with aiding and abetting the commission of a felony and with violating Section 15(a).  The complaint also charges Gonzalez with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Georgia's Criminal Justice Act and Rules 206(3) and 206 (4)-8 thereunder and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-officer bar against Gonzalez from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, offer, or sale of any security"
