  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of two felony counts of attempted murder in the second degree and, by extension, criminal possession of a firearm in the first degree.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, on August 11, 2013, a New York City officer and two New York Police Department officers confronted a group of teenagers on a public street in the Bronx and fired a single gunshot at them.  The officers' testimony supported the officer's contention that, in preparing to testify in an unrelated federal criminal proceeding, defendant raised the gun to eye level, fire the gun, and drop the gun.  As alleged in the complaint, the officers' statements, which were corroborated by testimony from the officers, were not tested for fingerprints or for DNA evidence.  In addition, the complaint alleges that one of the officers initially chased defendant on foot but lost sight of the other officer.  At trial, the court found that the officers had a clear, well-lit view of defendant at the time of the shooting, and that the officer had not been immediately forthright with the federal prosecutor when confronted by the officers.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,078.95 plus prejudgment interest of $2,077.95, a civil penalty of $100,000, and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge of the Southern Division of New Jersey granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, barring them from cross-examination, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against each of them. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Birkenheier. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey State Attorney General's Office, and the U.N. Secret Service."
