  "summary": "On January 21, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Walter James Henrich, a former machine operator-pipe bender and a convicted felon, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Henrich.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Henrich alleges that he was unable to perform any work related to his condition and had no useful ability to function in the areas of punctuality, working with others, dealing with stress, or following directions.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Henrich had a history of substance abuse and had tried unsuccessfully to quit.  Henrich also allegedly suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the Commission's Rules of Practice, and orders Henrich to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.
