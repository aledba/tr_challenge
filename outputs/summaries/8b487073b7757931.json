  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the City of San Francisco in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, alleges that, in February 2017, the federal government rescinded guidance documents that it obtained from the Department of Justice relating to the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the rescission of the guidance documents posed a risk to the city's ability to comply with the federal action.  According to the complaint, the SEC's rescission did not cause any harm to the City's concrete interests. Rather, the complaint alleges that it was reasonably probable that the city would face an increased risk of enforcement actions because of the increased foreclosures.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the city consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent review of its policies and procedures.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered an order imposing a temporary restraining order against the city from further violations of the federal laws. The order also ordered the city to provide a detailed, fifteen-page analysis of the proposed rules and to ensure that it does not violate any of the above-mentioned provisions. The court also issued an Order suspending the issuance of an order suspending the issuing of an Order prohibiting the issuance, purchase, or sale of any security-related documents, including the right to reapply as an officer or director of a public agency. The Court's order also prohibits the issuance or issuance of any other emergency relief, including an officer-and-director bar, without requiring a reasonable explanation as to why the city has not complied with the proposed rule or how to proceed with the enforcement action. The Order also orders the City to provide an accounting of the costs and benefits of each proposed rule and to provide the necessary information to determine whether it has sufficient standing to challenge the agency's enforcement actions.  Finally, the court granted the City request for an emergency court order halting the issuance and issuance of the Order.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
