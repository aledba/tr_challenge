  "summary": "On January 21, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a preliminary injunction against a proposed executive order that would bar the United States from resettling refugees from around the world.  The court's order, which is subject to court approval, imposes a temporary restraining order, prohibits the issuance of any final judgment, and orders the issuance and resettlement of emergency relief.  In its order, the court also ordered the issuance, issuance, and resumption of the emergency relief ordered by President Donald J. Trump on September 26, 2018, of the Refugee Act of 1980.  According to the order, as set forth in the Order, states and local governments have the power to grant or withhold the right to resettle refugees in their jurisdictions. The order also prohibits the issuing of any emergency relief order, including, without limitation, emergency relief, such as an asset freeze, an expedited repatriation of Syrian refugees, and an emergency court order to repatriate Syrian refugees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Executive Order, Defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court granted the court's motion for preliminary injunction, which was entered without prejudice by the court on January 13, 2020.  On February 13, 2019, the Court granted the Court's order against the defendants, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The Court also granted the SEC's request for an emergency injunction against future violations of Section 1522(a)(2)(A) and Rule 1522-3 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Anastasia B. Brown and Todd A. Scarlato. The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban. The Office of Refugee and Immigrant Affairs has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people applying to be resettled by using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom's Home Office, the United Nations Office of Refugees, and the British Columbia Office of International Affairs in this matter."
