  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered final judgments against Shari Renee Bishop and David Michael Craig in a child custody case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, alleges that Shari and David were homeschooled by Shari's father, Jerry, who was a convicted felon and registered sex offender.  According to the complaint, Shari told David that she was being stalked and attacked by \"sex offenders, devil worshipers, demons, juggalos, and people eaters.\"  The complaint further alleges that David told Shari that he was going to homeschool Dexter because he was \"somewhat young to use some of the words he was using.\"  Shari also allegedly told him that David was a Satanist.  David allegedly told her that he had a \"horrible track record\" for homeschooling his children.  He also allegedly claimed that his mother hid Dexter from him and hid him from her when she was in a relationship with Jerry.  In addition, David allegedly used Adderall to hide Dexter from Shari, which he later learned was a form of satanic ritual abuse.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, David and Shari violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rules 10b2-1 and (4) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, David has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $150,000.  On a related administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted an investigation that was conducted by David's wife, Rhonda Bishop, and David's mother, Eliana C. Craig, with the assistance of the Office of Family Education and Advocacy (OIEA).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the OIEA's Home and School Task Force.   The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. C.D. Craig. \u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages the public to check the backgrounds of people who commit crimes by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Advocacy and Education has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Adviser Alert to encourage people to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them\u00c2\u00a0an investment in a business."
