  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jeffery S. Redding, a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for multiple counts of rape and aggravated indecent liberties with a child based on allegations that he sexually abused his 4-year-old daughter and his girlfriend.  The court found that Redding violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he was entitled to the appointment of counsel based on substantial and compelling reasons, including his lack of criminal history, his family support, and his having spared the victims from having to testify at a trial.  According to the court's order, Redding filed a motion for a departure from the mandatory on-grid sentences under Jessica's Law in 2010 and 2011. The court ultimately imposed a 155-month sentence for each of the charges, for an aggregated sentence of 210 months, or 17.5 years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Redding.  Redding's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges Redding with violating the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Redding from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The judgment also orders Redding to pay disgorgement of $2,500, plus prejudgment interest of $100,000 and a $1.5 million civil penalty.  On August 28, 2015, the district court entered a journal entry memorandum of decision in which it considered whether relief was appropriate under the terms of the proposed settlement.  At sentencing, the judge imposed the jointly recommended total sentence of210 months' imprisonment, which Redding agreed to, but quickly withdrew it because he did not believe he had the right to an appointed counsel when he received a response from the State's attorney.  As set forth in the court order, redding's motion to appoint counsel for a 60-1507 motion was illegal because, as set forth, he had waived his due process rights by signing and submitting a written response to the state's response, which was not followed by proper statutory procedures for imposing a sentence.  After finding that the subsequent change in law did not fit within the narrow definition of an illegal sentence, this court denied the motion to correct"
