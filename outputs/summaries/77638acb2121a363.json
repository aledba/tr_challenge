  "summary": "On September 12, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant who, according to the court's order, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that Fernando I., of Greenwich, Connecticut, violated Section 46b-15 of the Exchange Act by sending a series of threatening e-mails to his ex-wife, Krystyna W. v. Janusz W., in which the defendant stated that he had subjected the plaintiff to a recent pattern of threatening, and that he was \"manifesting his longing for justice within the legal system for himself and his children.\"  The complaint further alleges that, in the last few months and weeks, the defendant had been arrested twice, once for domestic abuse and once for death threats, and the court erroneously ordered him to stay 100 yards away from the plaintiff.  According to the complaint, the defendants continued to threaten the plaintiff, telling her that she had to \"carried her burden of proof\" to support her request for an order of protection.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant repeatedly told the plaintiff that he would \"pay for everything\" if she \"had a positive response from me.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Fernando I. consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On September 13, 2018, the court granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order against him, which is subject to court approval, ordering him to comply with the court order, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against him.  At the hearing, the SEC also issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, barring him from associating with any third party, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of an investment in a company that does not already exist.  It also ordered the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $5,000 and $1,500, respectively.   The court also ordered Fernando I to comply"
