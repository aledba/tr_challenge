  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Time Warner Cable, Inc., a now-defunct Missouri-based telecommunications company, and three former TWC supervisors for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson County, Missouri, on May 16, 2016, TWC filed a motion to compel arbitration of claims brought by Greer Cooper-Dorsey, a former employee of TWC, alleging that, in violation of Section 5 of the federal securities laws, she failed to adequately demonstrate that she had signed a delegation provision that required questions of arbitrability to be submitted to an arbitrator.  The complaint further alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, the delegation provision was unconscionable and unenforceable.  In its judgment, the court found that TWC had the burden of proving the existence of a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement, without which it would be liable to a single arbitrator, and that it had the authority to determine jurisdiction and arbitability issues as a preliminary matter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Time Warner agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC also agreed to a preliminary injunction, which requires the parties to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court.  To learn more about arbitration, see Litigation Release No. 531 S.W.3d 339 (Mo. banc 2006).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
