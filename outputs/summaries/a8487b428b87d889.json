According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 18, 2017, in the United States District Court in the Southern District of New York, deWitt consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $5,000.00. The judgment also imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar and a 10-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged conduct.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Kowalski of the Chicago Regional Office. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan State Police, and the Michigan Department of Justice in this matter."
