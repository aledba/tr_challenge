  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against Alexander Cohen and his law firm for defrauding a client out of $120,000.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Cohen and the firm violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Cohen violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rule 206(3) and (4) thereunder. The complaint further alleges that the complaint was filed by Nahid Lahiji, her daughter, and her law firm, Abir Cohen Treyzon Salo, LLP (the firm). The complaint alleges that Arta Lahiji replied to the complaint by stating that she had hired Cohen to handle her \"home insurance claim\" and had used a law student \u201ccase manager\u201d to negotiate with the insurer, and had posted the various reviews on the firm\u2019s Facebook page.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Nahid had \"routinely masqueraded as her mother in email and other online communications,\u201d and thus must have authored all of the reviews underlying the defamation claim.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this is not supported by the evidence presented by the complaint. The SEC alleges that, contrary to what the complaint alleges, Nahid and her firm did not violate the securities laws as required by the federal securities laws, and the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Cohen has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities law, and orders him to pay a $36,855 civil penalty and a $24,265 officer and director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Cohen has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions, ordering him to comply with the court's order, and imposing a $32,000 civil penalty, and requiring him to provide a copy of the complaint to the SEC.  On November 21, 2017, an \"anonymous\" user posted a review of the firm and Cohen on Avvo, an online lawyer directory. Cohen has also agreed to a $25,000 officer-and-director bar and to a penny-per-share bar. Cohen"
