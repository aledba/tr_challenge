  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a California-based nursing licensing board for denying a license to a registered nurse based on three of her convictions.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, California, on July 1, 2020, the Board of Registered Nurses (BRC) issued a temporary restraining order against Radwa Mohamed Moustafa, a licensed nurse, for failing to cooperate with the Board in granting her a license.  The SEC alleges that, in September 2015, the BRC issued an order requiring BRC to apply for a license for a nursing license based on a single dismissed conviction.  In its order, the court found that the Board could not deny a license based solely on the conduct underlying the dismissed convictions, and that it had the authority to impose discipline based on that conduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Board's order, however, the board has agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the Board to pay a civil penalty of $65,000.  On August 2, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in the District of Columbia, alleging that BRC violated Sections 480(a)(1) and 480(c) and that the Commission violated Section 17500 of the federal securities laws.  BRC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  A hearing is scheduled for September 24, 2020.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 549 (2014).  The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Health and Human Services, and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
