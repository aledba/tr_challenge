  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Matthew Matson and his company SDRE Group, LLC, purchased a deed of trust at a nonjudicial foreclosure sale in 2007, securing a Small Business Administration loan in the original amount of $475,000. The complaint alleges that Matson, relying on a software application called PropertyRadar, believed that the deed was in first position on the property and therefore that it was in prime position to sell at an advertised price. However, according to the complaint, Matson did not read the deed and did not check the title of the deed. Instead, he signed declarations under penalty of perjury stating that the lien was in second position, with a much lower fair market value than the price paid. Matson then attempted to stop payment on the cashier's checks the next day, realizing that the bank had paid all three of the checks to Matson. The SEC alleges that, in a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Matson arising out of the same conduct.  In a parallel criminal action brought by the SEC, the SEC today announced that it has obtained a court order freezing Matson's assets and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $1,500. The court also issued an order suspending Matson from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay civil penalties of $500,000, and orders Matson to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $100,000 each. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Matson has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Los Angeles Office of Financial Regulation, and the California Office of Insurance Regulation in this matter."
