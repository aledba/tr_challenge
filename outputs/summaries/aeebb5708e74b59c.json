  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against three New York counties for failing to timely respond to overburden reimbursement claims submitted by the counties.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, on April 1, 2012, the New York State Department of Health (DOH) and Department of Human Services (DOH) issued an order requiring the counties to submit reimbursement claims for pre-2006 expenses.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the counties were not entitled to a fixed, non-reducible maximum reimbursement for pre\u20132006 expenses, and the state was obligated to pay the claims.  In addition, the SEC alleges that the counties failed to comply with the requirements of the federal and state laws, including Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and that they were not required to respond to requests for reimbursement before the date of the Commission's decision.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, DOH and DOH have agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and orders them to pay any additional amount in the amount of their claims. The final judgment also prohibits the counties from violating the federal, state, and local reporting requirements of Section 5. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica.
