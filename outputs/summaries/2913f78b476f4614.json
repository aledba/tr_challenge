  "summary": "On June 20, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against Dr. Richard Link, M.D., a Texas-based urologist, for his role in a healthcare liability claim brought by a patient who was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in her left adrenal gland.  The court found that Dr. Link was not qualified to provide an opinion on causation, as required under Section 74 of the civil practice and remedies code.  According to the court's order, Link provided a fair summary of his opinions regarding the alleged breaches in the standard of care and the injuries to Gomez that he caused.  In its order, the court also found that Link failed to adequately describe the causes of Gomez's injury and failed to provide reasonable and prudent advice regarding whether Dr. Acharya exercised care in his treatment of Gomez.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the judgment, Link consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 74, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains with respect to the alleged injunctive relief.    The judgment also orders Link to pay a $1,500 civil penalty, a $100,000 civil penalty and a $500,000 penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The court also ordered Link to comply with a court order requiring him to provide a \"fair summary\" of his opinion regarding the nature of the alleged violations in the sub-reporting of his findings to the trial court.\u00c2\u00a0   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Link.
