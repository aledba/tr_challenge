  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against a Swiss company and a British Virgin Islands company for defrauding investors in oil-related transactions.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that in spring 2016, Arman and Lawrence Kayablian approached Gunvor about a possible business relationship involving sales of Iraqi fuel oil. According to the complaint, the Kayablians sought out Gunvor as a financing partner to provide upfront capital and logistical support to purchase the fuel oil in volume and resell it on the international market. The complaint alleges that Gunvor and Nemsss agreed to enter into a series of one-off contracts that provided for the purchase and sale of fuel oil at the below-market domestic price from the Iraqi Oil Tankers Corporation, a state-owned oil company. But the defendants ultimately declined to form a joint venture and instead chose to enter \"a series of\u00c2\u00a0one-off\u00c2\u00a0joint ventures\u00c2\u00a0that mimicked the structure of a [joint venture] without the formality.\" The complaint further alleges that the defendants' intent \"to recover damages suffered as a result of Defendants' fraudulent conduct in connection with purported fuel oil contracts\" was to make the payments required by the contracts but did not receive the benefit of its bargain. The court also found that, in the absence of federal litigation or indemnification actions, the defendants did not have the capacity and expertise to fulfill their obligations under the contracts.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Virginia today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants agreed to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgments also order the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. The settlements are subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FINCA) and the U.K. Citizenship and Immigration Services (CISSA) in this matter."
