  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to disclose to the court that they had obtained a search warrant for the home of a member of the Fraternal Order of Police and that the search warrant was invalid.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in the course of conducting the search, the deputies failed to detect any evidence of any criminal activity.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on April 20, 2012, the jury found that the deputies violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act by not executing the warrant.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from violating the securities laws, and issued a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-2 thereunder, ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $1,000 each, and ordering the destruction of any evidence.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, charging the defendants with violating Section 5 and Rule 13a-1 thereunder and with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-11.  Separately, the U. S. Attorney\u2018s Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced parallel criminal charges against the three defendants.

Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigation, Criminal Investigations, and the Office of the Chief of"
