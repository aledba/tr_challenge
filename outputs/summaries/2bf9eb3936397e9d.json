  "summary": "On May 9, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment against a defendant in a case brought by the SEC against her.  The SEC's complaint alleges that from approximately February 18, 2017 through March 7, 2017, Carolina Del Carmen Roldan, a Los Angeles resident, threatened to release to the media personally damaging photos and videos of Ivan Gabriel Aguilera, the son of the famous, now-deceased Mexican singer Juan Gabriel.  According to the complaint, Gomez, who lives in Miami, made the threat through text messages and recorded calls to Aguileras, telling him that she would return to Miami a second time only if he paid for her flight and guaranteed payment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Gomez.  On March 6, Gomez consented to a search of her cell phone, which revealed substantial evidence of her knowing facilitation of the extortionate plot.  Gomez also agreed to be interviewed by the FBI, which recorded additional communications.  After the FBI interviewed Gomez, the SEC filed an emergency action charging her with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Gomez agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $50,000, and bars her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities for a period of five years.  She also agreed not to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of the alleged extortion scheme, which was conducted in the Office of Compliance and Regulation by the Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit, with the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper."
