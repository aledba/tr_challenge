  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on December 12, 2017, entered a final judgment against a former fire marshal for his role in a double jeopardy case.  The court found that the defendant, Shelly Arndt, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle on Dec. 12, 2015, filed on December 13, 2015 and unsealed on December 14, 2016, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order, freezing Arndts' assets, and barring her from appearing before the court as an expert witness.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against her for her role in an earlier double-jail arson case in which she was charged with arson and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The court also granted the defendant the right to reapply for a hearing in the future on the same day.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Seattle Police Department, the Kitsap County Fire Department, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
