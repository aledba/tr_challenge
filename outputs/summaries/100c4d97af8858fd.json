  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a New Orleans man accused of orchestrating a string of string of sexual assaults.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on January 31, 1990, Tyrone Warner, a resident of St. Thomas Housing Development, NOPD, Louisiana, was falsely convicted of two counts of aggravated kidnapping and one count of attempted rape.  According to the complaint, Warner was falsely told that he had a prior relationship with a man who had been convicted of the same crimes.  In reality, the complaint alleges, Warner had no such relationship with the man, and had engaged in consensual oral sex with the victim.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant was not the only one who was convicted of these crimes and was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or a post-conviction release.  Additionally, the SEC alleges that Warner was the only defendant who was ever convicted of a felony for committing such a crime, and that he did not know the man or the woman behind the alleged crime.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Warner consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $'57,387.00, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On March 15, 2018, the Louisiana Court of Appeals denied Defendant's motion for a new trial, finding him liable for a total of $1,500,000 in pre-judgment interest and a $100,000 civil penalty, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interests, and to pay civil penalties of $\"287.00 and $\"851.00.\"  The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Warner from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.    In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana today entered final judgments against Warner, ordering the imposition of a civil injunctive relief order against him and ordering the issuance of an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the\u00c2\u00c2"
