  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Colorado man who was convicted of felony menacing and attempted first degree assault.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, alleges that, on January 27, 2017, Raymond M. Procasky, a resident of Colorado Springs, attempted to elude police officers by driving two blocks to a school parking lot and stopping there at the officers\u2019 direction. The complaint alleges that the officers followed the car, which was then followed by another car, and followed the vehicle until the officers stopped the car at the end of the parking lot. According to the complaint, the officers did not see any spent shell casings in the car. Instead, the complaint alleges, the officer continued to follow the car and the defendant continued to drive. The SEC also alleges that Procaskay failed to comply with a court order requiring him to merge his prior felony convictions for attempted first- and second-degree assault with his prior criminal convictions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Colorado today announced that it filed criminal charges against the defendant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The judgment also orders Procaski to pay disgorgement of $2,655, which is equal to the amount of his pre- and post-judgment interest in the case. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2019, the court entered a temporary restraining order and entered a conduct-based injunction. The court also issued an order suspending Procaskiy from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The order also prohibits Procaskys from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of incarceration. The judge granted the SEC\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the anti-fraud provisions. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley, Chief of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans."
