  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama yesterday entered a final judgment against Nathan Lee Boyd, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the 1999 murder of Joseph Danny Sledge.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that, on March 12, 1999, Boyd and his brother, Gary Bowlin, went to The Galley, a Florence, Alabama restaurant, and were confronted by Sledge's father, who had recently been incarcerated for drug and alcohol-related offenses. According to the complaint, Sledge was a \"typical\" child who \"was capable of being a responsible adult and in the service of others.\" The complaint further alleges that Boyd had been raised by his father and his mother, and that his mother had been abused by her father. The complaint alleges that when Boyd was a child, his father had kicked him out of the home and told him to \"get out of there and do something stupid,\" and that he had attempted to steal a gun from his brother. The SEC alleges that the court failed to appropriately consider, as a mitigating factor, Boyd's past exposure to violence and his apparent inability to appreciate the value of a \"score settling\" in a criminal case.  In its judgment, the court found that Boyd violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also ordered Boyd to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $100,000 civil penalty.  Boyd also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years and to a five-year officer-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Boyd consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $5,000 in restitution. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 29, 2016, the U. S. District Judge in Birmingham granted Boyd's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, including securities in the securities of any public company. The order also prohibits Boyd from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from practicing or practicing any financial instrument. The final judgment orders Boyd to comply with the court's order."
