  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Arthur Bronstein, a New York State Level 2 certified fire investigator, for his role in a 2015 fire that claimed the life of a dryer.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, Bronstein was an expert in dryer fire detection and testing, and testified that he had observed evidence of electrical arcing in the subject dryer at the time the fire occurred.  The complaint alleges that Bronstein's testimony, which was corroborated by his own testimony, was insufficient to establish the existence and nature of the alleged fire.  In addition, the SEC alleges that he failed to provide any expert opinion concerning the cause of the fire, whether caused by a design defect or failure to warn, or the safety of the dryer's internal wiring and heating components.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $261,266.00, prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil penalty of $250,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Eric R. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Cohen and Ms. Karpel of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
