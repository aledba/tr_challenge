  "summary": "On November 9, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Darnell Bryant Bey, a 19-year-old Ohio resident who was convicted of felony murder with a gun specification, and sentenced him to a mandatory term of 18 years to life in prison.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, Bey was indicted on June 11, 2017 on two counts of aggravated robbery.  The SEC alleges that, on the day of the alleged murder, the defendant, Omar Sykes, and Antonio Scott, both of whom were unknown to A.J. Barrett, allegedly shot and killed the victim in the street next to Sherman Elementary School.  As alleged in the complaint, Sykes and Scott were the last of the victims to run across the street and hide from the victim.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Bey arising from the same conduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Bey from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Bey has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and imposing a $10,000 civil penalty against Barrett.  Barrett has also agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $960, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the court.  On December 5, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the Ohio Court of Common Pleas issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering Bey to comply with the court's order by the date of his sentencing.  Judge Burt also ordered that Bey pay $2,500 in restitution, which is equal to the amount he has already agreed to pay in the criminal case.  A hearing on December 13, 2018 was scheduled for 11:30 a.m."
