  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a former prison warden for his role in an April 2015 attack on another inmate.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Licking, Missouri, alleges that Deputy Warden Roger Terry acted with deliberate indifference to the substantial risk that a fellow inmate would be attacked by fellow inmates.  According to the complaint, Terry told the inmate that he was going to leave him in Ad-Seg until he could \"figure out what to do with\" him because he was too aggressive to be placed in the protective custody unit.  As alleged, however, he did not request protective custody because he believed there was a substantial risk of serious harm to Blair.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Terry had not yet interviewed his attacker or completed the investigation of the first attack at the time Terry approved his return to general population.  On May 27, 2015, Terry interviewed Blair as part of the investigation into the April 7 attack. The interview was recorded and played for the jury. The jury found Terry liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Terry consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Terry also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of his pay in the criminal case.  After the settlement was entered, Terry agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for May 24, 2017.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 17-cv-8221 (April 7, 2015).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Corrections, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri State Department of Health and Human Services."
