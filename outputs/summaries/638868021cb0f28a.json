  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered final judgments against a California company and its owner in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Tracy, California, alleges that the California company, Arnaudo Brothers, L.P., failed to comply with a court order requiring it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty equal to the amount of its profits.  According to the complaint, the company also failed to disclose to the court that it had terminated negotiations with a member of the union in the early 1980's.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in the days leading up to the termination of negotiations, the union's representative repeatedly told the company that he had \"no problems with unions\" and that he \"had just come by to tell me that he enjoyed working with me, and he probably wouldn't see me again.\"  The complaint further alleges that, in the late 1980's, the Union's representative asked the union to withdraw its offer to participate in a collective bargaining agreement.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order, the employer consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the company to pay a civil monetary penalty of $10,000.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 9, 2015, the administrative law judge granted the company's request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 1160.3 of the federal securities laws, ordering that the company pay a $20,000 civil penalty, and imposing an officer-and-director bar on the company.   The settlement is pending approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the San Diego Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
