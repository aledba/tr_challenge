  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Ebelenwa Chikere, a former home health care agency employee charged with fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Chikesre provided improper overview testimony, improper testimony about how Medicare works and common fraudulent schemes she has seen in her investigations.  According to the complaint, as alleged in the SEC's opinion, the government misrepresented to the jury how Medicare worked and how clinics typically operate.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the government offered impermissible overview testimony to show that the patient was eligible for home health services.  As alleged, however, none of the patients identified at trial ever saw a doctor, and the government paid the patients for their information.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's judgment, Chikese consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $258,738 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his civil monetary penalty.  Chikee also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, other than to provide a copy of the company\u2019s policies and procedures.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Office of the United States Attorney for New York and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)."
