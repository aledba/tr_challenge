  "summary": "On October 26, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action against F-Squared Investments, Inc., a Wellesley-based registered investment adviser, alleging that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, alleges that, from at least October 2008 through September 2013, the SEC issued an order requiring disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest in the amount of $30 million that was paid to the SEC in administrative proceedings.  According to the complaint, the order did not apply to all of the claims raised in the complaint.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the SEC failed to disclose to the court that it had obtained a temporary restraining order requiring the SEC to disgorge its alleged profits in a civil enforcement proceeding.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the trustee has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the SEC from violating these provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount that it has agreed to pay to the relief fund.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (2014).  The complaint also names as a relief fund defendant a provision in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 that requires SEC relief from violations of the federal securities laws, and requires the trustee to submit a written complaint to the Court of Appeals for the purpose of obtaining an accounting of the alleged profits obtained by the SEC.

Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Scott A. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
