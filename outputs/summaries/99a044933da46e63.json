  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Tremayne James for loitering and prowling at night.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that James violated the antifraud provisions of the federal anti-loitering laws.  According to the complaint, James was initially sentenced to sixty days of probation, but was later ordered to pay a total of 105 months in prison.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office today announced that it has obtained a final judgment that permanently enjoins James from future violations of the anti-litering provisions of Section 5 of the Pennsylvania Department of Justice, and orders him to pay an additional $1,000 in restitution.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, that James did not commit any such conduct.  Instead, the complaint alleges that he engaged in a pattern of misconduct that led to the addition of the two points to James\u2019s criminal-history score.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, James consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions, ordering him to be barred from serving any prison term, and imposing a civil penalty of up to one year.  James agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a five-year officer-and-director bar prohibiting him from associating with any person who has committed or engaged in any type of unlawful conduct with the institution of his or her law.  He also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a state or federal agency, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest in the amount of his and her family's future legal fees.  Finally, the court agreed to the imposition of a six-year prison sentence, which is subject to court approval.  On June 29, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against James, charging him with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting James's violations of Section 4A1.2(c)(2).  The complaint charges James with violating Section 5, and seeks permanent injunctions against further violations of Sections 5 and 5, as well as civil penalties against him.
