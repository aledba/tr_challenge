  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Joe Michael Luna, Jr., a San Antonio, Texas man convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death for his role in the death of Michael Andrade.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Texas, Luna, who was a premed student at St. Mary\u2019s in San Antonio at the time of the alleged crime, used a crawl space connected to the apartment to sneak into the apartment and steal a car. The complaint alleges that the defendant knew of and was willing to testify about the abuse Andrade suffered as a child, and that a thorough examination of his psychological state would have revealed that he suffers from a variety of mental health problems.  The complaint further alleges that Luna was unable to convince the trial judge that he could impose the death penalty on a jury without cause.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Luna, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction against Luna from future violations of the federal securities laws.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Advocacy and Public Education by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Department of Criminal Appeals, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Office of Inspector General in this matter."
