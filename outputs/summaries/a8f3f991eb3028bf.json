  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of the Florida Attorney General's Office's motion for a temporary restraining order against Timothy Anderson, who was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon after he drove his truck erratically and struck his girlfriend's car.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, Anderson was charged in August 2016 with aggravated battery with a motor vehicle.  The complaint alleges that Anderson engaged in a pattern of reckless driving in which he used an automobile to commit an aggravated assault and then used a vehicle to commit the additional, lesser-included offense of aggravated battery.  As alleged in the complaint, Anderson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Anderson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and requires him to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central Florida Division of Criminal Justice today announced criminal charges against Anderson.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the search tool.  For example, the SEC previously charged a Florida man with reckless driving based on information he provided to a trial court.  On August 2, 2018, the court issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent investigation into whether a defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on the lesser, separate offense of attempted murder by shooting. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Miami Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Florida Department of Insurance, and the Florida Office of the Attorney General in this matter."
