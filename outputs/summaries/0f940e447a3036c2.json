  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maine today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of two felony counts of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in York County, New York, alleges that on December 12, 2008, Peter L. Robbins, then age thirty-two, touched the then-twelve-year-old victim's genitals over her clothing and made her touch his genitals over his clothing while the victim was spending the night with Robbins's niece. The complaint further alleges that Robbins, confronted by a prosecutor stating as fact that he had committed the crime for which he was on probation, told the victim that he did not drink excessively; he had known who I am for a long time, and he knows I come from a good family. The court ruled that Robbins could not, as a matter of law, refresh the victim's recollection with another person's statement because the prosecutor was derelict in countenancing it, even absent the defendant's timely assistance in detecting it. The judgment also permanently enjoins Robbins from participating in the jury selection process for a future trial, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Robbins. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice in this matter."
