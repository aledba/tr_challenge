  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the Board of Equalization (BOE) in a related administrative proceeding.  According to the court's order, on January 1, 2005, the Board issued an order requiring the BOE to determine where and how to allocate the sales tax revenue generated by the sale of personal property to retail customers.  The order also required that the Board consider whether it had sufficient evidence to determine whether a specific entity had the right to transfer title to a specific customer.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Medline Industries, Inc., a privately-held Illinois company, and its former CEO, Eric Gerstein, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the Board's findings, the court also ordered the Board to conduct an independent review of the books, records, and records of all of these transactions, including those of Medline Holdings, Medline Industries Holdings, and MedCal Sales, LLC.   The Board's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins the Board from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to conduct a conduct-based review of its books and records, including that of its compliance officer. \u00c2\u00a0The Board's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Eric Wadley, Ms. Welshhans, and Mr. Wadley.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 16, 2013).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to quickly spot any signs of fraud or other suspicious activity.  Investor Alerts should be used to identify suspicious patterns of fraud, such as:    Investors should check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool to identify whether their investments are subject to\u00c2\u00a0clear and reasonable scrutiny."
