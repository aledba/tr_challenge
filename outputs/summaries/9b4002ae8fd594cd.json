  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Gabriel Alarcon Velazquez, a Mexican citizen who was appointed receiver by a Curacao court for the benefit of all of his siblings.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that Gabriel, as the oldest sibling in the family, set up two corporations, Zalinco Corporation, N.V. and Ocana Corporation, for the purposes of the siblings' benefit. The complaint alleges that in 1981, Gabriel and his sister, Araceli, created the two corporations for their benefit. According to the complaint, Gabriel allegedly used the corporations' assets to make personal investments in Houston real estate and in a Houston day-trading operation, and to pay personal expenses related to his yacht, the purchase of a vacation home, and a condominium in New York. The SEC alleges that the sisters' fraud-based claims arise out of Gabriel's alleged misstatements regarding his alleged misuse of the companies' assets and his failure to disclose his alleged misdeeds. In addition, the SEC alleges in its complaint that Gabriel violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Gabriel consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $6,078 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and orders him pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Financial Regulation today announced that it has issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the securities laws of other countries. The investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Banking and Securities, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
