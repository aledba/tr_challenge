  "summary": "On September 26, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against the agency that terminated the parental rights of two of the children, G.P. and A.P., in violation of the federal and state child custody laws.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Chula Vista, California, on September 25, 2011 the agency obtained a temporary restraining order and ordered the children to be placed in a safe, secure, and supervised home.  The court found that the children were specifically targeted for adoption because their mother was incarcerated and had a history of substance abuse and drug use.  As alleged in the court order, the children had been removed from their mother's care and placed in out-of-home care when their father was arrested and sentenced to prison for drug and alcohol-related violations.  In addition, the court found the children should be placed with their father and ordered him to participate in a home study that would determine whether to adopt the children.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the agency consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining the agency from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the agency to provide the children with a permanent home and to provide for the children's placement with a licensed licensed foster family.  On August 29, 2012, the Court granted the agency's request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered it to remove the children from the home and place them in a separate, separate, and separate safe place.  After the court granted the request for a temporary asset freeze, the case was transferred to the Division of Children and Family Services, which administers the program.  During the hearing, the judge granted the court a temporary injunction against further violations of the charged provisions, ordered a hearing on the matter, and appointed a receiver to determine the appropriate placement.  Following the hearing on August 30, the SEC issued an order requiring the court to consider the merits of the case against the individual defendants, ordering the release of the remaining defendants, and appointing an attorney to represent them in the case.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Christopher R. Carstens and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Ms. Basinger. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the Internal Affairs Division of the Department of Justice."
