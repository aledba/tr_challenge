  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Utah today entered final judgments in favor of the parties in a settled civil action brought by the court against the defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, Michael Lang and Melanie Madsen Thatcher of Springdale, Utah agreed to settle the case by agreeing to pay $1.8 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their principal and interest payments.  The court also ruled that Buyer was entitled to specific performance and to be entitled to liquidated damages under a theory of \"unjust enrichment.\"  The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to comply with the court\u2019s orders, and that the court improperly granted Buyer the right to proceed with the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney\u2019S Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Buyer.    The SEC\u2018s complaint charges Buyer with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-1 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, civil penalties, and injunctive relief. The SEC also seeks a temporary restraining order and an accounting of the defendants\u2019 alleged violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 17(b)(2)(A) and No. 206 (B.C.&rsquo;17(a)).  The case is being handled by John Rymas of the Salt Lake Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Division of Securities and Exchange Commission, the Utah Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
