  "summary": "On May 25, 2018, the Illinois State Board of Elections (Board) issued a final judgment finding that the Illinois Secretary of State's Office violated the antifraud provisions of Section 9-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the Board's order, filed in federal court in Chicago on May 24, 2019, Cooke, a resident of Chicago, Illinois, filed a complaint with the Board alleging that the Committee for Frank J. Mautino (Committee) violated the federal securities laws by making expenditures to the Bank of America for gas and repairs of personal vehicles.  The Board also found that, contrary to Cooke's claims, the Committee made expenditures to Happy's for gas, repairs, and other expenses unrelated to campaign or governmental duties.  In its order, the Board found that Cooke failed to establish a violation of the charged provisions and imposed a $500,000 civil penalty against him.  On July 10, 2018 the Board issued its final order finding Cooke liable for violating these provisions and ordering him to pay a $225,109.19 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Cooke consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, orders him to disgorge $159,028 in ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $250,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-8-10(a)(9).
