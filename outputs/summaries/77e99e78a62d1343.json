  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil mortgage fraud racketeering case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, alleges that Carlton Barton, Jr. and Darryl E. Pittman, L.P.A., aided and abetted the defendants' violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the complaint, Barton filed a first amended complaint in January 2016 alleging that Barton violated the federal securities laws by refusing to release forfeited funds from two criminal cases to satisfy a civil judgment obtained by the defendants.  Barton's amended complaint alleges that, contrary to these representations, Barton is entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity under Section 2744 of the securities laws.  In addition, Barton alleges that he cooperated with, and assisted in the prosecution of Gofman and Karka, Inc., and that he was entitled to compensation from the forfeited property for assisting the Prosecutor's Office in the criminal cases.  On August 31, 2016, the trial court granted Barton's motion to dismiss, without admitting or denying the Commission's motion, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Barton from future violations of Sections 2923.32(A)(1) and (3) and requires him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $158,520.00, $284,388.33, and $15,861.05, respectively, in the interest of recovering his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and a civil penalty of $160,200.00.  Additionally, the court denied Barton's request to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the public company or by association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.    The Commission's order also prohibits Barton from associating with or practicing with a broker-dealer that does not have the requisite legal expertise to determine whether to issue a civil injunctive relief. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Ohio Office of Inspector General, with assistance from Scott Frost and Eric Werner of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and is being supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Chicago Regional Office. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Ohio Attorney General's Office, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office."
