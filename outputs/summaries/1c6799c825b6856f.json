  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Michael Fonseca and Michael Lewis in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 922(a)(2), the defendants failed to disclose their knowledge of their status as felons when they were in possession of a firearm.  According to the complaint, the defendants were not aware of their prior felony convictions, and the defendants did not have the requisite knowledge to determine whether they had violated the federal securities laws.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants were aware of the defendants\u2019 prior criminal convictions, but did not show that they had been convicted of a felony.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions, ordered them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordered Lewis to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  On January 10, 2016, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to surrender their firearms.  A hearing for the defendants was scheduled for 4:30 p.m. EST on February 13, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 539 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry, Chief of the Miami Regional Office.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of the District Judge and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Miami Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Florida Department of Justice Criminal Division, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the Florida Office of Financial Regulation."
