  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the agency failed to adequately evaluate the safety and efficacy of certain of the chemical substances in its proposed rulemaking.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in 2016, the EPA issued a rule requiring the EPA to evaluate all of the chemicals at issue in a risk evaluation.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the proposed rule did not adequately identify the risks posed to health or the environment by those chemicals, and instead required the agency to consider whether a specific chemical substance posed an unreasonable risk of harm to the health or environment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the SEC has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the agency from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders it to conduct a full risk evaluation of each chemical substance under Section 6(a).  The final judgment also orders the SEC to pay a civil penalty of $25,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  On May 24, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the New York District Court entered a temporary restraining order against the SEC from further violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b2-3 thereunder, and orders the court to consider the merits of the proposed order. The court also granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction against future violations, which the court will determine at a later date.  A hearing scheduled for June 22, 2017 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-2620(b)(4)(A).  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Health and Human Services today announced that it has issued an order suspending the issuance of an emergency court order halting the suspension of the agency's proposed rule and ordering it to provide a copy of the order to the court for further review.   The court's action is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and the Department of"
