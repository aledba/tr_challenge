  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant in a civil contempt case brought by his wife, Victoria C. Thomas.  The court found Husband in contempt of the court's September 16, 2016 order and imposed sanctions in the form of counsel fees and other relief.  According to the Court's order, Husband falsely testified at the September 2016 hearing and knowingly provided an incorrect valuation of the parties' joint TD stock account.  Husband alleges that at the hearing, his counsel unilaterally stipulated to Wife's incorrect valuation, and duped the court into accepting that value.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Husband.  As alleged in the complaint, the court issued a temporary restraining order and ordered Husband to pay $10,000.00 for counsel fees, which he did not do.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in New Jersey, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $25,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $10.00.  On a related administrative proceeding, the Court issued an order suspending Husband from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  It also ordered him to sign an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's receiver.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Philadelphia Regional Office by David Habjan and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Mr. Habjan, Ms. Kasper, and Mr. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
