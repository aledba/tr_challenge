  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Blackrock Realty, Inc., a Texas-based real estate investment firm, and its former owner for defrauding investors out of millions of dollars.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Blackrock violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Blackrock agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Blackrock also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $844,000, which was equal to the amount of the late charge and additional interest charged by Blackrock.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced parallel criminal charges against the defendants.  On November 9, 2014, the court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered the defendants to pay $1.2 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and ordered the parties to pay civil penalties of $500,000 and $1 million, respectively.  As part of the settlement, the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David A. Kasper and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by David Kasper."
