  "summary": "On July 11, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas entered a final judgment against Maria Guadalupe De La Garza Gutierrez Montemayor and Maria Guadagnino De LaGarza Montemaya, finding that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that, contrary to the SEC's findings, the defendants were entitled to leave to amend their complaint and to seek a final determination by the court on the merits of the case. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, Texas, alleges that the defendants violated Section 1503 of the Exchange Act and Rule 15(a) thereunder, and that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the sisters\u2019 claims. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the sisters consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The judgment also prohibits the defendants from seeking a judgment imposing permanent injunctions against future violations of Section 15(b)(1) and Section 17(a)(2) and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 and $20,000, respectively. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney General of Texas today announced criminal charges against the sisters.  The SEC also announced that it would conduct a parallel criminal investigation against the defendants.  In a related matter, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action on May 8, 2018. The complaint charges the defendants with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"). The complaint also charges the sisters with violating Section 5(b). The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violation of Section 5, and seeks a judgment ordering the sisters to comply with the SEC order. The case is being supervised by Chedly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The Commission on International Affairs has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of foreign investment fraud, including the potential for investment fraud in microcap companies. Investors should be aware of Investor Alerts about foreign investment scams targeting microcap issuers."
