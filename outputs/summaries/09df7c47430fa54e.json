  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Great America LLC, doing business as Six Flags Great America and Six Flags Hurricane Harbor, for failing to comply with the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, alleges that Six Flags willfully violated the federal Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACTA) when it issued receipts that included at least the first six digits of their debit card numbers.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to adequately disclose to the cardholder that they had suffered a serious injury or loss in the value of their property when they used their debit cards to make five food purchases at Six Flags, each time receiving an electronically printed receipt that included the first five digits of the card numbers in addition to the last four digits.

The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-454 (January 24, 2019).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant the Illinois Department of Insurance's Office of Inspector General's Cyber Risk Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious patterns of activity, such as whether a credit card issuer has a history of identity theft or payment fraud, as an important factor in determining whether a consumer has standing to bring a claim under the federal law. The complaint further alleges that none of these facts were apparent on the receipt of the receipt, and that defendants did not allege any actual harm or loss of property.
