  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a California man for orchestrating a scheme to defraud Medicare.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least 2013 through at least 2014, Simon Hong, a licensed physical therapist, provided services to patients to treat their pain, and then participated in a health care fraud scheme that generated millions of dollars in kickbacks.  According to the complaint, Hong provided the patients with Medicare-eligibility information, which enabled him to receive kickbacks for providing services that had not been provided in the past.  Hong allegedly used the patient information to make payments to Medicare for physical therapy treatments that were never provided, including massages and acupuncture.  In addition, Hong allegedly provided his patients with fake Medicare provider numbers, which allowed him to submit fraudulent Medicare claims with his patients' identifying information.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hong consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, a $50,000 civil penalty, and a $75,000 officer-and-director bar.  On May 17, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Currid granted Hong's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered him to comply with the court's order, and appointed a receiver to oversee the receiver.  To determine whether Hong is liable for future violations, the court will determine whether to impose a penalty based on the amount of the kickbacks Hong allegedly received.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Hong, charging him with violating Section 13(b)(2) and 13(a)(2).  The court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order requiring Hong to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $100,000.   Hong also agreed to a four-level role enhancement where, for each aggravated identity theft conviction, he was liable for a five-year prison term and a mandatory consecutive 24-month prison term.  Finally, Hong agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in any scheme that constitutes a violation of the anti-kickback statute and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization."
