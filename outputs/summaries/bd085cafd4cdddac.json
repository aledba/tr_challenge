  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered final judgments in favor of St. John Vianney High School, Inc., a public high school located in the City of Kirkwood, Missouri, and its leasehold owner on its baseball field.  According to the SEC's order, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia on September 5, 2018, the court found that the school violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that, in violation of the federal securities laws, the school was not entitled to a fair and equitable treatment of its religious exercise.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against the school.   The SEC's complaint alleges that, from 2012 to 2016, the district court granted the school a partial summary judgment in its motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and that the court improperly granted a partial injunction against further violations of Sections 10(d) and 14(e) of The Exchange Act and Rules 10d-1 and 14e-3 thereunder and denied the school\u2019s request for a summary judgment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  On September 6, 2018 the court granted summary judgment for the school and ordered a hearing on the matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 567 (8th Cir. 2011).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert on Investor.gov to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also check the background of anyone selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether there are any conflicts of interest.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC also issued an investor alert on the dangers of overcharging investors with investments that could be used for personal expenses, such as mortgage payments, credit card bills, and other personal expenses."
