  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Foad Afshar, a defendant who was convicted by a jury of two counts of sexual assault based on his failure to disclose on his juror questionnaires or during jury selection that he had been sexually assaulted as a child. The court also found that, prior to trial, when called for jury service in another sexual assault case involving an alleged victim who was a minor, Juror 6 acknowledged that he could not sit on that jury due to his feelings about his daughter; and, as the trial court observed, there appears to be little in the way of logical explanation for how he could have differentiated between the two cases.  According to the court's order, however, the jury selection was conducted in a \"defensive posture\" and the defendant did not respond dishonestly to the question.  The court concluded that, in giving this response, the defendant had not disclosed to the jury that he was the victim of a sexual assault, but rather the perpetrator of an armed robbery.  Jurors 6 and 14 also allegedly told the court that they had been victims of childhood sexual assault when they were young, and that they did not identify as victims of the crime as they had when confronted by the perpetrator.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Juror 5. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, charges AfShar with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and imposing a conduct-based injunction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and ordering the judge to appoint a new jury. The final judgments also order the defendant to cooperate with the investigation that led to the discovery of potential juror bias, which was conducted by the Office of Professional and Risk Analysis and supervised by the Division of Criminal Justice. The litigation will be led by David A. Kasper and Ms. Karpel of the New Jersey Office."
