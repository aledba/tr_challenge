  "summary": "On October 2, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado entered a final judgment against Vail Summit Resorts, Inc., a Breckenridge, Colorado-based ski resort, and its owner, Jason Pyle, in a civil action brought by the Colorado Attorney General's Office.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Denver, alleges that Vail violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Vail agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the complaint, Vail also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  In a parallel action, the Colorado Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued an order suspending the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter to Vail and ordering it to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains, and ordering Vail to pay civil penalties of $100,000, $50,000 and a $75,000 civil penalty.  Raup has agreed to a settlement where she will be permanently enjoined from violating the securities laws and the federal preemption provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(c) and 13(d)(2) and 14(a)(2)(A) and 15(b)(5)(B).  The settlement, which is subject to court approval, reserves the issue of liability for further determination by the court upon motion of the SEC.  On October 3, 2018, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against further violations of these provisions, and granted the court the right to order a hearing on the matter.  A hearing on October 4, 2018 is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Office of Insurance Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado Department of Health and Human Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC also encourages people to check background information before making a decision about whether to invest in an investment."
