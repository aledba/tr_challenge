  "summary": "On November 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Sheri Sprouse, a former registered representative of the Department of Social Security, that permanently enjoins her from raising a constitutional challenge to the agency's denial of her benefits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that Sprouse failed to disclose that she suffered from epilepsy, obesity, and degenerative joint disease, and that she was incapable of even low stress work.  According to the complaint, Sprouse's seizures were frequent and severe, and she experienced grand mal seizures on multiple occasions between 2008 and 2012.  Sprouse also alleges that, in 2008 and 2010, she had seizures at work, and in 2012, she was fired after having two seizures.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2009 Sprouse was unable to perform any meaningful work because of her epilepsy.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint Sprouse filed a complaint with the SEC alleging that the agency had improperly appointed Sprouse as an employee of a daycare center.  On September 30, 2010, the date Sprouse sought treatment with her general practitioner for back and foot pain after falling downstairs.  She was subsequently terminated from her job as a caretaker for a special needs child, retail cashier, and daycare provider, and was subsequently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The complaint charges Sprouse with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-17740 (Dec. 13, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
