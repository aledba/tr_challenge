  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the agency for its role in an air quality emergency.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that the federal government violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to provide a reasoned explanation for the agency\u2019s actions.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that, in violation of the federal law, the agency overstated the contribution of upwind States to downwind air quality by more than three-quarters of a percentage of the air quality in those states.  According to the complaint, in 2016, EPA issued an update to the Good Neighbor Provision, which requires states to meet their obligations to reduce their air pollution by at least 10 percent by the end of the year.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, EPA has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,400 per metric ton of NOx, which is equal to the penalty imposed by the federal agency, and orders the agency to provide an accounting of the amount of any reduction in the downwind state's air quality.  On May 4, 2020, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the SEC, and ordering the SEC to conduct an examination of the agency's compliance with the federal air quality rules, including whether there is sufficient evidence to determine whether the agency has acted reasonably and thus has a reasonable basis for its actions. The SEC also issued an order suspending the issuance of a Form 10-Q, imposing a $25,000 civil penalty, and imposing an $8,500 civil penalty.  A hearing on the matter has been scheduled for May 24, 2020.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Feb. 13, 2020).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Air Quality Quality Assurance Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Department of New Jersey, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
