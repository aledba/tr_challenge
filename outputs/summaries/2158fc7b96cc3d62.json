  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment in favor of Monmouth University, which is entitled to charitable immunity under the federal charitable immunity law.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Monmouth County, New Jersey, alleges that, on December 9, 2012, college student Frances Green was injured while attending a concert at Monmouth's Multipurpose Activity Center. According to the complaint, Green was not a student at the time of her injury, but was a beneficiary of the university's educational efforts when she was injured. The complaint further alleges that the university paid a $10,000 rental fee for the auditorium and that the concert was an \"educational experience\" when it was not an educational one. The SEC alleges that Green's injuries were not related to the University's educational objectives and that, in hosting the concert, the university violated its duty of care to her.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Education and the Department of Justice today announced that it has issued an order suspending the registration of certain non-profit entities, including the New Jersey Academy of Aquatic Sciences, which Green attended. The court also ordered Monmouth to pay a $20,000 civil penalty. The university has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Steven J. Kerstetter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation entered a judgment against Monmouth, finding that it violated the charitable immunity provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering the university to comply with the court's order, and appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue a civil injunctive order against the university and to appoint a receiver for the receiver. The receiver also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public university for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Monmouth agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, ordering it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000. The college agreed to the settlement without admitting, denying, or denying Green's allegations, to the appointment of a receiver and to the payment of a civil penalty of $25,000"
