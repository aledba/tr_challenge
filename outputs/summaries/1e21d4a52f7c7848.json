  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a temporary restraining order against Bryan W. Whitfield Memorial Hospital and its radiological technician, Leland Bert Taylor, Jr., who they allege sexually assaulted them while they were patients of the hospital.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Mobile, Alabama, the hospital and Taylor violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that the hospital was on notice of the alleged sexual assaults by Taylor in 2015 and subsequent to his employment with the hospital ending on October 7, 2015, when the hospital terminated Taylor's employment.  As alleged in the complaint, Taylor had acted negligently and/or wantonly by sexually assaulting the patients while he was employed as a medical provider.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Whitfield and Taylor have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the Exchange Act, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court denied the hospital's motion for a writ of mandamus and ordered the hospital to respond to certain discovery requests and to enter a protective discovery order.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert C. Mascianica of the United States District Court in Mobile issued an order granting the hospital the right to compel discovery in its ongoing litigation against Taylor. The court also granted the hospital a preliminary injunction and ordered it to comply with the court's order. The settlement is subject to court approval.
