  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that, in 2013, defendant Luis Valenzuela, of Oxnard, California, stole a bicycle and on that basis was convicted of both felony grand theft (\u00a7 487, subd. (a) and street terrorism (\u00a7 1170), which is a felony for which a defendant has a prior felony conviction) and a felony felony for the purpose of reclassifying as a felony a felony.  According to the complaint, the defendant also had suffered a prior serious felony conviction for street terrorism, which he had successfully petitioned to have reclassified as a misdemeanor.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2014, a jury in a trial that was not yet final on the felony theft conviction found that the defendant had engaged in a pattern of criminal gang activity, and that he had been previously sentenced to nine years eight months in prison for the street terrorism crime.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants were not convicted of a specific felony, and the defendant was not a member of any gang.  Instead, the court found that defendant had violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by failing to show up to court for a hearing on the merits of the case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Complaint and the Court of Appeal, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to their respective criminal convictions.   The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-registered broker-dealer.  Separately, the SEC has issued an order requiring the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $1,000,000 and $2,500, respectively, for each felony conviction they have ever been convicted of, and ordering them to repay their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest in the same amount of money that they received from the sale of the stolen bicycle.  On November 5, 2014, the District Court entered a judgment ordering the defendants' immediate release from prison and ordering the reclassification of their prior felony convictions to misdemeanors.  It also ordered that the defendants pay a $100,000 civil penalty, which is subject"
