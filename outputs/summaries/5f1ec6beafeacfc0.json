  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the National Labor Relations Board (\"NLRB\") in a related action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the NLRB violated Section 9(a) of the federal Labor Relations Act and Rule 9(b) thereunder.  According to the complaint, the Board improperly certified Local 669 as the exclusive bargaining representative of a unit of AFP sprinkler fitters.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, by designating the unit as a \"contract bar,\" the Board failed to establish a \"clear and compelling\" relationship between AFP and its members.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's final judgment, the board consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Board from violating the provision of the NLRA, and orders it to conduct an election in the unit at the appropriate time.   The final judgment also orders the Board to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $100,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter.
