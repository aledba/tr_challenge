  "summary": "On September 14, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Zsolt Rumy for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Rumy, a Florida resident, founded Zoltek and was its majority shareholder until Toray Industries, Inc. acquired it in 2014.  The complaint alleges that Rumy made false and misleading statements to Toray's outside counsel, including a representation that the value of the ZOLtek Litigation was zero, and that he knew that any harm would be felt by plaintiffs in Illinois.  Rumy also allegedly used his existing relationship with Toray to create a three-way relationship with the Illinois-based company.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Rumy.    The SEC's Complaint alleges that, based on Rumy's conduct, the court found that, in violation of the federal securities laws, the defendant had to be the only link between the defendant's conduct and the forum state.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by John R. Felland and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Dean A. Monco and John S. Mortimer. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
