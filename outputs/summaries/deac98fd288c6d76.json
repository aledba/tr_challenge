  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment against a former cashier charged with stealing from an Indian tribe.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Nikolle Denise Dixon, who was employed as a cashier at a convenience store owned by the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to establish a reasonable, legal alternative to the defendant's alleged duress defense.  According to the complaint, Ms. Dixon was exposed to traumatic events (i.e., the sexual abuse and threats of extreme violence against her mother if she reported the abuse) and that she had no reasonable alternative to her actions.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Dixon was also exposed to a history of sexual abuse from her stepfather, who had threatened her with a gun and threatened to kill her if she did not comply with a court order to remove the gun from her possession.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia today announced criminal charges against Dixon.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint filed in the federal district court in Oklahoma, Dixon consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay disgorgement of $1,536,81 in prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Dixon also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer and director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 6, 2014).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant that the court will consider the merits of the case against her.  On June 20, 2016, the court granted the government's request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against future violations, which would prohibit Dixon from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service, and from making any judgments regarding the adequacy of a defendant's record. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00a0The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Dolan."
