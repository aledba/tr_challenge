  "summary": "On May 25, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi entered a final judgment against Johnson Electric, a Mississippi-based electrical services company, for failing to file an annual report in 2014.  According to the SEC's complaint, Johnson Electric was established in 1993 and provided electrical services to general contractors on large commercial construction projects in the Hattiesburg area.  The complaint alleges that, beginning in 2010, Johnson bought electrical parts and supplies for various jobs from Robinson Electric Supply, and in 2013, he requested an accounting of the company.  In 2014, the SEC found that Robinson Electric was delinquent in payment to Johnson and owed $93,522 of what remained on Johnson's balance.  On June 5, 2013, the court granted Johnson's request for an accounting and appointed a special master to review the company's business records.  Johnson and Robinson Electric agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and order the company to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $232,900.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the company agreed to a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mississippi Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Office of Inspector General in this matter."
