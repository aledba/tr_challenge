  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio on November 15, 2019 entered a final judgment in favor of the Ohio Attorney General's Office and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in a parallel action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dayton, Ohio, alleges that Ohio law Section 3517.21(A)(1) prohibits the use of undercover investigative reporting, including by news organizations, for the purpose of reporting on political campaigns.  According to the complaint, the Ohio Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General previously issued an order suspending the practice of undercover journalism in the state.  In its order, the court found that the Ohio law violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 5b-5(b) and (c) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On November 16, 2019, the Court granted a temporary restraining order against the defendants and ordered the investigation of the matter to be conducted by the Division of Enforcement's Public Finance Abuse Unit, with assistance from the Office of Compliance's Market Abuse Unit's Analysis and Detection Center, and with the assistance of the Division's Enforcement Division.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 8, 2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Public Information Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Scott A. Birkenheier and supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.\u00c2\u00a0 The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.
