  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona today entered a final judgment against the City of Scottsdale for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, Arizona, alleges that, on February 8, 2016, Michelle Shortt, head of the Arizona chapter of The Satanic Temple, asked that the city remove her from the scheduled invocation schedule. According to the complaint, Ms. Shortt agreed to give the invocation on the basis of her religious beliefs. The complaint also alleges that she and others initiated the invocation when she was denied the opportunity to give it. The SEC alleges that the City's decision to remove Shortt from the schedule constituted a violation of the federal securities laws, and that she was not entitled to the right to participate in the invocation because she had suffered an \"injury in fact\" as a result of the city's actions.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Shortt was not a member of the Satanic Temple when she gave the invocation, and the city subsequently removed her from its scheduled schedule.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Shortt consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On July 16, 2019, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Shortt and ordered her to return to her home state of Arizona, where she resides. The court also issued an order suspending her from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering her to comply with the court's order. The order also prohibits her from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any offering of any kind of religious or charitable organization. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against her for her role in the Arizona case.  A hearing is scheduled for May 24, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-00342-KGB (2014).  In a related matter, the SEC today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Arizona-based entities that claimed to be exempt from federal law, including those charged by the SEC with violations of Section 17(b)(3) and Rule 17(a) thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit."
