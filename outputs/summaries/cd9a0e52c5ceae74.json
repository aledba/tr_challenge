  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Gilbert Hyatt, a California resident, for failing to respond to a collection of information requested by or for a government agency.  According to the court's order, filed on August 16, 2016, the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) submitted a number of collections of information to the OMB, as required by the federal agency rule. The OMB did not approve or disapprove these collections, because three regulatory exceptions to the definition of \u201cinformation\u201d fell outside the scope of the agency's decisionmaking process. The court also denied Hyatt's request for a control number for the purported collections.  The court's final judgment, on September 13, 2013, permanently enjoins Hyatt from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Hyatt. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Oakland, charges Hyatt with violating Section 13(b)(2) and 13(a)(3) and (4) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, and an officer and director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hyatt consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 12 of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20, and ordering him to comply with the Commission's order. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-11 (2014).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
