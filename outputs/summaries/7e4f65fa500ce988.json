  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Salt Lake City Corporation for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on March 10, 2010, the City of Salt Lake and its founder, Jeff Salt, learned of the city\u2019s plan to waive a fee for the production of records in response to a complaint by the Salt Lake County Records Committee. The complaint alleges that the city failed to consider that the fee waiver was unreasonable and that it should have conducted a non-deferential review to determine if the city was entitled to a reasonable fee waiver. Instead, the complaint alleges, the city did not consider the need for a fee waiver and instead directed the city to provide the requested records to the records committee.  The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the Utah Division of Securities and Exchange Commission (DSC) issued an order requiring the court to determine whether the city had standing to file a complaint for judicial review in the district court. The order also requires the court determine whether it has the jurisdiction to issue a judgment ordering a hearing in which the court will determine whether to grant or deny the city's request for a hearing.  In its judgment, the court found that the City had standing, that it had the burden of proof, and that the court should have held a hearing on the merits of the case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the District Court agreed with the court that the case should have been handled by the Division of Records, which had jurisdiction over the matter at the time of the hearing. The court also ruled that the District court had the right to issue an order imposing a preliminary injunction against the City, which it did not do.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Utah Office of Public Finance and Assurance. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Department of Justice and the Utah Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
