  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Louisiana-based company accused of defrauding insurance companies out of millions of dollars.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that BCBSLA violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, BCBSla failed to adequately investigate the allegations in its complaint, and instead delayed issuing a judgment that permanently enjoins the company from violating the securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $110,000.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against Encompass, finding that the company violated the anti-fraud provisions and ordering a new trial.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the company consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating these provisions, ordering the company to pay civil penalties of $100,000, and imposing an officer-and-director bar.  BCBSL agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction.  It also agreed to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Compliance and Risk Analysis and Assessments with assistance from the Division of Enforcement's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Louisiana Attorney General's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
