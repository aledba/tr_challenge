  "summary": "On September 16, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that B.C. was born to C.R. and Appellant, who was married to the child's mother, at the time of his birth.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that, in the course of raising the child, Appelant sought a paternity test that proved that he was not the biological father of the child.  Appelleant also requested a genetic test to prove that there was a 99.99% probability that Roy was the father.  In a parallel action, the Maryland Department of Social Services filed a motion for a finding of non-paternity in a separate case, which was ultimately dismissed by the court.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000, $20,000 and $50,000 respectively, for violations of Section 15(a)(1) and (3) of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder.  On September 17, 2016 the court entered a judgment ordering a permanent injunction, ordering Appeleant to comply with the court's order, and requiring him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  As part of the settlement, Appeleand agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  It also ordered Appelleand to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  Finally, the court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Appeleto pay a $75,000 penalty in the parallel action.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, and the case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Public Health."
