  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against the Broward County School Board for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that, beginning in 2005, the school board refused to include one-on-one Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) therapy in the children\u2019s IEPs.  According to the complaint, this was in violation of the policy of never including any ABA-based method or strategy in an IEP.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the School Board had impermissibly excluded the triplets' parents from attending the initial child study meeting.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the district court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the school district from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny-per-share in the amount of $100,000.  Additionally, the court ordered the school Board to pay a $75,000 civil penalty to be determined by a court at a later date.  On May 24, 2004, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Miami against a Broward school district for violating Section 1415(f)(1)(A) and Rule 1415 thereunder, charging the district school district with violating Section 12(b)(5) and 13(a)(2)(A).  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgment of illusory gains plus interest, and civil penalties.  Separately, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Broward announced criminal charges against the district attorney.  A hearing is scheduled for June 21, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 549 (January 4, 2013).  In a parallel action, the United Kingdom Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges in the case against the District Attorney.   The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Education Division. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC&rdquo.;s Office of Advocacy and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
