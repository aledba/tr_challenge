  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against two former co-workers for negligently carrying out the details of their work on the job.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, Missouri, alleges that Dale Ogletree and Scott Kidwell violated the company's nondelegable duty to provide a reasonably safe workplace by failing to properly supervise the co-employees.  According to the complaint, the company was not liable for any injuries to its employees, but rather for a co-worker who was negligent in carrying out his or her duties.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Ogletrow and Kidwell failed to adequately perform their duties as part of the company\u2019s duty to guarantee a safe work environment.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, neither of these defendants were liable for injuries to their employees.  Instead, the SEC alleges that each of the defendants breached a duty separate and distinct from the employer-employee duty.  For example, in 2005, Conner was injured while working on a project to retire a transformer bank for his employer, Intercounty Electric Cooperative Association (\u201cIntercounty\u201d).  Conner and the rest of the crew mistakenly believed he had successfully de-energized the line and began working next to it, causing a loose nail to fly into the plaintiff's eye.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the company-employer reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against each of them.  Additionally, the court granted a temporary restraining order and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants, and ordered the company to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Conner, Kelly L. Gibson, John R. Rymas, and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
