  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Kevin Durand Jackson, Jr., a former Carrollton, Ga., resident, who was convicted of two counts of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Jackson was charged in May 2015 with violating the securities laws by participating in a series of high-level gang activity, including a December 2014 shooting at Lakeview Apartments in Carrollton. The SEC alleges that Jackson was a member of the Bloods, a criminal street gang, and that he was associated with the Crips. The complaint further alleges that, prior to the trial, Jackson and a co-indictee who testified at Jackson\u2019s trial agreed not to request a pattern jury charge on a Street Gang Act violation. Jackson also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Jackson.  On May 30, 2015, Jackson pleaded guilty to one count of felony murder and a related conduct-based injunctive action, and was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and ordered to pay a $25,000 civil penalty. The jury deliberated for two hours before finding Jackson guilty on all of these counts.  Jackson's sentencing hearing was scheduled for June 5, 2019.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael O. McCluskey and Glenn S. Gordon of the Atlanta Regional Office. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gordon. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
