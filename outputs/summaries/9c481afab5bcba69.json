  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of attempted first-degree assault in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 13A-6-20 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  According to the SEC's complaint, on April 5, 2008, Keandre Harris was indicted for, and pled guilty to, an attempt to commit a violent felony, and was subsequently sentenced to a fifteen-year minimum sentence as an armed career criminal.  The complaint alleges that Harris was subject to the mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years imprisonment for a felony that required a specific intent to commit, and that he did not intend to commit that violent felony.  As alleged in the complaint, however, Harris was not asked and never said whether the \"intent\" to commit the violent felony was sufficient to qualify as a felony under the federal securities laws.  Instead, the complaint alleges, Harris entered a guilty plea based on his three prior felony convictions, which the court found to be a \"violent felony.\"  The SEC also found that Harris had a prior felony conviction that required him to be convicted of a felony for which he had no prior criminal record.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Harris, charging him with one of those counts.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Harris consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of five years, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit, and from serving as an officer or director of a public company for at least five years.  Additionally, the court granted Harris's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations, ordered him to comply with the court's order, and issued a temporary restraining order against him.  On May 9, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal court against Harris for the same conduct alleged in Minshew v. State, 884 F.3d 1319, 1325 (11th Cir. 2018).  The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
