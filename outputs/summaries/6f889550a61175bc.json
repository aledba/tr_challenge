  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against the City of Saratoga Springs and City of Buffalo in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that, from at least July 2017 through September 2017, the City and the Village of Ballston Spa, Inc. (hereinafter collectively referred to as the City) have been contemplating installing a continuous nonmotorized trail to improve pedestrian and bicycle travel along Geyser Road.  According to the complaint, the city incorrectly classified the project as an unlisted action, prepared a short environmental assessment form and considered areas of potential environmental concern, and later issued a negative declaration for the project.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, this was not a violation of the prior public use doctrine.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the City failed to adequately consider the potential environmental impacts of the project and failed to provide an adequate written explanation for its negative declaration.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of York today announced criminal charges against the city.  On September 5, 2018, the court entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the City from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders the city to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's Order, the Commission has agreed to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining the city from violating the federal securities laws, ordering the City to provide a reasoned elaboration of its determination, and ordering the city's condemnation of portions of petitioners' property pursuant to eminent domain. The final judgments also order the Commission to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty to be determined by the court upon motion of the Commission. The Commission has also agreed to a $500,000 officer and director bar, and to the appointment of a receiver to determine the amount of remediation and other relief that the Commission is entitled to. In a related administrative proceeding, the Court also ordered the Commission of Inspections and Examinations to determine whether to issue an order appointing a receiver for any remediation project that is subject to court approval.  Finally, on September 13, 2018 the Commission issued a preliminary injunction against the issuance of any additional emergency relief, including a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and a conduct-based injunction prohibiting the Commission from issuing or selling any emergency relief. The order also prohibits the issuance or sale of any security"
