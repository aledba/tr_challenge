  "summary": "On July 17, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York entered a final judgment against James A. Reynolds, Jr., a former Oxford County, Ohio, resident, who was convicted in December 2016 on eleven counts of sexual abuse.  According to the SEC's complaint, Reynolds was charged with four counts of gross sexual abuse and six counts of unlawful sexual contact in 1997 and 1998.  The complaint alleges that, from approximately nine years old, Reynolds repeatedly touched the victim's genitals and forced her to put her mouth on his genitals, which he did at least once weekly over the course of six years.  As alleged in the complaint, the alleged abuse occurred on the road and while out camping, and Reynolds allegedly forced the victim to put his mouth on her genitals while they were alone in the apartment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Reynolds, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rules 206(3) and 206 (4) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC, Reynolds has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities for a period of at least six years, and requires him to show cause and effect of the alleged conduct.  On July 18, 2018, the court granted Reynolds's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 206 of the Exchange Act, and ordered him to surrender his passport and be barred from associating with any person with whom he has a history of misconduct.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Sansone and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the FBI's Office of Inspector General."
