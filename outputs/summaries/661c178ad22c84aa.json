  "summary": "On April 18, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against Gary Donelson Guion, Jr., a Texas resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that, on July 24, 2017, Gary filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that he had the exclusive right to designate a child's primary residence without geographic restriction, that Laura had moved to Texas at the time of the divorce decree, and that she had recently remarried.  According to the complaint, the court found that, based on this finding, Gary failed to show any material and substantial change in circumstances, that he anticipated relocating to Texas.  In a parallel action, on May 30, 2018, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals issued an order granting Gary's motion for summary judgment, ordering him to pay $5,000.00 in attorney's fees to Laura's counsel, and ordering Laura to pay a $7,500 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Gary consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders that he pay $6,500 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his legal fees.  On May 31, Gary also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any final judgment that imposes a temporary restraining order against him from violating these provisions, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5492804 (July 24, 2016, no pet).  The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
