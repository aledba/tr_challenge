  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against a Maryland-based insurance company and its general manager for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that, from March 2, 2012 to May 9, 2014, Kyle C. Muehlhauser, the general manager and majority owner of Rams Head at Savage Mill, LLC (Rams Head), conducted video surveillance of women using the restroom at Rams Head.  According to the complaint, the defendants did not have a duty to defend themselves against the allegations in the complaint.  Instead, the complaint alleges that they violated the anti-fraud provision of the Exchange Act, and that, as a result of their conduct, they were not entitled to coverage under Exchange Act policies.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against the defendants.  As set forth in the SEC's Complaint, the SEC alleges that the defendants violated the reporting provisions of Exchange Act Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (3) and (4) and that defendants violated Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act Section 12(a) and 13(c) thereunder and Rule 17a-1.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendants agreed to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating Exchange Act Rule 13a-14, and order them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, and to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  Additionally, the court ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $25,000 and ordered them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest in a separate, later declaratory judgment action.  On the same day, the Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case that was being handled by the agency's Office of Inspector General, with the assistance of the Maryland Office of Insurance Regulation, the Office of Financial Regulation, and the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 24, 2014.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221."
