  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Bank of America, N.A., a Florida-based mortgage lender, for defrauding a Florida resident out of $260,000.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that in 2006, Carmen Brexendorf purchased a home in Kissimmee, Florida for $250,000 with a mortgage serviced by BOA. According to the complaint, after BOA advised her to refrain from making mortgage payments, she made a financial accommodation in the form of reduced Trial Period payments. The complaint alleges that on November 25, 2009, BOA charged her account for a property inspection on sixty-one occasions between 2008 and 2014, and failed to tell her that being \"past due and in default\" on her mortgage was a prerequisite for a HAMP modification. In addition, the complaint alleges in the complaint that on May 12, 2014, the date BOA foreclosed on her home, she suffered significant losses of home equity and \"money paid as trial payments\" to BOA, regardless of whether she had discovered them when she suffered them when they occurred. The SEC also alleges that BOA violated Rule 9(b) of the Banking Statute of Frauds. The court entered a temporary restraining order, which prohibits violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordered the SEC to conduct a parallel criminal investigation.  In its order, the court also issued an order suspending the SEC's asset freeze, freezing the assets of all defendants, and imposing a civil penalty of $1.5 million. The Court's order also prohibits the SEC from imposing a penny stock bar against any individual or entity charged with a similar conduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the SEC has agreed to a permanent injunction, to which the court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-cv-01819-PAB-KLM, 2013 WL 3470827.  On May 15, 2018, the Court granted a motion for preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins all defendants from violating the charged provisions, orders the SEC and BOA to jointly and severally disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains, and orders them to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively."
