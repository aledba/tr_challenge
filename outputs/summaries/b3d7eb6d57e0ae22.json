  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against a Michigan man accused of orchestrating a series of events that led to Beasley's death.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Michigan, alleges that, on January 5, 2015, Michael J. Beasley was arrested by Detroit Police Department officers on a tip-off that he was going to kill Beasley. The complaint alleges that Beasley told the officers that he wanted to kill him because he had a gun and wanted to \"play nice for me.\" The complaint further alleges that the officers told Beasley that they would \"tamper\" him with the gun and that he \"wouldn't say anything.\" Beasley allegedly did not respond to the officers' questions and instead went into hiding. The SEC alleges that when Beasley confronted the officers, Beasley replied, \"I want him gone, but have to pick a better time, he has weapons, don't say nothing, and if he knows he would hurt me or worst [sic] to me, he threatened me and everyone I love.\" The SEC also alleges that in a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against Beasley, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a related matter, the SEC's Office of Criminal Investigations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Abuse Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage defendants to check the background of anyone selling or offering them advice on how to protect themselves from unreasonable searches and seizures.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Justice, and the Michigan State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
