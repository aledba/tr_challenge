  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a deferred disposition order against a juvenile who was charged with shoplifting and subsequently sentenced to twelve months of community service.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 26, 2018, T.D., then a seventeen-year-old juvenile, entered an admission before the court that he or she had been previously incarcerated for shoplifting in violation of the mandatory community service hours of the federal criminal code. The complaint alleges that, in exchange for entry of the deferred disposition, the defendant agreed to be permanently suspended from participating in community service and to be sentenced to a twelve-month deferred disposition.  The complaint further alleges that the defendant failed to complete thirty hours of community work, which is mandatory for juveniles, and that the court declined the State's request for a bench warrant at that time, and ordered both the state and probation to continue to investigate a proper address for the defendant.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the juvenile consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court granted the juvenile's motion for a temporary restraining order against further violations of the anti-fraud provisions, ordered him to comply with the court's order, and appointed a receiver to assist with the receiver's investigation.  On May 1, 2019, a federal district court in New Jersey issued an order requiring the defendant to submit to a court-ordered suspension or postponement of her community service obligations. The court also ordered that the juvenile be assessed a laboratory analysis fee in cases involving controlled dangerous substances to both adults and juveniles.  To learn more about supervised release, see www.sec.gov/july-20-11(b).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
