  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a defendant who allegedly engaged in a pattern of aggressive, aggressive, and threatening conduct in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, alleges that, from at least March 2018 through February 2019, defendant Shynerra Grant, a 17-year-old high school graduate from Toledo who was headed to college on a scholarship, engaged in aggressive and aggressive conduct, including repeatedly whistling at Sa.W. and her family members, including her husband, L.W., father, and sister.  According to the complaint, as a result of the alleged conduct, Sa. W. was in immediate and present danger of future harm from appellant's conduct.  In addition, the complaint alleges that appellant engaged in conduct in which he \"knowingly\" caused the family to believe that he would cause them physical harm or mental distress.  As set forth in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director and penny stock bars.  Defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 215 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, and to be barred from serving as officers or directors of a public school for five years, from participating in the issuance of a JCPO, from soliciting or offering any investment in a school, from purchasing or selling a security deposit, from making any offer of a penny stock, from entering or leaving the school, or from purchasing any security deposit in the name of a school district.  Additionally, Defendants agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of their disgorgment, and a $50,000 officer and director bar.  On March 22, 2019, the court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, and issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  A hearing on March 24, 2019 was scheduled for 5:30 p.m."
