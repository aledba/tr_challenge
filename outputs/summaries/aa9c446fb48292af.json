  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Hawai'i today entered a final judgment against a Honolulu Police Department officer who unlawfully conducted a search and seizure on a Waik\u012b Island beach.  According to the court's order, on June 4, 2013, officers stopped and questioned Weldon while he was lying down on a concrete slab adjacent to an apartment complex. The court found that the officers had reasonable suspicion that Weldon was engaged in a criminal activity and had a reasonable suspicion to search his backpack.  The court also found that Officer Wilson, who was on duty at the time the officers conducted the search, was not a reasonable person to approach Weldon and did not have reasonable suspicion of the person being stopped.

The order also prohibits Wilson from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service, and from conducting any search or conducting any other search of a person's personal property without reasonable suspicion or a reasonable basis to determine whether he or she has committed a crime.  Additionally, the court has ordered Wilson to pay $1,500 and a $500,000 penalty.
