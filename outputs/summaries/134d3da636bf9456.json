  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Deljuan Bankston.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Bankston violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Bankston was sentenced six months before the effective date of Amendment 798, and, as we now hold, the portion of that amendment applicable here is not retroactive.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, on remand, the sentencing judge would impose the same sentence regardless of whether Bankston had previously been convicted of a \"crime of violence\" under the prior federal sentencing guidelines.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 33 months imprisonment, the high end of the range she had calculated under the 2015 Guidelines, followed by three years of supervised release.  On August 1, 2016, the court granted Bankston's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  Bankston agreed to the settlement, which is subject to court approval.  After the settlement was announced, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Bankston, charging him with violating Section 17 (a)(2) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and with aiding and abetting Bankston\u2019s violations of Section 13(a)(1) and 13(b)(2)(A) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil monetary penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the FBI in this matter."
