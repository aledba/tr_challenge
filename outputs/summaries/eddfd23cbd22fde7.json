  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the Arizona Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) in finding Andrae ineligible for A.B. 12 benefits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, Arizona, alleges that, from 2007 to 2015, the juvenile court terminated dependency jurisdiction over a nonminor dependent, and ordered him placed in long-term foster care.  According to the complaint, the court's order, which was entered on January 13, 2015, required DCFS to provide the nonperson with information about the benefits of remaining in foster care, including the prerequisites for returning to foster care on their 18th birthday, and that the court should have provided him with a \"transitional independent living case plan.\"  In addition, the complaint alleges that DCFS failed to provide him with the necessary information to determine whether he was eligible to participate in continued foster care services.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from participating in any type of independent living program.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the district court entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant, ordering him to comply with the court order, and requiring him to submit a written 90-day transition plan for his release from custody. The court also ordered him to sign the JV-464INFO, which described the benefits and prerequisites that would justify the initial assumption of jurisdiction under section 300 of the Social Security Act of 1940, and required him to file a petition pursuant to subdivision (B) of that provision. The judge granted the request for a temporary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws and ordered the defendant to pay a $25,000 civil penalty. The case is being handled by Nadia G. and Glenn S. Gordon. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Juvenile Justice, and the Arizona Office of Child Advocacy and Advocacy."
