  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of B.M.'s motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 245(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on the morning of July 2, 2016, a 17-year-old defendant confronted her sister, Sophia, with a knife that she described as a \"butter knife.\" According to the complaint, the defendant used the knife only in the area of Sophia\u2019s legs, which were covered with a blanket. The complaint further alleges that the defendant did not use the knife in a manner that was \"capable of producing, and likely to produce, great bodily injury.\" The complaint also alleges that when confronted by Sophia, she covered herself with the blanket and did not attempt to stab the victim. The SEC alleges that B. M. used the butter knife only on the area where she had pulled up over her and the bedding, and that she did not hit the victim with the knife. The court also found insufficient evidence to sustain a finding that the knife was a deadly weapon.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against a second defendant for his alleged use of a knife in an unrelated criminal case.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in Manhattan granted the SEC's request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, which is pending final approval by the Court of Appeal.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the court also issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert on the subject. The order also ordered the SEC to conduct a fact-finding investigation, which will be conducted by John Rymas and Glenn S. Gordon, with the assistance of the Office of the Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gordon and Ms. Gordon. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17."
