  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for attempted sexual battery in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on April 4, 2012, a jury deliberated for less than two hours before finding Thomas guilty of one count of attempted criminal battery.  According to the complaint, Thomas told the jury that he had a friend who had been falsely accused of a sex crime and thought, therefore, false allegations of sexual impropriety were easy to make.  Thomas also allegedly told his friend, who was a member of a cognizable racial group, that \"the other night\" and \"that she had performed fellatio in the townhouse parking lot in March.\"  The complaint further alleges that Thomas had told the friend that he would \"cut all ties\" with her after the alleged incident, and that he did not believe the trial court made a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the jury found Thomas liable for the lesser-charged offense of attempted sexual Battery, which requires a defendant to show cause and effect of a crime to be committed.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Thomas consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of his prison sentence.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert B. Sansone of the United States District Court in Orleans Parish issued a temporary restraining order against Thomas, ordering him to surrender his passport, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against him.  At the same time, Judge Sansone issued an order suspending Thomas from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering the SEC to conduct an independent, fair and impartial investigation of the matter.  To learn more about this matter, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  For further information, see Criminal Code Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3(a) and (c) thereunder of the Commission on Securities and Exchange Commission Litigation Rule 17(b)(2)(A) and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-3, and 13b-11 thereunder, ordering Thomas to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay civil penalties, and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company"
