  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in favor of President Donald J. Trump's removal from office.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., alleges that, after the 2016 election, President Trump and his associates encouraged and advanced this perception by, among other things, using the President's surname as the Hotel's logo and promoting the Hotel during press conferences and meetings with government officials. As a result, foreign dignitaries have \"flocked\" to the Hotel.  According to the complaint, many of these customers chose the Hotel because of a \"perception\" that patronizing the Hotel would give them the unfair advantage that the Hotel had gained from being the President of the United States.  In fact, the complaint alleges that the hotel's association with President Trump did not amount to a cognizable unfair-competition claim under District law, and neither the President nor his hotel had interfered with access to the property.  Instead, the court held that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1442(a)(1) of the federal officer removal statute and ordered the hotel to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Cork consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, which will be offset by a civil penalty of $100,000.  On March 9, 2017, Cork filed a complaint in the U.C. Superior Court against President Trump, alleging that he and his companies violated District law by failing to disclose to the court that they had violated the anti-fraud provision of the District's officer-and-director statute. The court also denied Cork's request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against further violations of District law.   The case was investigated by the Office of Compliance and the Division of Enforcement's Office of Inspector General, which issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
