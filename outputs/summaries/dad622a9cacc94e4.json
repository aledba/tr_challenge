  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by Richard Palmer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on November 5, 2015, the trial court improperly excluded four prospective jurors for cause in connection with a medical malpractice case that occurred on November 24, 2014.  According to the complaint, Mr. Palmer told the jury that he had worked all of his life to support his wife, and that he was never sanctioned by the AANS.  He also allegedly stated that he did not know if he could personally file a civil lawsuit for injuries even if he was paralyzed.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant's counsel, Guy Schexnayder, Chad Bourgeois, and Jordan O'Bryant, all indicated that they would not be able to apply the preponderance of the evidence standard to the facts of the case, and they acknowledged that they had difficulty being fair.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  On November 17, 2017, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered them to submit to the SEC a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.5 million, and ordering them to disgorge their allegedly unearned gains with interest in the amounts of $2.2 million and $1 million, respectively.   The defendants also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Broussard and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission in this matter."
