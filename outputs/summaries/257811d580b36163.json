  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against a California man who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oceanside, California on May 24, 2014, Michael C. (Father) and his wife, Autumn H. (Amanda F.), raised the issue of parental rights and adoption by claiming that the agency had made \"active efforts\" to prevent the breakup of the Indian family.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to the agency's representations to the court, Father did not participate in the reunification efforts and instead, asked counsel to do so directly.  As set forth in the complaint, the court found beyond a reasonable doubt that Father had not forfeited the right to participate in family reunification services at the time of the 12-month review hearing, and that he did not have sufficient evidence to support his claims.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that the court failed to advise Father personally of his fair-to-poor judgment, bad judgment, and anger management, when he requested that he be removed from the agency.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Father consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Father also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorge and prejudgment interests, and to be subject to an officer-and-director bar.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jennifer T. Tani of the San Diego Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Enforcement's Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Michael G. Braunstein. \u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the California Department of Health and Human Services, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, and the California Office of Child and Family Education and Advocacy."
