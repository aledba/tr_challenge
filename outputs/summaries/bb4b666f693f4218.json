  "summary": "On January 14, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico entered a temporary restraining order against Bentley Streett, a New Mexico-based convicted felon, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and other emergency relief.  In its order, the court found that, in violation of Section 3143 of the federal securities laws, Streett had the right to be held in the United States Marshals Service's custody pending sentencing.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, however, the Court found that Streett violated Section 3142(a)(1) and Section 1514(b)(5)(B) and Rule 1514 thereunder, and that the court had the authority to impose a temporary injunction or to prohibit Streett from contacting or attempting to contact any potential victims in this matter.  Streett has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.  On December 7, 2018, the Honorable Karen B. Molzen issued an arrest warrant for Streett pursuant to a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  According to the order, after Streett's arrest, he was ordered to remain in the custody of a federal marshal until he was sentenced in a court-ordered administrative proceeding.  As a result, the order issued by the court requires the court to determine the amount of time Streett will be incarcerated before imposing a permanent injunction or ordering Streett to surrender his passport.  For further information, see Litigation Release Order No. 17-0832 (January 24, 2020).  The SEC's complaint charges Streett with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 15(a).  In a parallel action, the Department of Justice today announced criminal charges against Streett.  Among other things, the SEC is seeking a permanent restraining order, a return of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.
