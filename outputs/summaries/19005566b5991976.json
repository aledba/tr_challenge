  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against defendant Andrew Kevin Williams, Jr., who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 148(a)(1) of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Santa Cruz, California on January 19, 2016, alleges that Williams engaged in a pattern of resisting, obstructing, or delaying officers in an attempt to arrest him.  According to the complaint, Williams resisted arrest by refusing to comply with officers' verbal commands to remove his hands from his pocket and refusing to follow an officer's orders to put him in a wrap.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Williams was arrested without incident, and the officers used excessive force on him, causing him to kick, choke, and kick his way out of the car.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Williams.  On January 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Williams, charging him with violating Section 148, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Williams consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, and orders him to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Williams agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities laws, and agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 541 (January 19, 2008).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant the right to a hearing and decision on whether to proceed with the case against Williams based on the facts and circumstances of the case.  It also names the officer who was arrested as a defendant who was not lawfully performing his or her duties as a peace officer.  To learn more about officer-involved shootings, see http://www.sec.gov/officer-involved-crimes.html  The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa, Chief of the San Diego Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the California State Attorney General's Office, the FBI, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Homeland Security, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Texas Department of Banking and Securities and the California Secretary of State's Office as relief defendants."
