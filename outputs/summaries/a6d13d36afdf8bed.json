  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Anthony L. Minor for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 625 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in February 2018, Minor was questioned by two officers in a private room in the home of a 15-year-old who was alleged to have committed a lewd act on a child.  According to the complaint, the officers asked Minor about his schooling and why he was at home instead of at school, and asked him if he had ever been arrested.  Minor replied that he did not know their names, but that he had recently turned 15 and had recently joined a group of friends who had engaged in a similar conduct.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the officers questioned Minor about the nature of the alleged conduct, and he refused to give them the names of the friends.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Minor consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating Section 625, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Additionally, the judgment orders Minor to cooperate with the investigation, which is continuing, with the assistance of an attorney, and requires him to provide a copy of the Complaint to the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 596 (2017).  The Complaint charges Minor with violating Sections 625.6 and 625.7, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The case is being handled by Kenneth S. Pyszka, John Rymas, and Amy Gwiazda of the New York Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigation Release\u00c2\u00a0to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to determine whether a defendant is in custody.\u00c2\u00a0On February 21, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Minor, charging him with violations of Sections 596, 591, and 16(a)(2) of the federal securities laws, and with aiding and abetting violations of Section 596. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Minor from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including in connection with the issuance of a court order requiring him to surrender his passport."
