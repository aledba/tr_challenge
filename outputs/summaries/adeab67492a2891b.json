  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Ronald Smith, Jr., who was convicted of two counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault and sentenced to 50 years' imprisonment.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on April 7, 2015, defendant entered S.N.'s room and entered her room with a knife and a roll of duct tape.  According to the complaint, defendant immediately demanded that the court give him a jury instruction on the lesser-included offense of first-degree murder, and then demanded that he show the knife to the jury.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a penalty of 25 years in prison and a $250,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against defendant.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the U.N. District Judge's Office issued a temporary restraining order, freezing defendant's assets, and barring him from participating in the issuance of any federal securities laws, including the securities registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-11-1.30(a)(1) (West 2014).  The Complaint also alleges that defendant violated Section 13(b)(2) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 206 (1) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty from the court.  Further, the Complaint alleges that defendants violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20 thereunder by failing to disclose that he had a knife in his pocket when he opened the door to the apartment.  As alleged, defendant also failed to disclose to the trial judge that he used a knife to commit the same felony that he committed in the first instance, and failed to show cause and effect in the second instance.  Finally, the complaint charges defendant with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Exchange Act Section 15(e) and Rules 17a-1 and (e) thereunder; and with aiding and abetting defendant's violations of Section"
