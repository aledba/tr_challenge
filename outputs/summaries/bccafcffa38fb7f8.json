  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against Kansas resident Kenneth Boysaw, who was previously convicted in Kansas of felony child molestation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that Boysaw violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Boysaw consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his sentence.  Boysaw also agreed to be barred from appearing and defending in person or by the court as a representative of the Kansas Attorney General's Office.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Boysaw.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that, in 2013, the Kansas attorney general's office issued an order requiring Boysaw to admit or deny the allegations of the complaint in a criminal case brought by a Kansas state district court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Kansas criminal case, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar from appearing or practicing before a jury.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the Court of Common Pleas granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering a hearing on May 4, 2019 and ordering the SEC to consider the merits of Boysaw's case.   The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the Kansas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
