  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio on June 17, 2016 entered a final judgment against two Ohio-based car repair companies, Evans Automotive Repair, Inc. (Evans) and Maurice L. Charlton, Jr. (BMI) for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, on October 13, 2014, Evans and Charlton filed a complaint and a motion for an order of possession against BMI Federal Credit Union, Inc., a repair facility at which Charlton was abandoned, alleging that Evans' lien on the vehicle had priority over subsequent mechanics or artisan liens applied to the vehicle for non-payment of repair and storage bills.  The court found that Evans had a right to possession of the vehicle and that he had a duty to maintain it until BMI paid all storage and repair bills for the car.  In a parallel action, on June 18, 2016, the Ohio Attorney General's Office announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Evans, charging him with violating Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $7,304.12 plus interest.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Evans agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security interest in a motor vehicle. The court also granted the parties' motion for summary judgment, ordering Evans to pay disgorgement of $1,038,768, prejudgment interest of $2,065, and a civil monetary penalty equal to the amount of his civil penalty.  On June 24, 2018, the court granted the defendants' request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the securities laws, ordered Evans to comply with the court order, and ordered the purchase of the motor vehicle by BMI. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Ohio Office of Financial Regulation and the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Market Abuse Unit in the Chicago Regional Office. The investigation was supervised by Scott A. Kasper and Antonia Shalov Mehraban of the Chicago Division of Economic and Risk Analysis."
