  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against Computer Sciences Corporation, a Virginia-based company that designed and developed NCTracks, a new system for managing reimbursement payments to health care providers for services provided to Medicaid recipients across North Carolina.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Computer Sciences and its principal office in Falls Church, Virginia, failed to exhaust their available administrative remedies.  According to the complaint, the company failed to timely respond to requests for reimbursement and failed to issue decisions on reimbursement claims.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to provide sufficient information about the nature of the problems with the reimbursement system to justify filing a complaint.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed on 31 January 2014, the court found that, because the company was not required to submit reimbursement claims before it became the Department of Health and Human Services, it was not entitled to a judgment ordering it to do so.  Specifically, the Court found that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it was liable to disgorge its ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the form of injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Computer Sciences has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $1,078,098, and $2,097, respectively, in a civil proceeding.  On the same day, the SEC filed a complaint against the company, alleging that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by failing to adequately assess the impact of the company's failure to respond to reimbursement claims, and failing to file a complaint for a contested case hearing.  Computer Sciences also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a federal securities law, to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $100,000.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Atlanta Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Office of Inspector General."
