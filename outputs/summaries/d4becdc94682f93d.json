  "summary": "On September 26, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware entered a final judgment against Sarif Biomedical, LLC, Brainlab AG, and Brainlab Medizinische Computersysteme GmbH, alleging that Sarif violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to adequately consider the merits of its claims.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Delaware on August 26, 2013, Sarif amended its claim construction position from the PTAB to the District Court, stating that it had a good faith, though ultimately incorrect, belief that its claims were not indefinite.  The complaint further alleges that, as a result of Sarif\u2019s delay in filing its claims, the district court failed to consider whether Sarif had a reasonable basis for concluding that the claim construction was not indefinite, and instead relied on its expert testimony.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In a parallel action, on September 27, 2015, the United States District Court in Delaware issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants\u2019 assets, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $1.2 million and $2 million, respectively, for Sarif and $100,000 for Brainlab and $50,000 each for BrainLab and Sarif AG.   The SEC also issued an order suspending Sarif from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, barring him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any penny stock, and from providing any other assistance in the development of a computer-assisted microsurgery installation.  Finally, the court issued a preliminary injunction, freezing Sarif II, $1,500, and $500,000 in attorney fees, and barring Brainlab from appearing, practicing, or appearing before the Commission on Patent and Trademark Abuse and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit in the Philadelphia Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and FINRA in this matter."
