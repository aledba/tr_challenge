  "summary": "On May 5, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota entered a final judgment against Steven Joyce, who was appointed as special administrator of the estate of Vera Mitchell of Grand Forks, North Dakota.  The court found that Steven Joyce violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court for Mountrail County, N.D., Steven Joyce failed to inform the court that he was entitled to an accounting of Mitchell\u2019s estate and that the settlement agreement was not binding.  Steven Joyce also failed to provide any evidence of the value of the second mortgage or the mineral interests that acted as security.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Steven Joyce consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $600,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Tarryl Joyce.  On May 20, the court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered a hearing to determine whether to proceed with the case. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Robert P. Mosteller and Anne T. McKenna, and supervised by Marc Blau. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Mertz. The case is being supervised by Ansu Banerjee. The court will determine the amount of monetary relief to be provided by the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 20, 2020)."
