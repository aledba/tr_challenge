  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the City of Rochester and its Board of Education in an administrative proceeding related to a proposed referendum on a city charter amendment.  According to the court's order, on July 8, 2018, the City Respondents filed an emergency action to halt an advisory referendum on the city's school district charter amendment, which was supposed to be implemented through a successful majority public vote.  The court also issued an order temporarily restraining the city from using the funds for any administrative proceedings related to the proposed referendum.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the City and its board of education for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the city and school district have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief, and ordering the city to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000.  Additionally, the court granted the City's request for a temporary restraining order against the issuance of the final judgment, which is subject to court approval.  On August 2, 2019, the Court issued an Order suspending the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any municipal securities for a period of five years, and imposing a $1.5 million civil penalty.   The Court's order also prohibits the City from issuing or selling any securities in connection with the proposed municipal referendum, and from issuing an order requiring the city or school district to comply with the Commission on Education's (CIE) Rules of Practice and Rules of Conduct.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2017.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Rochester, New York, charging the City with violating Section 23 of the Municipal Code, and with aiding and abetting violations of Section 9 of the Exchange Act and Rules 9-1-1. The SEC's complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, penny stock bars, and a penny stock bar against each of the defendants, as well as an officer-and-director bar against the city. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Eric R. Karpel and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the SEC's New York office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Eric S. Schiff."
