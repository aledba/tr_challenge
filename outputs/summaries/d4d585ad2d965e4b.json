  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Mizuho Bank, Ltd. and Mark Karpeles for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on September 20, 2017, Motto, a Pennsylvania resident, and Gregory Pearce, an Illinois resident, raised the issue of whether a federal court had jurisdiction over a company not subject to general jurisdiction in California, alleging that they suffered harm from Plavix, one of the manufacturer's drugs.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the court did not have jurisdiction over the company's claims.  In fact, according to the complaint, the defendants did not allege that they obtained or were treated for their injuries in California.  Rather, the SEC alleges that Motto and Pearce violated the federal securities laws by failing to show sufficient evidence to support their claims, and the court granted Motto's motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, which was unsealed on September 21, 2017 in federal district court in New York, the Court granted the SEC and the defendants' motion to proceed with a hearing on the merits of the case.  On September 24, 2017 the court issued a final opinion in favor of Motto in a related action brought in the same case by Pearce.  Motto has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $25,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Pearce has also agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty in the amount of $5,900, which is equal to the amount he has already agreed to pay in a separate action.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority and the U.K. Postal Inspection Service."
