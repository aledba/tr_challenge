  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Mother for her role in a child custody fraud.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Marin County, California, on February 18, 2011, the court terminated the parental rights as to Sister and Younger Brother and selected adoption as the permanent plan for all three of the children.  The complaint alleges that, on multiple occasions, Mother left the children at home unsupervised, causing a fire in the apartment.  In one instance, the complaint alleged that the children had been placed together during most of the period since their removal from Mother's custody, and that Mother had failed or was unable to supervise or protect them adequately.  As alleged in the complaint, the children were placed with their godparents, who were not in their best interests at the time of the alleged fraud, and placed in an intensive therapeutic foster home with no other children. The complaint further alleged that, in an effort to find an appropriate adoptive home for the children, Mother failed to submit to drug testing for several months, finally testing negative in October 2011.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaints, Mother consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt of the San Francisco Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson, Ms. Bort, and Mr. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Children and Families, the Marin County Sheriff's Office, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
