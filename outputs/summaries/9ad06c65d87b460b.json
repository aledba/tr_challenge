  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against St. Lucian's Residence, Inc. and Chapman Lumber, Inc., in a compensation proceeding.  According to the court's order, filed on March 19, 2014, the defendants filed a form 36, seeking to discontinue her temporary total disability benefits on the basis that she had reached maximum medical improvement. The complaint alleges that the commissioner improperly found that she was not totally disabled.  The complaint further alleges that, in her request for a formal hearing, the commissioner, by not allowing her to present evidence in support of her vocational total disability claim, violated her right to due process.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants, charging them with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges the defendants with violating Section 5 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 11, 2015, the Commission held a hearing on the form 36 to determine whether the plaintiff had reached minimum medical improvement and whether she should have undergone a corrective surgery. The Commission denied the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, and the complaint seeks a final judgment ordering the defendants to comply with the Commission order.  A hearing is scheduled for May 10, 2015.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5444 (January 28, 2014).  The Commission's order also prohibits the defendants from making materially false or misleading statements to the Commission in connection with any compensation proceeding, including regarding whether or not the plaintiff has reached maximum physical improvement.  It further prohibits the Commission from imposing any monetary penalty against the parties.  To settle the SEC's case, the court also ordered the Commission to consider the merits of the complaint against the Defendants, including whether to impose a civil penalty of $100,000, and whether to issue an officer-and-director bar for the defendants.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office."
