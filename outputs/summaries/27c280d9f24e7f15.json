  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Utah today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with a felony for his role in the murders.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Paul \"Pete\" Smith, who had become a drug informant following a previous arrest for drug possession with intent to distribute, provided false information to the court regarding Smith\u2019s right to counsel.  According to the complaint, Smith told the court that he needed \"a piece\" to \"defend [himself]\" when confronted by another individual who used illegal drugs with Smith.  He also allegedly told Smith that he wanted to \u201ctake out\u201d the other individual, and that he would \u201cshoot him if he wanted.\u201d  The complaint further alleges that Smith was not entitled to a jury instruction on the affirmative defense of compulsion, because he was not aware of the pre-waiver invocations of Miranda rights.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Utah today announced criminal charges against Smith arising from the same conduct.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Smith consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Smith also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Attorney General's Office in this matter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Utah Office of Criminal Investigations."
