  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against CityCentric Investments, LLC and Parker Place Group, LLC in an emergency action brought by Parker Shattuck, a former car dealership owner, and two individuals who contend that the City violated the federal securities laws by failing to adequately consider the environmental impact of a proposed oil-and-gas development.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, California, the City of Calabasas agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the City from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the City to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIR) for the proposed project.  The court also granted the City's request for a writ of mandamus, which requires the city to consider whether an EIR is required for a project that has a significant impact on the environment.  In its order, the court found that the city violated CEQA, and that it failed to consider the potential health risks to the project's workers and future residents.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the city consented to a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating these provisions, and ordering the court to order a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an accounting of any potential adverse effects of the project to be determined by the court upon motion of the court.  On November 1, 2011, the California Department of Health Services issued a letter certifying that the project \"may have a significant environmental impact\" when, in fact, the project did not have any significant environmental effect.  As a result, the Cal.App.4th and Cal.Rptr.3d 567, the District of Columbia issued an order prohibiting the city from imposing any such order, and the court granted the city's motion for an injunction against further violations of the federal laws.  A hearing on November 2, 2011 was scheduled for 11:30 a.m. for the Commission on Environmental Quality, which is required by law to determine whether a project is required under federal law, and a hearing scheduled for 12:30 p. m. on November 5, 2011. The hearing was delayed until after the Commission's order was issued. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Davidon Homes, Matthew Hagemann, and Eric Werner of the San Diego Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Hanauer and Ms. Braunstein. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the California Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the U."
