  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming today entered a final judgment against Paul Mullenax, the former Administrator of Wyoming State Hospital, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Wyoming, alleges that, on February 23, 2015, Ms. Gelok was found sitting in the hospital's dayroom with her neck kinked awkwardly and unable to move.  According to the complaint, as a result of her actions, she was unable to access adequate food, water, or bathroom facilities.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the WSH and the Department of Health failed to provide her with adequate medical care.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants had violated the right to reasonable protection under the federal securities laws, and that they were entitled to qualified immunity in their individual capacity.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's opinion, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  On May 12, 2016, a federal district court in Jackson, Wyoming, granted the Commission\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the Commission to conduct a hearing on the matter on May 26, 2017.  To determine whether to proceed with the hearing, the Commission requested a preliminary injunction, an order appointing a receiver, and an officer and director of a public health institution.   The Commission also requested that the Commission appoint a receiver to oversee the emergency response efforts to the emergency.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission also issued an order suspending the appointment of a receiver and ordering the receiver to provide a copy of the Complaint to the receiver for further determination by the court upon motion of the Commission.  This order also prohibits the Commission from issuing or selling any security-related documents or providing any other assistance to the Commission in its investigation of this matter.  Additionally, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction and an order requiring the receiver and director to comply with the Commission on Institutional Responses to the Rule of Law, including an order imposing a $80,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar.  A hearing is scheduled for May 24, 2017, to consider the merits of this action."
