  "summary": "The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois today announced that it has issued a final judgment ordering the filing of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition against Christopher V. Debtor.  According to the court's order, filed on April 13, 2017, Debtor filed a voluntary petition in the bankruptcy court under Chapter 13 of the United States Code.  The court found that, based on Debtor's financial condition, he was ineligible to qualify for Chapter 13 relief because he owed more than $394,725 in unsecured debt, which at the time was $1.184 million.  In its order, the court ruled that Debtor was eligible because he exceeded the statutory debt limit, and that he could not proceed under the Chapter 13 plan.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, the Court also ruled that it had no jurisdiction to determine whether to dismiss or convert the case under \u00a7109(e) or \u00a71307(c) of the bankruptcy code.  Debtor has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,184,200, prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Deborah M. Welshhans of the Court granted the Trustee's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Debtor to comply with the order.  A hearing scheduled for June 26, 2018 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-11668, Docket Entry 38, No. 527 (January 11, 2013).  The SEC's complaint charges Debtor with violating Section 13(b)(2) and 13(a) and (c) the federal securities laws, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgment of ill-gotten gains plus interest, and civil penalties. The SEC also seeks a preliminary injunction against Debtor, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper."
