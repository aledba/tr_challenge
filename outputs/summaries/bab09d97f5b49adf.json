  "summary": "On March 1, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Marco's Pizza, Inc., a Florida-based franchising company, and its former owner, John Soham, for violating the federal registration provisions of the company's trademarks.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, on March 4, 2019 and unsealed on March 5, 2020, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the registration provisions.  The final judgments, which are subject to court approval, order the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio today announced criminal charges against SOHam.  On March 6, 2019 the court granted the defendants' motion for preliminary injunctions, ordered Sohams to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and ordered the franchisor to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the companies consented to final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the franchising companies to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each, and imposing a $50,000 bar.  Sohamm also agreed to pay $75,000 to settle a civil action brought by the SEC against him by his former employer, the Florida Department of Commerce, alleging that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas in the Miami Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Moltan and Ms. Cooper. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office and the Ohio Department of Banking and Securities and Investments."
