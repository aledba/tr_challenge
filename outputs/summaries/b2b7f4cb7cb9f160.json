  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Vicente Cuevas-Lopez, a Mexican citizen who was previously ordered deported or removed from the United States for a prior felony conviction, for a second-degree burglary in violation of the federal sentencing laws.  The court entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, on March 10, 2020, a federal district court in Arizona issued an order imposing a five-year, seven-year prison sentence.  According to the court's order, the amount of time that a defendant has to serve as a single sentence is determined by a combination of factors, including the severity of the offender's prior criminal conviction, the length of a sentence imposed, and the severity and severity of a defendant\u2019s previous felony conviction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Judge Graber agreed with the court that the single sentence rule applies to all prior criminal convictions, and that it is appropriate to use the three-level rule in determining whether an enhancement applies to those prior convictions. The court also agreed that the \"single sentence rule\" applies to any prior conviction for which the sentence imposed was longer than five years or more.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release No. 5, No. 17-cv-01221 (March 21, 2020).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, based on the findings of the Commission's investigation, the court improperly imposed the single-sentence rule, which requires a court to determine whether a defendant is entitled to an additional three-year sentence based on his prior criminal history.  It further alleges that the Court improperly imposed a seven-level enhancement based on a previous conviction for a felony reentry offense and that, in the context of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(3)(A) enhancements, a court should not have aggregated prior convictions under the same rule.   The complaint also alleges that a federal judge improperly imposed an eight-level rating on a defendant based on prior convictions, which is inconsistent with the criteria under which he was sentenced.  To settle the SEC's case, the judge agreed to the entry of the final judgment, which orders a permanent injunction against future violations of the charged provisions, and ordered a three-tier sentencing rule. The final judgment orders a five year, seven year, and 12-month prison term."
