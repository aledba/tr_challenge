  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the family court that granted the parties joint custody and ordered Husband to pay $744 a month in child support.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Jersey on October 11, 2015, Husband sought a divorce from his wife on the basis of non-marital property. The court found that Husband's wife violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay a 35% discount to the value of a wife's share of the company where she was the majority and controlling shareholder.  The court also found Husband liable for his own attorney's fees.  In a parallel action, on October 13, 2016, the Honorable Kathleen A. McCole of the U. S. District court for New Jersey entered a judgment against Husband that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder. The judgment also prohibits Husband from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer or purchasing or selling any stock in a publicly-traded company without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  On October 12, 2019, the court issued a judgment ordering a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of both Husband and wife, and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a $132,656 civil penalty.  To settle the case, the Court also issued an order suspending the sale of the stock of Pure Country, Inc. (PCI) to a third party, who was not named in the order. The order also prohibits the purchase or sale of shares in a closely-held business for equitable distribution purposes when one spouse intends to retain ownership of the business.  It also requires that the company pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.8 million, which is less than the estate valuation or the $2 million value Wife's expert placed on the company's stock.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Fineman and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov."
