  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against William T. Walters for insider trading in Dean Foods, Inc., a Texas-based dairy and food company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 2011, Walters was convicted of insider trading based on material nonpublic information about a plan by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Darden Restaurants, Inc. (Darden) to acquire Darden. According to the complaint, Walters traded on the information in advance of the Darden announcement, and, in exchange for the information, Walters received a series of subpoenas for his phone records, bank records, trading records, and credit reports. The complaint alleges that Walters tipped the FBI about the potential impact of the information leaks on Darden's stock price, and that, contrary to the government\u2019s representations to the court, Walters did not share the information with the FBI. Instead, the complaint alleges, Walters provided the FBI with an account of his trading in Darden stock, which he then used to make approximately $1 million in profits. The SEC also obtained a court order requiring the FBI to submit a detailed summary of its findings to a trial judge, which Walters agreed to do. The court also issued a subpoena for the phone records and other records of Walters, which the SEC obtained through an internal investigation conducted by the Office of Professional Responsibility and the Department of Justice. The subpoena was unsealed on May 24, 2018, and the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Walters and ordered him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, Walters consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $25,352,490, plus prejudgment interests of $8,882,022.80. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Walters.  On May 26, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Walters, charging him with violating Section 17 (a)(1) of The Securities Act, Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The investigation was conducted by Matthew Thoreson and supervised by Daniel A. Levin of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by"
