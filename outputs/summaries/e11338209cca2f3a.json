  "summary": "On February 2, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri entered a final judgment against the City of Gladstone, Missouri, granting death and burial benefits under Missouri's Workers' Compensation Act to Donna Cheney on behalf of her deceased spouse, David Cheney. The Commission determined that David Cheney suffered a compensable injury by occupational exposure to carcinogenic smoke, fumes and particulates while working as a firefighter for the City to the development of his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). According to the Commission's order, in 2008 David Cheney was diagnosed with lung cancer and died of the disease on May 22, 2014. David Cheney's NHL was not the result of exposure to any known carcinogens, but rather a result of his work as a firefighter. The complaint further alleges that in 2008 Donna Cheney and two of David Cheney\u2019s former colleagues, Kenneth Potter and David Cline, raised the issue of compensation and whether there was sufficient evidence for the Commission to find a causal link between David Cheney and his NHL.  The complaint alleges that the Commission erred in awarding David Cheney workers' compensation benefits based on its finding that he was exposed to \"unknown carcinogens\" in the firefighting industry, including asbestos, benzene, black soot, and diesel exhaust.  David Cheney immediately began treatment and was not actively employed thereafter.  Donna Cheney was substituted as the claimant in this case.  In a parallel action, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against David Cheney for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David Lockey and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Messrs. Gibson, Lockey, Gibson, and Gibson. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri State Auditor's Office."
