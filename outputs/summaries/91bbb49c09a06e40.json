  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment in favor of a former high school classmate who was convicted of two felony counts of pre-arrest silence in connection with the shooting death of Edward Cobb.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 6, 2011, Spratlin and his then-girlfriend, Briana Abner, agreed to settle the charges by agreeing to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also granted the defendants the right to return to the United States to apply for a new trial.  In its order, the court also ordered the defendants to pay a $1,025 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the antiligence provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Mascianica of the Atlanta Regional Office with assistance from John Rymas of the Division of Criminal Investigations, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L.
