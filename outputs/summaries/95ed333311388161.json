  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants' motion for a reduced sentence.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that defendants Ronald Mack, Jesse Opher, and Hassan Hawkins violated the antifraud provisions of Section 404 of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Mack and Opher consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions of the securities laws, and from participating in any program that provides for the reduction of a defendant's mandatory minimum sentence. The court also found that the defendants were not eligible for relief under the First Step Act because they did not have the benefit of the reduced statutory penalties.  In addition, the court found that Mack, Opher and Hawkins violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions, and to pay a penalty equal to or greater than the amount of their sentence reduction. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 547 (Feb. 22, 2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
