  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska today entered a final judgment in favor of a settlement that permanently restrains the damages award against Lorena Weston.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Anchorage, Alaska, alleges that, in a car accident, Weston was injured when she slipped and fell on ice in the parking lot of a hotel parking lot and was taken to the Alaska Native Medical Center, where she underwent a complicated surgery.  According to the complaint, Weston sought to introduce evidence of her full, undiscounted medical bills after her medical care providers accepted less from Medicare as payment in full.

Weston also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security in connection with her claims for non-economic damages, and to be barred from associating with any third party that does not have a right of subrogation by law or contract.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the U. S. District court for the Central District of Florida entered a judgment against Weston that permanently enjoins her from violating the federal securities laws, orders her to return her passport, and requires her to submit a civil injunctive action against her employer, imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against her, and imposing a bar against her from appearing before the SEC as an attorney or practicing before the court as a lawyer.
