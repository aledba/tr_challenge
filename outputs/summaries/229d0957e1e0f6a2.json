  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a Texas-based arbitration firm in an action brought by SBS alleging that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that, in 2006, SBS and T3 entered into an arbitration agreement under which the parties agreed to pay $566,143.61 in prejudgment interest and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their commissions.  According to the complaint, the arbitration agreement provided that the parties had exclusive right to arbitrate and that the arbitrator had exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether the parties could recover future commissions from the parties.  In addition, the complaint alleges that SBS violated the arbitration provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to adequately consider the impact of the arbitration on the parties\u2019 respective claims.  For example, the SEC alleges that in 2014, a federal district court in Texas issued an order requiring SBS to submit to arbitration a judgment that permanently enjoins the parties from violating the federal arbitration provisions.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions. The settlement is subject to court approval.  SBS also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to pay civil penalties of $2,449,208.14 and $437,126.28, respectively. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.  It also acknowledges that the SEC has issued an Order requiring the parties to comply with the Commission on Arbitration Rules, which requires arbitration decisions to be made by the court at a reasonable time.  On August 2, 2016, the U. S. District Judge in Dallas granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against SBS from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordered SBS, T3, and the other parties to submit written judgments that affirm or reject the Commission's findings. The court also granted the defendants\u2019 requests for an injunction against further violations of the Commission Act, ordered the defendants to produce documents, and issued a civil injunctive order against each of them.  Finally, the court granted the parties a preliminary injunction against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The court ruled that the defendants violated Section 10"
