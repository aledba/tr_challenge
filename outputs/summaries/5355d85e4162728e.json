  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Lawrence C. Nixon, Jr., a convicted felon, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Nixon was convicted as charged by a jury in 2012 and sentenced to 20 years at hard labor, with the sentences running consecutively, and to pay a $15,000 fine. According to the complaint, Nixon consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The final judgment permanently enjoins Nixon from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of money he has already been ordered to pay. The court also granted Nixon a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any drug, including, without limitation, possession of a large amount of marijuana. The Court's order also prohibits Nixon from associating with any third party who has a history of drug-related criminal conduct, and from providing any assistance in the investigation of a criminal case. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Nixon. The SEC also announced related administrative proceedings against Nixon arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC's earlier criminal charges.  In its continuing investigation, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and other relief. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans."
