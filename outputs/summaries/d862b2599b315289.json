  "summary": "On March 6, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas entered a final judgment against Ford Motor Company v. Versata Software, Inc., a Texas-based software company, that permanently enjoins Ford from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and orders Ford to produce documents relevant to Versata's claims and defenses in the Michigan case.  The court also granted Ford's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  According to the court's order, on January 4, 2016, Ford served a subpoena to a Versata attorney, Neeraj Gupta, who was named as a defendant in the litigation.  In its order, the court found that the subpoena violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) of The Securities Act of 1933, and that the court ordered Versata to comply with the subpoena.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Ford consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requiring him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Versata also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay disgorgement of $1,078, which represents $2,098 in pre-judgment interest and a $500,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Franke and Christopher Peavler, and supervised by Scott Cole and Jan Folena of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Franke. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Attorney General's Office, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Versata for its role in a multi-year securities fraud scheme.
