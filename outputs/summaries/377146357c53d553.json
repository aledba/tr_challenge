  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming today entered a temporary restraining order against a Wyoming-based Forest Service agency and a Wyoming state agency in an emergency action to transfer an elk feedground to Wyoming.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Wyoming, alleges that the Forest Service issued a special-use permit for the Wyoming Department of Agriculture to conduct a supplemental feeding program for wild elk in the Bridger-Teton National Forest.  According to the complaint, the federal agency issued the permit without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In its order, the court found that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder, and that it was not competent to deal with the issues at hand in this matter.  Further, the Court found that, contrary to what the complaint alleges, the agency did not seek to transfer the feedground for the purpose of preventing elk from roaming onto private lands and damaging stored crops.  As a result of the court's action, the SEC's order to halt the expedited processing of the emergency action against the agency, and the issuance of an emergency court order, permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million.  On the same day that the court granted the emergency court's order, it issued an order temporarily freezing the defendants' assets, freezing their assets, and appointing a receiver to oversee the emergency relief efforts.  Without admitting to these violations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions, ordering them to comply with the court orders, and ordering the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver.   The court also granted the receiver's request for an asset freeze and other emergency relief. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wyoming Secretary of State's Office, the Colorado Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Utah Department of Natural Resources, the Montana Department of Health and Human Services, the Arizona Department of Wildlife, and other state agencies."
