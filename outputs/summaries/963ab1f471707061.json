  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against Demetrius Catching, Jr., a Kentucky resident, for violating the terms of his supervised release.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on April 11, 2018, Catching was stopped for driving 65 m.p.h. in violation of the supervised release provisions of the federal securities laws. Catching allegedly told the officers that he had marijuana in the back seat of the rental car, and that he knew that Catching had used the drug. The complaint further alleges that the officers found approximately $2,100 in cash in the console between the driver and passenger seats of the car. According to the complaint, the officers did not find any evidence to support their findings, and Catching agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the federal drug laws and ordered to pay a penalty of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. The SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in federal district court in Kentucky, charges Catching with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The court also issued a temporary restraining order against Catching and ordered him to surrender his passport.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Kentucky today announced criminal charges against Whitehead, who was also charged with possession of marijuana.  On May 21, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against CATCH, charging him with a felony for possession of a controlled substance. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, CATCH consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay $1,000 in restitution. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release No. 1787165 (Aug. 21, 2009).  The case is being supervised by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy S. Cotter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kentucky Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
