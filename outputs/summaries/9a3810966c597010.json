  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against a defendant who agreed to suppress evidence obtained from an illegal CSLI search of his home.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that, on June 26, 2008, a Brockton, Massachusetts man and his best friend, Josener Dorisca, engaged in a series of illegal searches and seizures, including one that resulted in the seizure of a large amount of cocaine and cash. The complaint alleges that the defendants' consent to the search was obtained through the use of information obtained from the illegal search. According to the complaint, however, the defendant's consent was not affected by the illegal searches, as the complaint alleges, because the evidence obtained during the unlawful search was the result of the unlawful possession of the drugs by the police. The SEC also alleges that Cassio's consent to a search was not influenced by the unlawful seizure of the drug. Instead, the SEC alleges, the defendants knew from the outset that the search had been conducted by private citizen rather than police, and that the officers had access to the drug evidence in the crawl space where the drugs were found. The court also found that the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy when confronted with the evidence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On August 2, 2018, the U. S. Attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York announced criminal sanctions against the individual accused of the alleged drug-trafficking and related violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the officer-in-charge provision of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. The Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-officer bar against Cassio. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Boston Police Department, the Massachusetts State Corporation Commission, the Connecticut Department of Banking and Securities, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Police Department and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
