  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against D&J Commercial Properties LLC, the owner of the Homer, La., shopping center, and EMC Property & Casualty, its owner, for summary judgment in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Iberia, Louisiana, alleges that on a Friday morning in June 2016, Betty Laffitte and her sister, Debra Plunkett, went to the Bill's Dollar Store in Homer to use the handicap parking lot. The complaint alleges that the ramp at the end of each island was so that tractors could get onto the raised portion and mow the grass. According to the complaint, the ramp was entirely open and obvious, and that nobody had ever fallen on the ramp. The SEC also alleges that a licensed civil engineer who had been a tenant since 2005, watched the construction of the parking lot in 2006, and purchased the shopping center in 2015, giving him sufficient time to be charged with knowledge of the issue. The court also granted summary judgment against the defendants.  In its order granting summary judgment, the SEC alleges that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a penalty equal to the amount of their profits. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 2317.1.  This case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
