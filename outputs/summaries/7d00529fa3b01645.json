The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that, in 2010, Farzad Etemad Amini and Pouneh Beizai approached HMDG, Inc. (\"HMDG\") about remodeling their home.  According to the complaint, the defendants agreed to arbitration based on a clause in the arbitration agreement that requires the parties to submit their disputes to arbitration in accordance with the agreed-upon procedures for selecting an arbitrator.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to establish the existence of a valid arbitration agreement and failed to inform the arbitrator that the arbitration clause did not apply to all of the parties' claims.

The judgment also ordered the parties not to violate the arbitration provisions of the proposed arbitration agreement, and to pay attorney fees in the amounts of $1,430 each.  Finally, the Court issued an Order suspending the Defendants' motion to compel arbitration, ordering the arbitration proceedings to be conducted by a neutral arbitrator, and appointing a third party to arbitrate the matter.
