  "summary": "On August 4, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Darnell Williams, a former Army officer who was convicted of felony domestic battery.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Williams violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Williams was arrested on December 26, 2016 and sentenced to 18 months of intensive domestic violence probation. The SEC alleges that defendant and his wife, Angela Rush, had been married for five years but had not lived together since 2013. The complaint alleges that, on the night of the alleged incident, defendant and Rush engaged in a verbal altercation and demanded that the court issue an order suspending the order of protection. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Williams to return to the United States.  In a parallel action, on July 1, 2017 in federal district court for the Central District of New York, Williams pleaded guilty to one count of felonious battery and was ordered to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On July 2, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action against Williams, charging him with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"). The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties against Williams. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Chicago Regional Office.  A hearing is scheduled for August 5, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-12-3.2(a)(1) (West) (January 17, 2013). The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
