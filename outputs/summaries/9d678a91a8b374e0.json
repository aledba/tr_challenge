  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Gilbert Garcia, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to five years in prison and ordered to pay $6,407.22 in restitution.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on September 22, 2016, Garcia entered into a contract for deed with the Marshalls pursuant to which he would pay the sale price of $15,000, plus interest, taxes, and insurance in monthly installments over five years.  According to the complaint, Garcia purchased items for his personal use or consumption such as food, drinks, restaurant gift cards, children's toys, tools, and batteries, which he did not believe met the contract\u2019s requirement that the purchases be materials for the property.  Garcia also allegedly spent over $10,000 to acquire a power worm drive saw and an air compressor for $189.05.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Garcia.  On November 30, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Garcia, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Garcia consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a total of $5,407, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,137.91, a civil penalty of five years, and a $1 million officer-and-director bar.  Additionally, the judgment orders Garcia to pay restitution in a amount that is not supported by the record, even after Marshall reiterated that he was not allowed under the contract to charge such items and Garcia apologized for doing so, and to pay an $8,000 civil penalty in the amount of $6.407, a total amount equal to the amount that Garcia has already paid to the court.   The court also ordered Garcia to disgorge $1.137 million in stolen property that he received from his mother, who was the rightful owner of the property at the time of the alleged theft, and pay a $5 million officer and director bar in a civil proceeding.  Finally, the court granted the court's motion for a temporary restraining order against Garcia and ordered him to return the stolen property to his mother. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. "
