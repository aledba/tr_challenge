  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois on May 28, 2015, entered a final judgment against a former state's attorney for the Chicago Police Department that permanently enjoined her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, alleges that Gildardo Sierra of the Department of Justice and the Chicago State's Attorney's Office improperly appointed a special prosecutor to investigate and prosecute the shooting of his son, Flint Farmer, in 2011.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that Sierra followed the defendant out of court, hid behind some potted plants, and contacted police to inform them that he was driving without a license.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, that the Special Prosecutor's Office did not have sufficient evidence to determine whether or not Sierra acted unreasonably when she fired the final three shots at Flint.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against Emmett, charging him with violating Section 3-9008 of the federal securities laws, and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Complaint or in the Commission's Order, Sierra consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) and(e) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and orders her to pay disgorgement of her ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against her from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Office of Inspector General, and the Illinois State Auditor's Office in this matter."
