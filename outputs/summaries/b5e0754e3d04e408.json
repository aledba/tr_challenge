  "summary": "On April 18, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Meridian Security Insurance Company (Meridian) in a civil injunctive action brought by the victims of an automobile accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Franklin County, New York, alleges that Meridian, as an insurer of the defendant, the estate of TJay Klamm, had the duty to stack the bodily injury liability limits of a policy covering four automobiles as a result of a collision in which Klamm was involved when driving one of the automobiles, resulting in the deaths of the plaintiffs, Richard Kiselewski and Sierra Hess, and in serious injuries to the plaintiff, Meadow Hess.  In its judgment, the court held that there was no ambiguity in the policy as to whether the limits on the Cobalt could be stacked with the liability limits for the other vehicles listed on the policy.  According to the SEC's order, however, there is an ambiguity in how the limits are stacked.  For example, the SEC alleges that there is no ambiguity where the relevant limits for each vehicle can be stacked together, and that the \"TOTAL LIMIT FOR BODILY INJURY\" limit on each vehicle is the maximum permissible limit for the vehicle covered by the policy at the time of the accident. The SEC also alleges that, in a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Klamm.  On May 25, 2018, a federal district court in New York granted Meridian's motion for summary judgment in favor of the injured and injured, and ordered the company to pay a civil penalty of $100,000 per person and $1.2 million per accident, for a total of $400,000 for each injury sustained by Klamm in the automobile accident that occurred on April 17, 2015, on Illinois Route 148 near the boundary between Franklin County and Jefferson County.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Meridian has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders that the amount of any civil penalty to be determined by the court at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Meridian has also agreed to pay $1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  A hearing on May 24, 2018 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m."
