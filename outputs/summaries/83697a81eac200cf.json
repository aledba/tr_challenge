  "summary": "On July 31, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against JH Construction, Inc. (\"JH\"), a Tennessee-based manufacturer and distributor of engineered wood siding products.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, charges JH with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  JH's complaint also alleges that JH misrepresented to prospective customers that its products were engineered to withstand damage from woodpeckers.  According to the complaint, JH falsely claimed in its marketing materials that the woodpecker was \"OSB Siding\" when, in fact, it was not.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to the representations in the marketing materials, the Woodpecker is not a product specific to JH and JH.  It is a product group that includes LP's products, and that it has only recently started its \"No Wood Is Good\" advertising campaign.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering JH to pay $1.5 million in disgorge interest, $1 million in civil penalties, and a $100,000 civil penalty.  On August 13, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Memphis, Tennessee, alleging that, among other things, that the defendants violated the anti-dumping provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and (d) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants.   The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
