  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on June 15, 2015 entered a final judgment against a former Michigan attorney who allegedly engaged in online harassment in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Michigan, alleges that John C. Crisler violated Section 750 of the Exchange Act by making a series of unprovoked and unsophisticated posts on the internet, including one that allegedly targeted a well-known Buddhist religious leader.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that Crisler engaged in a pattern and course of unconsented contact with the victim, including sending her an e-mail expressing his dissatisfaction with her representation during the criminal proceedings.  In addition, the SEC alleges that, in addition to violating Section 750, Crisler also violated Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and Section 14(a)(2)(A)(2) of The Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Crisler from violating MCL 750.411s and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, which will be offset by a civil monetary penalty of $5,000.  On June 16, 2016, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois announced criminal charges against Crisler.  To learn more about online harassment, see Litigation Release No. 13-20-2016.  For more information on online harassment and how to protect yourself from it, see Cyberstalking by Proxy.  Cyberstalk by proxy is a form of online harassment that is defined by the First Amendment as:  Cyberbullying, cyberstalking, and Facebook stalking.   The complaint also charges Crisler with violating Section 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The court also ordered Crisler to comply with the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 12(b).  In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained a court order halting the dissemination of false and misleading information about the victims of online stalking, and ordering the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter.  It also ordered that the court determine whether to impose a permanent injunction against further dissemination of information concerning the victims' alleged misconduct.  Finally, the Court issued an order requiring the SEC to provide a copy of the complaint to the court"
