  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in a civil injunctive action brought by a group of community members who are seeking to have the Library of Congress (DCPL) re-opened as part of a $4.5 million renovation project.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington D.C. on November 6, 2017, the District Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Washington announced that it had obtained an emergency court order halting the renovation of the library.  The complaint alleges that DCPL violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the books and services provision of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, DCPL consented to the entry of a final judgement that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the relief sought.  In addition, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval, and ordered the library to comply with the court's order.  On November 8, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, charging DCPL with violations of the federal securities laws. The complaint also alleges that, in a parallel action, the Attorney General's Office filed an emergency action against DCPL, charging the library with violating the anti-discrimination provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order requiring the Library to provide interim services to certain residents of the district. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Gavilan and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, and other emergency relief agencies."
