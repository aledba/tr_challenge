  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the United States seeking the return of a Colombian citizen who was unlawfully removed from her country of habitual residence.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the father, who was also charged in the case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia on October 19, 2017, Johan Calixto and his wife, Hadylle Lesmes, agreed to settle the case by agreeing to the entry of a final Judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000.  In addition, the court granted the father and Ms. Lesmes' requests for an expedited hearing to determine whether to proceed with the repatriation of M.A.Y. from Colombia to the U. States.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Calixtos and Lesmes consented to entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordering them to comply with the entry and enjoin them from further violations.  Separately, the Court granted the mother's request for a preliminary injunction and ordered the father to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount owed to the mother in the alternative, and ordered him to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office, and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of International Affairs. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Advocacy and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment in a real estate development project.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.
