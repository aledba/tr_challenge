  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a preliminary injunction against the implementation of a federal law that requires states to collect fees related to the transportation of hazardous materials by rail.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that California Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law a provision of the federal anti-fraud law, the Interstate Transportation and Safety Act, in 1990. The complaint alleges that Brown violated Section 5125(f)(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act by failing to provide sufficient information to determine whether a state or federal agency could impose a fair fee on a company that transported hazardous materials. Brown agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws. Brown also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval.  According to the SEC's order, Brown violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) and (a)(3) of this federal law, and the preemption provision of \u00a75125. The final judgment orders Brown to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Brown.  On May 3, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered a final injunction against Brown and ordered Brown to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Brown consented to a final judgement that permanently restrains the jurisdiction of the court. The court also granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order against Brown, and issued an order suspending Brown from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney. The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Scott A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Transportation, the Department of Homeland Security, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service and the California Office of Inspector General."
