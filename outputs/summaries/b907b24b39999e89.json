  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Missouri announced today that it has filed a civil injunctive action against Marvin Maggard, a former member of the group who was charged with second-degree murder and armed criminal action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, alleges that Appellant asked for and received an instruction on use of force in defense of another person.  According to the complaint, Maggard and his friend, Jovan Tucker, were present at the time of the alleged shooting when the group met and discussed the events that had just transpired.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that, as a result of this conduct, the defendant was not entitled to a defense-of-others instruction when he was confronted by a group of men who demanded that he surrender his gun and surrender.   The complaint further alleges that when confronted by the men, Appelant replied, \u201cI trump you.\u201d    Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Central District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Maggard for his role in the scheme of the scheme.
