  "summary": "On September 15, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan entered a final judgment against Honeywell International, Inc. (\"Honeywell\") and its former CEO, Richard Atwood, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, between 2003 and 2011, Honeywell and Atwood engaged in a series of contract negotiations in which they agreed to pay a premium to retirees who did not pay the full premium.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of these negotiations, the defendants were not entitled to lifetime health care benefits.  In addition, the complaint alleges, as alleged in the complaint, that the defendants failed to account for the costs of retirees' health care coverage and failed to consider the impact on retirees' retirement savings on those retirees.  For example, the SEC alleges that in one of the negotiations, Atwood allegedly told retirees that they could not afford to pay the premium when the contract was due to expire on January 1, 2016.  At the time of the litigation, however, the court had not previously issued a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
