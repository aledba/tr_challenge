  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Utah today entered final judgments against a former commercial truck driver who claimed that he was exposed to \"high levels of carbon monoxide\" due to a work accident that occurred in October 2013 while driving a truck.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Salt Lake City, Utah, Timothy Foye, a truck driver, alleged that, in May 2014, Kodiak Fresh Produce, LLC (Kodiak), a commercial truck company, issued a medical panel report concluding that he suffered permanent brain damage from exposure to high levels of CO.  The complaint alleges that the panel's report, which was not well-taken, was not consistent with the recommendations of the medical panel.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that one of the panelists had been trained by a board certified neurologist, and that he had been exposed to CO through his work accident.  Without admitting or denying the findings of the report, the Board consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the Board from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the Board to appoint a new medical panel to evaluate the merits of the claims.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Bade-Brown of the Salt Lake Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Utah Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
