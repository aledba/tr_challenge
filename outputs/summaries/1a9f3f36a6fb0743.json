  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered final judgments against providers of durable medical equipment and supplies (DME) to Medicaid recipients.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that the Department of Health and Human Services violated the antifraud provisions of Section 50(24) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 50b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the DME requires that providers of DME provide timely and accurate documentation of their claims to the federal government. The complaint alleges that, in 2016, the Department issued an administrative decision finding that DME had not complied with the requirements of the federal law and that it was entitled to recouped overpayments made to DME providers. DME also requires providers to provide documentation of the diagnosis, medical necessity, and length of need, which is not supported by the evidence presented in the complaint.  In addition, the complaint alleges the Department failed to provide sufficient documentation to support its determination of whether DME should be entitled to a fair hearing within seventy-five days of receipt of the Department\u2019s final decision.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Great Plains consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $96,140. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 29, 2017, the court granted the SEC's request for an administrative proceeding against Great Plains, which would determine whether to proceed with the litigation.  Great Plains agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the securities laws, ordering it to submit a written response to the Commission's order, and requiring it to provide a fair process for disputing the Department's findings. The Commission also agreed to a settlement that would require Great Plains to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the Commission. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Stalcup and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Melissa Hauer. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
