  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia today entered final judgments against two hospitals for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in West Virginia, alleges that, in August 2012, the National Nurses Organization Committee (NRA) issued an order requiring the hospitals to bargain in good faith with the union in order to obtain preliminary injunctive relief. According to the complaint, the hospital and its bargaining representative, Michelle Mahon, repeatedly complained to the NRA that the hospitals were stonewalling and refusing to bargain. The complaint further alleges that the nurses were leaving the hospital because of the hospital\u2019s alleged violations of the collective bargaining provisions of the federal securities laws. The NRA also alleged that, earlier in the year, an Ohio jury had returned an $800,000 verdict against Affinity Medical Center, another Community Health Systems hospital, on an employee's defamation claim. The court found that, absent preliminary injunctions, the hospitals and the union would likely be unable to bargain effectively under a Board order. In addition, the complaint alleges that certain nurses had expressed \"frustrat[ing] with the fact that it's taking so long to get a contract\" and that some of the nurses had been replaced by licensed practical nurses in an effort to undercut the union.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General (OIG) today announced that it has issued an alert warning registered nurses to be aware of any potential adverse impact on their ability to bargain with the employer. The OIG's complaint charges the hospitals with violating the anti-discrimination provisions of Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(5) and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties. The UIG's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Muffley and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the UIG, the Ohio Department of Health, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
