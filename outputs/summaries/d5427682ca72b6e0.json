  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against Ohio State Trooper Christopher B. Stout for negligent infliction of emotional distress.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dayton, Ohio, alleges that Stout violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder.  According to the complaint, Stout, while a patient at the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA), was repeatedly subjected to nonconsensual sexual contact and offensive touching of a sexual nature by a licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) at a government health facility.  Stout also alleges that Poling told co-workers that she was dating a patient and failed to follow through on their attempts to take him to an emergency room or to alert the appropriate authorities.  As alleged in Stout\u2019s complaint, Poling continued to make unwanted telephone and personal contact and unwanted sexual advances towards Stout after he was released from the hospital.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s action, Stout consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Stout arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On January 6, 2017, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans granted the SEC\u0092s request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, ordering Stout to pay disgorgement of $2,500, and prejudgment interest of $100,000 in a civil action brought by the District of Columbia, and ordering Poling to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $75,000 for a total of $7,500.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 8, 2017.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 527, 527 (6th Cir. 1997).  The Commission on Inspector General's Complaint against Stout also issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an officer or director of a public health institution.   The complaint also names as a relief defendant Poling, who was previously barred by the Commission from appearing and practicing before a federal court as a result of his alleged misconduct. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission has issued an Order suspending Stout from appearing, practicing, or practicing in the public health field.
