  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a husband accused of defrauding his wife out of more than $6,000.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, on January 24, 2015, the husband and his wife filed a civil injunctive action against the court, alleging that the court improperly issued an order requiring the husband to pay $2,000 in counsel fees in the full amount of the wife's request.  The complaint alleges that the husband entered the residence before the court issued the order and, after the court directed him to pay the disputed expenses, entered an order directing him to make a second counsel fee installment payment on the same property.  As alleged in the complaint, the court then denied the husband's request for a money judgment and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, however, the defendant has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to disgorge $3,600 in ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and pay a civil penalty of $1,700.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California today entered a judgment against the husband in contempt of court for failing to pay his counsel fees.  On January 26, 2020, the Court granted the wife a temporary restraining order and ordered her to surrender her separate property to the husband.  A hearing is scheduled for May 21, 2020.  For further information, see Matter of Chichra v. Parnes, 100 A.D.3d 934, 937, 837 N.Y.S.-2d 206, and Matter of Schlegel v. Braunstein, 102 B.C. 3d 919, 932, 865 N. Y.S-2d 207, and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-3 thereunder.  An SEC order appointing a receiver for the husband will determine the amount of disgorgement and civil penalties to be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Alan D. Scheinkman and Carol Jaffe of the New York office, with assistance from Joseph G. Sansone of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and Antonia Chion of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U."
