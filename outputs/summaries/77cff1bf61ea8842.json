  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Chris Colbey d/b/a TimberPro Land Clearing for breach of contract.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Colbey and his company, Reynolds Forestry Consulting and Real Estate, PLLC, executed a \"Mechanical Site Preparation 2014 Contract\" in which Colbey agreed to clear and prepare several tracts of forest land for reforestation beginning at \"no later than July 15, 2014,\" and ending at \"No later than December 31, 2014.\" Colbey allegedly told Reynolds that he was not going to pay for the work that he did on the Nevada 411 tract, and that he had to use his heavy equipment on the site to prepare the tracts.  According to the complaint, however, Colbey continued to withhold payment because of his violation of the contract, and Reynolds had to hire a contractor to do the work.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Colbey.  Colbey has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $123,673, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $19,500.  Reynolds has also agreed to pay a $20,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Reynolds has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  On September 10, 2014, the court granted Reynolds' motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered him to comply with the court's order, and ordered Reynolds to pay $44,716 in civil penalties and to pay an attorney's fee in the amount of $'123,622. The court also granted Reynolds the right to request an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 206(3).  The case was handled by John B. Dozier of the SEC Enforcement Division's Fort Worth Regional Office, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The case was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
