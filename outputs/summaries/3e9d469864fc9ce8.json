  "summary": "On January 24, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a Philadelphia-area food service work manager who was found to have engaged in a pattern of stealing company time.  According to the court's order, on May 3, 2017, a co-worker confronted Claimant and asked her to clock her out at the end of the work day.  Claimant allegedly replied that she did not steal company time and instead used the last four digits of her social security number provided to her by her employer to clock herself out.  The court also found that, contrary to the Board's finding, Claimant did not violate the company's policy of not requiring employees to report to work on time, and did not inform her supervisor that she was running late.  In addition, the court found that Claimant was being terminated for falsification of company records, which was the basis for her discharge, and that her refusal to return her rental car and pick up her personal vehicle constituted willful misconduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the employer has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from denying or denying benefits to any employee, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Walker and Mr. Mascianica of the Market Abuse Unit. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The investigation was supervised by Amy C. Hershfang, Chief of the Office of Compliance, and Antonia Chion.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Office of Insurance Regulation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
