  "summary": "On February 4, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas entered a final judgment against a former Dollar General employee who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that Sheena Carter used a Taser to commit an aggravated robbery in May 2015 and demanded the employees hand over cash from the safe. The complaint alleges that Carter used the Taser because she was fearful the robber would hurt her and Sanders if they did not give the robber the money. According to the complaint, Carter did not use the weapon when she committed the robbery, but rather after she and Sanders had already had Sanders and Reyes give her the money from the Dollar General safe. Carter's complaint also alleges that after the officers confronted Carter, Carter took out a taser and showed it to Sanders, who believed that the robber was going to tase her. The court ultimately ruled that Carter could not be required to register as a violent offender under the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Carter. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Carter, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against her from future violations of the securities laws, as well as a preliminary injunction against future violations.  On January 3, 2020, the Court of Appeals issued an order suspending Carter from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of 36 months in the amount of $1,000,000. Carter consented to the order, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and orders her to be enjoined from future securities law violations. The order also prohibits her from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The Court also ordered Carter to pay disgorgement of her ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500. Carter also agreed to the appointment of a receiver to facilitate the transfer of assets from her criminal conviction to her current criminal conviction. The Commission of Inquiry that led to the Commission's finding against Carter has issued an Order suspending her from appearing, practicing, or appearing before the Commission of an Attorney. The Order also requires her to provide a copy of the complaint to the SEC."
