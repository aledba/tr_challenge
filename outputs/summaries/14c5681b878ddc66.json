  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against a former employee of the United States Postal Service for filing an administrative complaint against the agency.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on June 17, 2017, Paulette Williams, a Postal Service employee, was denied the opportunity to work on and after December 15, 2015, even though she had requested a reasonable accommodation of her physical disability.  The complaint alleges that Williams, who is a registered representative of the Postal Service, withdrew her administrative complaint on February 4, 2016, less than 180 days after the agency announced it would not allow her to return to work.  Williams also alleges that, when Williams returned to work about two months later, the agency again denied her request to seek a final disposition of her complaint.  As alleged in the complaint, Williams then filed an amended complaint, this time alleging that the agency violated the federal registration provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that, in addition to failing to comply with the registration provision of the Exchange Act, Williams failed to adequately disclose to the agency that she had filed a complaint with the agency in 2015.  In addition, Williams alleges that she failed to satisfy the jurisdictional exhaustion requirement when she filed her amended complaint and, at the same time, filed an administrative action against a postal service employee for failing to timely respond to her request for an accommodation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's opinion, Williams consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and orders Williams to pay disgorgement of her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest of $2,500, and imposes a $25,000 civil penalty.  On August 9, 2017 the Court granted Williams's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered her to respond to a written complaint filed by the Commission in the same fashion as the complaint against Williams.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maryland Office of Inspector General, and the Maryland Department of Health and Human Services in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Office of Compliance has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone filing an emergency action with the Commission by using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0"
