  "summary": "On July 23, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Oracle USA, Inc. (\"Oracle\") and its former CEO, Seth Ravin, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Ravin and Oracle from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the Exchange Act and ordering him to pay $28,502,246.40 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the court's order, Ravin consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Oracle for its alleged copyright infringement.  Oracle agreed to settle the charges against it by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the issuance of a $35.6 million civil penalty.  Ravin also agreed to pay a $20,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Oracle with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint also charges Ravin with violating Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 10b2-1 and Rule 15a-2 thereunder, and with violating Exchange Act Rule 15b-3.  Without admitting to these violations, Oracle has agreed to a settlement where it will pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of the civil money it has already paid to the receiver of the alleged infringement. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael R. Karpel and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Office of Financial Regulation in this matter."
