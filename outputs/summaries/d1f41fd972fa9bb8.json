  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Sotheby's, Inc. (\"Sotheby\"), a New York-based auction house, and its owner, Peter L. Barnet, for violating the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 11, 2018, one business day prior to the scheduled auction, Defendant sent a Demand Letter in response to a letter from Greece stating that the Bronze Horse had been illegally removed from Greece and should be repatriated.  The complaint alleges that the letter was sent in fulfillment of a government mandate to protect the heritage of Greece, and that the figure was worth millions of dollars.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the letter did not involve any legitimate claim of ownership, and instead was sent by a private individual who claimed ownership of the bronze horse.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders Sothebys to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, that Defendant violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order suspending the sale of any remaining Bronze Horse in the country.   In its complaint, the SEC also seeks a preliminary injunction, an order requiring the auction house to repatriate the bronze Horse, and, in a related action, a court order prohibiting the sale or purchase of any other Bronze Horse.  Finally, the complaint seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions, an accounting of the alleged losses, and the return of the stolen bronze horse with interest in the future.
