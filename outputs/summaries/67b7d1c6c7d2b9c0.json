  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against Charles E. Pillon, Jr., a King County, Washington resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, Washington, alleges that, between February 25, 2015 and February 24, 2016, Pillon engaged in the business of wrecking vehicles and dumping solid waste on his property in violation of the Hazardous Waste Management Act of 1940.  According to the complaint, while Pillon was storing and disposing of the waste, he failed to disclose that he was dumping the waste in decrepit containers that posed an imminent and substantial risk to the environment.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Pillon did not have a permit or a license to store or dispose of hazardous waste, and neither did he have a right to a fair trial.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The judgment also prohibits Pillon from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any security or other security measure. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 11, 2020).  The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On March 27, 2020, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against Pillon and ordered him to surrender his passport. The court granted the request for a temporary restraining order, ordered Pillon to pay $10 million in restitution, and issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Seattle Police Department, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
