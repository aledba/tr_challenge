  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against the city of Columbia in a civil injunctive action brought by an injured government employee.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Columbia, alleges that the Compensation Review Board (CRB) erred in modifying the attorney's fee award, arguing, inter alia, that: (1) the Office of Risk Management (ORM) did not have the authority under the CMPA to promulgate rules regarding Department of Employment Services (DOES) public sector hearings and adjudications; (2) the rule regarding attorney-fee awards was improperly applied retroactively to petitioner's pending fee application; and (3) even if ORM had the statutory authority to determine when and to what extent a claimant could receive an award of attorney's fees, the rule did not reference ORM at the time it renders its decision. (4) the CRB's decision to modify the fee award did not satisfy the requirements for an emergency rulemaking. (5) ORM failed to properly promulgate or extend its \u201cemergency\u201d rules.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Commission has agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins ORM from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders ORM to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Personnel Regulation (OPR) today announced that it has issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an attorney fee to a government employee who has been injured during the course of his or her employment.  According to the Commission's order, the receiver will determine the amount of attorney fees to be paid in a lump sum within 30 days after the date of the compensation order. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation was conducted by David A. Kasper and supervised by Marc Blau of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by David Kasper.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the District Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the United States Secret Service."
