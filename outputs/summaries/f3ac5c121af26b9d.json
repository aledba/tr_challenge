  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Pennsylvania yesterday entered a final judgment against Orlando Francisco Durazo, Jr., a Pennsylvania man who was sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison for his role in a 2017 car crash that injured a five-week old baby.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Allentown, Pennsylvania, alleges that Appellant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in imposing the sentence, the court failed to consider the severity of the injuries to the baby, the nature and severity of his injuries, and the role of a caregiver.  According to the complaint, the defendant was babysitting the baby when the trial court imposed an unreasonable sentence on him.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed by M.P.'s cousin, L.S., the baby suffered severe head, neck and eye injuries and was unable to walk or stand.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint filed in the federal district court in Philadelphia, the judge granted the court's request for a temporary restraining order, a temporary injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  On November 8, 2018, the Court granted the Court's motion for a preliminary injunction, imposed a 10-year prison sentence, and ordered the release of all of the injured children, including the five week old victim, to be immediately followed by an examination of the baby's brain, which was performed by a licensed clinical trial physician.  A hearing on November 9, 2018 was conducted by Deborah Esernio-Jenssen, an expert in child abuse pediatrics, and was supervised by Paul G. Sansone, Chief of the Department of Justice's Philadelphia Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
