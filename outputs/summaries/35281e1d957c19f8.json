  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against CalSTRS Board of Directors member Jose A. Duarte, finding that he was not qualified to receive disability retirement benefits because he failed to attend three independent medical examinations.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Stockton, California on April 14, 2010, Duarte told the court that he had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and was \"totally disabled with respect to working as a teacher.\"  The complaint further alleges that Duarte failed to provide sufficient medical documentation to support his claim.  Duarte's complaint alleges that, despite repeated requests to attend the three independent examinations, CalStRS had not received all of the necessary documentation to determine whether he had a pre-existing condition.  In addition, according to the complaint, as a result of his refusal to attend those examinations, the agency was unable to make an independent determination on whether Duarte was eligible for disability benefits.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the complaint charges Duarte with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 24103 of the Education Code and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Leiberman and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Central California and the California Department of Health and Human Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
