  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bridgeport, Connecticut, alleges that, on September 6, 2009, Jihad Clemons and Craig Waddell devised a plan to rob a drug dealer named Robert Taylor of his money, drugs, cell phone, and car. They discussed their plan with their friends, Hank Palmer and Michael Lomax, who agreed to join them in the robbery. The complaint alleges that the defendants agreed to use a nine millimeter handgun to commit the robbery, and that, in the course of the robbery and immediate flight from the scene of the crime, the defendant agreed and specifically intended that he or another participant in the robber would be armed with a deadly weapon. The SEC alleges that this finding was consistent with the jury instructions in the trial court's judgment, which required the defendant to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had committed the robbery with the intent to use the deadly weapon, that the jury had failed to instruct the defendant on the essential element of the alleged robbery, that he had agreed to commit a larceny, that there was a reasonable basis for a jury to find him guilty of a serious and manifest injustice, that a jury should determine whether the defendant was liable under the plain error doctrine.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and impose a civil penalty of $250,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against Clemons. The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations, and Assistant Director of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Connecticut Department of Justice, and the Connecticut State Corporation Commission in this matter."
