  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the New York State Department of Health (DOH) and its New York-based counterpart in a related administrative proceeding.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, on July 1, 2013, the Governor signed Executive Order 38, requiring the DOH to develop and implement a series of rules designed to protect the interests of the state's health care providers.  The order also required that the state health commissioner, the Secretary of State's Office, and the Department of Public Health (DOH) review and approve the subject regulations.  In addition, the court found that the directive did not apply to all of the entities that received state funds for health-related services, including nursing homes and doctors' offices.  Rather, the complaint alleges that the Governor and DOH acted far beyond the reach of their constitutional and statutory powers.  For example, as set forth in the complaint, the order required that certain state agencies impose limitations on executive compensation and administrative expenditures when utilizing State funds, and that the Secretary's Office and Department of Education had the authority to impose those limitations.  As set forth, however, the directive specifically prohibited the Governor from imposing those limitations on the entities receiving state funds from certain agencies, and instead directed the Secretary to determine the appropriate amount of funds to be distributed among the affected entities.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the secretary consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the Defendants from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also issued an order freezing the assets of the defendants and ordering the destruction of any evidence that may have been obtained in connection with the alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.
