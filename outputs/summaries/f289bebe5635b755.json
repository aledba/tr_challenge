  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against two Greenville residents for their roles in an alleged drainage easement fraud.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that J.A. McNeil and John William Mayton violated a restrictive covenant and interfered with express or prescriptive drainage easements when she blocked a PVC pipe that emptied water from their lots onto her property.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to establish the existence of a \"reciprocal easement\" or a \"prescriptive easement.\"  The complaint alleges that the defendants' use of the PVC pipe caused water to back up into their yards, which led to several weeks of standing water and significant damage to their lawns.  In a parallel action, on October 26, 2014, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal and state laws.  On November 19, 2015, the chancellor issued a final judgment ordering the defendants to comply with the court's order, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Oliver and McNeil consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal, state, and local laws, and orders them to jointly and severally disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  McNeil also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Mayton and Mayton agreed to settle the case by consenting to entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations, ordering him to pay civil penalties of $250,000, and ordering him not to participate in the issuance or purchase of any securities in the future.  Oliver agreed to a settlement where he would be permanently enjoined from violating any of the above-mentioned provisions of federal law.  He also agreed that he would pay a $50,000 civil penalty, which would be offset by the amount of his attorney's fees.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-1 (July 25, 2015).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Ms. Gibson is supervising the litigation."
