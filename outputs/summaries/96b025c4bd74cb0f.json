  "summary": "On October 22, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against Jeffrey M. Sondel, a New York-based immigration lawyer, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

According to the order, the court also issued a temporary suspension order suspending SONDELL for conduct that was inconsistent with the facts of the case, including that he was not prepared and had not read certain documents, and that he would need 10 minutes for closing argument to convince the court that he understood the gravity of the offense.
