  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against Duke Energy Corporation and certain of its officers and directors for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Duke Energy and its officers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the company violated the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors.  According to the complaint, Duke Energy agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Duke Energy also agreed to pay a $2.5 million civil penalty and a $6.8 million fine to the state, and to pay $24 million in remediation expenses.

Additionally, the order requires Duke Energy's officers and director bars to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any oil, gas, or coal-related product for a period of five years, and orders the company not to engage in any enforcement actions that may be deemed \"diligent\" or \"comprehensive.\"  The order also requires the defendants to show cause and effect, including compliance with federal and state laws, that they are not liable for violations of"
