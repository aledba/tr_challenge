  "summary": "On June 6, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans entered a final judgment against a New Orleans Police Department employee who was suspended for making a false and misleading statement in an internal NOPD disciplinary proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Randi Gant violated Rule 705.2 of the National Police Department's (NOPD) policies regarding take-home vehicles.  According to the complaint, Gant, who managed ISB's fleet of vehicles, was not aware of the policies and that her selection of the 0-20 miles option was a mistake.  Gant also alleges that she did not know her husband was on the lease and that this was commensurate with the offense.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, by the nature of her position, Sgt. Gant likely avoided putting 20,000 miles on her personal vehicle as a result of the alleged misstatements.  Finally, the SEC alleges that Gant failed to comply with Rule 6, Paragraph 2 because she made a \"workaround\" to correct the error.  As alleged in the complaint filed in the SEC's Complaint Bulletin, the disciplinary action against Gant was based on a finding by the Commission that she violated Rule 6.2.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's order, the officer consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $72.12 per hour, $2,000 in disgorgement, and a $72,500 civil penalty.  On June 7, 2020, the Commission issued its final judgment, enjoining Gant from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to repay the $72 million penalty with prejudgment interest in the amount of $3,500.  It also ordered Gant to pay $2.2 million in restitution, $1,500 in interest, and $500 in civil penalties.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Precious Banks of the Public Integrity Bureau, and the litigation will be led by Graham Loomis and Ms. Banks. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana, the Alabama Department of Banking and Securities and the Louisiana Secretary of State's Office."
