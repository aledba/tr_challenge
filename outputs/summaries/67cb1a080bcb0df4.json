  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in favor of the agency that administers the agency's custody and visitation programs.  The court's order, which was entered on December 27, 2018, permanently enjoins the agency from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the agency to pay a portion of child welfare agency's parent's medical bills.  In a parallel action, on January 23, 2019, the court entered a final judgment against the agency, agreeing that it would not grant the agency the right to return any child or parent to custody.  According to the court's final judgment, the agency was entitled to a temporary restraining order and to a permanent injunction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions, and ordering him to pay $1,000 in disgorgement, $100 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On January 24, 2020, the Court issued an order granting the agency an emergency court order to expedite the issuance of the court order.  As set forth in the order, this order requires the court to consider the merits of the case before it can issue an order imposing an injunction or other emergency order, and requires the defendant to show cause of action in the case.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018.  Separately, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Pennsylvania announced criminal charges against the defendant.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael E. Blystone and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Children and Family Services, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, and the Pennsylvania Office of Child and Family Education."
