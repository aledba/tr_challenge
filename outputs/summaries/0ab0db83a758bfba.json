  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against George R. Ruibal, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to forty years in prison for the beating and strangulation death of a woman with whom he was living at the time.  According to the court's order, Ruibal consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  The court also granted the defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations, and ordered Ruibal to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Ruibal.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Ruibal with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court agreed to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a penalty equal to the amount of money Ruibal has already been ordered to pay, as well as a $50,000 officer- and director bar. The court granted Ruibal's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered him to surrender his passport, and barred him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Ruibal agreed to settle the case against him by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, ordering him to disgorge $5,000, and imposing a $25,000 penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Crider and supervised by Jennifer Chun Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Chun Barry and Ms. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Colorado Department of Health and Human Services."
