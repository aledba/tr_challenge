  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a summary judgment in favor of the Shah defendants, who are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison, Ala., alleges that, in 2007, Ashish Shah, the owner of eight Subway restaurants in and around Madison County, prepared to open a ninth Subway restaurant in Huntsville, Alabama. According to the complaint, Shah and his father, Ramesh Shah, formed the corporation for the purposes of owning and operating the restaurant. Patel allegedly purchased a 25 percent ownership interest in the corporation in 2008. Patel alleges that the company failed to pay him his fair share of the profits, failed to convey to him an ownership interest equal to that for which he paid, and failed to convert profits, revenues, bonuses, assets, and property of the corporation. Patel also alleges that Shah had withheld Patel's share of franchise-sales commissions that the corporation received from its franchisor, Doctor's Associates, Inc.  Patel's claims were barred by the applicable statutes of limitations and he had no reason to conduct an inquiry that would have led him to those claims.  In addition, Patel's complaint alleges that he failed to show sufficient evidence to show that he was entitled to a judgment as final pursuant to Rule 54(b), that he had fully performed his obligation to the defendant, and to obtain the performance or completion of the defendant's performance or the completion of his performance in a consolidated action.  On August 20, 2018, the court granted the SEC's motion for summary judgment against Patel, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000. Patel agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge $140,000 in ill-gotten gains plus interest, and requires him to submit a civil injunctive action. Patel has also agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations. Patel will also be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, offer and sale of any securities. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Department of Securities and Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Securities Commission in this matter."
