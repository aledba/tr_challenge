  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the trustee from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Lloyd to withdraw from representing the debtors in the adversary proceedings.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, Lloyd represented a chapter 7 debtor in possession for a few days before it consented to appointment of a chapter 11 trustee. The complaint alleges that Lloyd represented the debtor for a short time before it filed for bankruptcy and after he was retained by Mack Industries, Ltd. (\"Mack\"). The complaint further alleges that, as a result of his representation of the debtor, Lloyd was unable to represent the debtor in an adversary proceeding because he had no direct duty to the trustee or the estate.  The complaint also alleges that as a trustee, he owes a duty to his clients - a duty of loyalty to the estate - to assist them in performing their statutory duties under the bankruptcy code.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Lloyd. The SEC's action against Lloyd is pending final approval by the court.  On May 3, 2019, the court granted the trustee's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Lloyd to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the trustee has agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering Lloyd to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  To learn more about bankruptcy law violations, see Litigation Release No. 523-24, July 17, 2018."
