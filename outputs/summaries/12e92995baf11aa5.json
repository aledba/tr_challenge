  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Indiana announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against the city of Charlestown, Indiana, charging the city with failing to comply with the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that, in 2016, the city and Indiana-American Water Company, Inc., an Indiana corporation that provides water and wastewater services to approximately 300,000 customers across Indiana, failed to timely and accurately record the purchase price and related costs of a municipal water utility property.  According to the complaint, the IURC's finding that the city failed to adequately record the transaction was in the public interest, caused some utility customers to see \"brown water\" in their taps, and required the city to pay rates that would be reasonable to the other party's existing customers.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and permanent injunctions.  In a parallel action, the Indiana Department of Commerce today announced that it has issued an order suspending the sale of certain municipal water utilities in the Commonwealth of Indiana and ordering the SEC to conduct an independent investigation into the matter.  On March 28, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint against the City of Chicago, alleging that it violated Section 8-1.5-2-5 of the Exchange Act and Rules 8-3-1, 8-4-2, and 9-11-1 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the City violated Section 5 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, which requires the Commission to determine whether a certain amount of remediation or other reasonable remediation should be required in connection with a municipal sale or disposition of a utility property, and that the Commission has failed to consider whether a reasonable part of the remediation and other reasonable measures should be included in the proposed sale price.   The complaint charges the City with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of this, and seeks a permanent injunction, an order requiring the City to pay a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Finally, the complaint seeks an order appointing a receiver to oversee the sale and disposition of any municipal utility property that is subject to the commission's approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by"
