  "summary": "On January 1, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against a former health care worker who was barred from renewing his license.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Chicago, Batu Shakari, then known as David Beverly, was convicted of attempted murder in 1975.  The complaint alleges that the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (DFIN) improperly extended the revocation of Mr. Shakari's license to health care workers who, among other things, had been convicted of a forcible felony.  As alleged in the complaint, the Department of Health Care Services (DHS) had no discretion to revoke his license after it was notified of his prior felony conviction.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that, in 2014, the DHS revoked his license because he was not a registered nurse at the time of his conviction, and that, by renewing the license after that date, the department was unable to determine whether he was eligible to apply for a new license under the DFIN law.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Shakari consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
