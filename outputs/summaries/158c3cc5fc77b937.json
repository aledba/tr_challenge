  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Kentucky yesterday entered a final judgment against a convicted drug dealer and his co-defendant in a parallel criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Lexington, Kentucky, alleges that the defendant, Luis Morales-Montanez and Jessica Acosta, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that, in a three-day trial, the defendant and Acosta consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The court also granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendant\u2019s assets, and ordering the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $1,500. Acosta agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The SEC alleges that Morales- Montanez, Acosta and the defendants violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b2-1 thereunder, and that Acosta violated Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933. The Court also ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties of $2,500 each. The defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-registered broker-dealer. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Morales.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on October 17, 2017, the SEC obtained a court order freezing the defendants' assets, freezing their cash, and imposing a $1 million civil penalty.

Barry and Mr. Gibson and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney for New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kentucky Department of Criminal Justice."
