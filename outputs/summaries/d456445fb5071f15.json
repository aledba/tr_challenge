  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that John Tyler Routten, a father of two children, was unlawfully deprived of the right to custody and visitation with his children in violation of Rule 59 and 60 of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, after the trial court entered the final judgment on 3 October 2014, the court granted Plaintiff the sole authority to \"permit\" her to submit to a neuropsychological evaluation by a non-physician, without admitting or denying her claim for attorney's fees.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Routten.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed on March 24, 2017, the defendant violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by failing to comply with the court's order to grant her a temporary restraining order and an attorney's fee exemption.  Without admitting to these violations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On March 26, 2018, the SEC filed an amended complaint against Defendant, charging her with violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15a-1 and Rule 15b2-2 thereunder, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000 and a $500,000 civil penalty, and to pay an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar, among other things.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (2014).  The case was supervised by Kelly G. Ostrove, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
