  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Joshua D. Sant, Jr. on two counts of second degree murder and conspiracy to commit second-degree murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on April 22, 2016, Sant confessed to the murders of Demond and Chelsey Copling, and that Austin Dyess, his co-defendant, used two separate guns to commit the murders.  According to the complaint, Austin allegedly told the officers that he was going to kill the couple because he \"testified at trial that he did not shoot either of the two victims.\"  The complaint further alleges that Austin allegedly used a 12-gauge shotgun in the truck and shot the couple in the head.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Sant agreed to the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000.  Sant also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Sant, charging him with one count of first degree murder in violation of the federal securities laws, and with aiding and abetting Sant's violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  On August 7, 2018, the court granted Sant's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered him to return to his home, and ordered Austin to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting to the allegations, Sant consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from further violations of Sections 13(a), 13(c) and 13(d)(2) of Securities Act Section 14:30, 13d-1, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, including, without limitation, the issuance of a civil injunctive relief, a penny stock bar, and an officer-and-director bar.  To settle the case, Sant has agreed to a permanent injunction, to be permanently barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and to a five-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from associating with any broker, dealer, or investment adviser in any SEC case.  Additionally, Sant will pay a $150,000 civil penalty. "
