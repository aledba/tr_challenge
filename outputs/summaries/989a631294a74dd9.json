  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Orchard Hiltz & McCliment, Inc. (\"OHM\") in a civil action brought by the Estate of Michael Koch.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that OHM violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, OHM was not required to indemnify OHM for any amount greater than the contractor's degree of fault.  OHM also alleges that Shmina and Platinum violated the indemnity provisions of MCL 691.991, also known as the indemnification-invalidating act (the act).  The complaint further alleges that the SEC improperly failed to resolve its cross-claims by failing to resolve the issues raised by the defendants.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against OHM.  On March 4, 2013, the U. S. District Judge in Manhattan granted summary disposition in favor of OHM on the basis of a finding that the defendants violated the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael Koch and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Frank W. Lynch and Ms. Lynch. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
