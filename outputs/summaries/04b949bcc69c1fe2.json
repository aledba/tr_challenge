The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bergenfield, N.J., alleges that, in a custodial interrogation conducted in the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office, defendant asked his step-granddaughter, A.I., to try on her bathing suit to see if it fit. The complaint alleges that defendant read the waiver portion of the form while a Spanish-speaking officer read it to him, and that defendant replied, \"s\u00ed\" after each right, \"yes.\"  The complaint further alleges that the officer failed to meet its burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant understood his Miranda rights and that he had the right to counsel before doing so if he wished.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The judgment also prohibits the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter or other emergency relief.  In a parallel action, the U.N.
