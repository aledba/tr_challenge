  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in favor of a motion to expedite the release of documents requested by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan, non-advocacy, independent journalism organization.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that, in violation of the federal securities laws, the Department has failed to provide timely and reasonable assistance in processing the requested documents.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against two individuals for their roles in the alleged misconduct.  According to the SEC's Complaint, Mark H. Herrington, Chairman, House Comm. on Intelligence, and Eliot E. \"Eliot\" Engle, Chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, both of whom are charged by the SEC with aiding and abetting the violations of Section 5(b)(5) and 5(c).  The complaint also alleges that Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, acting as an unregistered broker of information between the DOD and the OMB, failed to adequately represent the importance of this information to the American public.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Schneiderman consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a)(6)(E)(i)(1) and (3)(B) of Securities Act and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,078, which will be determined by the court at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On November 22, 2019, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws. The court granted the request for a preliminary injunction on December 12, 2019 and ordered the processing of at least 106 pages of responsive documents by December 20, 2019. The order also ordered the filing of a civil injunctive action against the Defendants, which is pending final approval by the Court. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Attorney General's Office, the U.K. Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
