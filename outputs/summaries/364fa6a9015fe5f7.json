  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Social Security Administration (SSA) for failing to properly assess a patient\u2019s PTSD and IBS condition when deciding whether she was disabled.  The SEC previously issued a temporary restraining order against the SSA, which issued an order requiring it to determine whether a person with severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) should be entitled to Social Security benefits.  In its order, the SEC also ordered SSA to consider whether Stewart was entitled to benefits based on substantial evidence, including the results of a stress test, a successful hernia repair, a cardiac study, and earache treatments.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order, Stewart consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins SSA from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The order also prohibits SSA employees from making false or misleading statements to the Commission in connection with SSA decisions, including that the Commission improperly assessed Stewart's PTSD, which caused her to be unable to perform simple, routine work, including production rate pace jobs; and that she regularly denied having diarrhea or other IBS-related symptoms. The SEC also requires SSA staff to review the medical records of people who have suffered from PTSD or IBS, including those who have been diagnosed with IBS. The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the United States District Court in New York entered a judgment against SSA against the Commissioner of Social Security, finding that the Commissioner violated the Administrative Procedure Act of 1940. The Commission has agreed to a preliminary injunction, to which SSA will consent, and to a permanent officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-2(a).  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of Inspector General in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis."
