  "summary": "On December 19, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Gregory James, Jr., a New York resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, James alleges that he was introduced to Jack Rieley and Jaye Muller, who asked him to develop software solutions for the exclusive use of JFAX Communications, Inc.  The complaint alleges that James agreed to develop original software solutions, write original software routines, carry out testing and otherwise provide technological solutions, and be responsible for the creation, execution and delivery of those solutions.  As alleged in the complaint, James failed to allege that he had any ownership or financial interest in any patentable methods or systems invented in creating such products.  In a parallel action, on December 22, 2016, the United States District Court in Manhattan entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Mr. James from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078, which is equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Gregory J. James. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
