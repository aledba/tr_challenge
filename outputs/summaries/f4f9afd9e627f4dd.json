  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former meter reader who was denied Social Security benefits based on inconsistent testimony.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on May 15, 2014, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that Tina M. Brewer, M.D., a registered representative, had the following severe impairments: Cervical degenerative disc disease and fibromyalgia.  According to the complaint, Brewer had difficulty using her hands and moving her neck, and could not stand or stand for more than two hours each day.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Plaintiff had difficulty with her walking, standing, and using her right lower extremity, such as for the operation of foot pedals.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Brewer consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.
