  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a North Carolina-based waste management company for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal, state, and local laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that, in April 2014, TRK Development, LLC (\"TRK\") sought to construct a structural addition to a warehouse located on the site of an existing municipal landfill. The complaint alleges that TRK hired surveyors, an architect, and a civil engineer to prepare an erosion and sedimentation control plan for the site. According to the complaint, the plans were prepared with the knowledge and consent of the Land Quality Section of the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and the Division of Waste Management (DWM). The complaint further alleges that the materials indicated the presence of trash beneath the surface of the soil TRK intended to excavate, and that the soil boring markers on the plans indicated that trash was leaving the site looking like a landfill.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for North Carolina announced criminal charges against TRK. The SEC filed a civil injunctive action, which is subject to court approval, charging TRK with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting TRK's violations of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal and state laws, and order TRK to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $14,287, which would be equal to the civil penalty imposed by the court. The settlement is pending final approval by the SEC.  On August 2, 2017, the Honorable Julia Lynn Gullett of the SEC issued an order enjoining TRK from violating Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(c) of The Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20 thereunder; ordering TRK not to violate the Exchange Act; ordering it to comply with Rule 13a-20; and ordering it not to exceed $1,000,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Ms. Gullett. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Mr."
