  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against SSA alleging that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the court improperly ordered SSA to provide reunification services for parents and children who died while under the influence of drugs.  According to the complaint, the court found that parents' neglect was a significant factor in Junior's death, and that they failed to provide adequate support for the children.  In addition, the complaint alleges that SSA failed to adequately consider the impact of Mother's neglect on Junior, who died on March 9, 2015, while sleeping in the same bed with his father, D.M., his mother, and his brother, Z.G., who died the same day.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, SSA consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins SSA from violating the federal securities laws, imposes a temporary restraining order, imposes an order appointing a receiver, and imposes a conduct-based injunction.  SSA also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement and prejudgment interest that it will pay in the future.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
