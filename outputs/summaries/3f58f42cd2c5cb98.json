  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Calamos Advisors LLC, a registered investment adviser based in Naperville, Illinois, for breaching its fiduciary duty under Section 36(b) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on November 19, 2018 and unsealed on October 3, 2018, CalamOS agreed to settle charges that it improperly overstated its investment advisory fees by more than $1.5 billion in 2016.  The SEC alleges that, contrary to the representations made in the SEC filings, the fund's advisory fees were disproportionately high, and the fees charged to the fund were substantially higher than those paid by other fund advisory firms.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced parallel criminal charges against the fund.  On October 4, 2019, the Honorable Paul G. Gartenberg of the U.N. Division of Economic and Risk Analysis (DORA) granted a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and appointed a receiver of the funds to oversee the funds' operations. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Office of the Secretary of the Department of Justice (DOJ) in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone offering investment advice by using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
