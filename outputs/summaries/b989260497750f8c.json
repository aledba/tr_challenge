  "summary": "On September 25, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered final judgments against two individuals who were found liable for violations of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, New York, on January 24, 2009, the New York State Department of Economic Development (DED) issued a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also issued a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the defendants' assets.  In its order, the court found that DED violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by failing to determine whether a business enterprise was a \"shirt-changer\" when it was certified pursuant to the 1:1 benefit-cost test.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, DED and DED consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin DED from violating these provisions.  DED also ordered DED to consider whether certain of the defendants were shirt-changers, including Lyell Mt. Read, Lyell St. Read and Gateway, which, at the time of the administrative appeal, were not certified as empire zone enterprises by the DED, despite repeated requests by the Board to do so.  Finally, the Court found that Lyell and St. Kitts failed to demonstrate sufficient evidence to justify the Board's determination to revoke DED's certifications.  As a result of the court's order, all defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Sections 9(a)(1) and 9(b)(5) and 10(c) and 13(a) of The Exchange Act, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Additionally, the defendants agreed not to participate in the issuance, purchase, offer, offer or sell of any real estate in the Empire Zone, and pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000, $50,000 or $75,000 per year, respectively.  On the same day DED issued its final judgment, it issued an order permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Kurcsics and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Buffalo Regional Office. The litigation will be led by James S. Cotter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Commerce, and the Federal Office of Inspector"
