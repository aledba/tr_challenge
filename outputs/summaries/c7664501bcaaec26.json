  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against Raul Alexander, a resident of Cura\u00e7ao, ordering him to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that Alexander violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Alexander agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  Alexander also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Alexander.  On May 22, 2018, the court granted Alexander's request for a preliminary injunction and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  As alleged, Alexander entered a conditional guilty plea on July 23, 2015, when he was arrested in Curacao. The court found that Alexander was not entitled to a lighter sentence because he did not know or intend that the drug was going to be imported into the country, and that he had a long-standing business relationship with Rosario-Jimenez, who was also arrested for the same drug.  Without admitting or denied the SEC's allegations, Alexander consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $1,500.   The court also granted Alexander a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from associating with anyone with a history of drug-related criminal conduct, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, sale, or promotion of any drug, including in the manufacture, distribution, or sale of any product. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Market Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Boston Office of Inspector General, and the Massachusetts Department of Criminal Justice."
