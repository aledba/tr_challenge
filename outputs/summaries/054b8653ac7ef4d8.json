  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment in favor of Stilson, who is seeking to have her guardianship and conservatorship terminated.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that, in August 2015, a district court appointed a conservator and conservator over Jacobson. The court found that, as a matter of law, a person with a severe brain injury is entitled to compensation for services performed in the capacity of a guardian or conservator, and that, at the time of her resignation from the conservator's role, Stillson was not acting in her capacity as a responsible person and had no cognitive problems that would prevent her from safeguarding his assets. The SEC also found that Stilsson failed to adequately and in good faith represent to the court that Jacobson was fully capable of managing his own affairs. In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against her.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the Utah Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order halting the proceedings of the emergency court. The emergency court temporarily halted the proceedings. The case was investigated by the Salt Lake Regional Office and the Utah Office of Inspector General, and the case was supervised by Scott A. Thompson. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, as well as the Utah Secretary of State's Office.
