  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Utah today announced criminal charges against a former Clean Harbors Environmental Services employee for his role in a workplace accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that David Fox was injured while cleaning a large tank using a high-pressure hose.  According to the complaint, Fox injured his right hand when he turned on the hose while he was cleaning the tank.  Fox was immediately taken to the hospital where a doctor performed surgery on him.   The complaint alleges that, based on his injury, Fox suffered Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) and that he was entitled to permanent total disability compensation based on the findings of the panel that compiled the 2006 Utah Guides.  As alleged, Fox sought a second opinion from another doctor, who also diagnosed CRPS, and opined that Fox was an extremely straightforward and classic example of CRPS.  In making her diagnosis, the Commission agreed with the complaint that the Rule did not require that any medical evaluation of whether Fox has CRPS be governed by the 2000 AMA Guides, which, as noted, list eleven symptoms that are known to be associated with a permanent impairment rating.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Fox consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The final judgment also prohibits Fox from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of securities, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against him. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John R. Bade-Brown and Eric R. Werner of the Salt Lake Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Ms. Werner and Ms. Braunstein. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Department of Workforce Services, the Utah Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Department of Health and Human Services Criminal Investigations Division, as well as the Utah Secretary of State's Office."
