  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment against defendants who waived attorney-client privilege in connection with an alleged sexual harassment complaint.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boca Raton, Florida, charges defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In its order, the court also entered a temporary restraining order against defendants from violating the anti-harassment provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Section\u00c2\u00a010(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 5b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000 and a $500,000 civil penalty, and bars them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 30, 2014, a federal district court in Iowa issued an order requiring defendants to comply with the court's order by consenting to entry of an order imposing an injunction, barring defendants from raising or denying their claims of violations of the federal securities laws, and requiring them to provide evidence to support their affirmative defense. The order also requires defendants to provide a copy of the SEC\u2019s order, which was issued on May 31, 2014. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Iowa Department of Justice in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed an enforcement action on May 24, 2016, against a company accused of engaging in a conduct-based discrimination scheme.  According to the SEC, the investigation was conducted by Jeff Tolsma and Jeremie Kneip and was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and the Office of Inspector General."
