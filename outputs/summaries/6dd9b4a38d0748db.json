  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against a former employee of a financial services company who filed an emergency action to vacate an arbitration award.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Hoai Ngo, who was then employed as Co-Head of the taxable high-yield research group at Oppenheimer & Co., Inc., misappropriated and misused a $1.2 million award to support his personal use of the company's funds.  According to the complaint, on June 14, the date of Mr. Ngo's demotion, he received a lower discretionary bonus than he had received in previous years.  In addition, on August 11, 2014, the same day he was demoted, he sent an email to a co-worker informing her that he would be taking FMLA leave in a few weeks.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, this email was intended to show that the co-head knew of a governing legal principle yet refused to apply it or ignored it altogether, and that he was an eligible employee under the FMLA.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the arbitrator simply disregarded the law in rendering the award to him.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's Order of Conduct, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins the Commission from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the Commission to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of any lost production or lost pay.  On May 20, 2019, the Honorable Michael H. Dolinger of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia entered a judgment against the Commission against the former employee, permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to return to work as a research analyst, and imposing a $500,000 civil penalty.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by David M. Welshhans and supervised by Eric R. Werner and Glenn S. Gordon of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Mr. Wyshhans, Ms. Gordon, and Mr. Werner under the supervision of Jan Folena.\u00c2\u00a0 The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Compliance in this matter."
