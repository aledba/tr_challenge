  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against the father and mother of three children who were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 15, 2017, Ladarious Benson, the father's attorney, and Melinda Barton, the mother's legal guardian, consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently terminated their parental rights to the children.  The complaint alleges that the father had been incarcerated for obstruction of justice when the children were taken into emergency custody and that, since then, he had not been able to properly care for the children, despite repeated requests from the mother and the father to participate in child-support services, mental-health services, drug screening, and substance-abuse treatment.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that, after the father was incarcerated for failing to show up to court hearings and visitations on the same days, he and the mother began living together and engaged to be married.  On January 31, 2018, the court issued a final judgment permanently enjoining the father from violating Section 12-15-10 of the Exchange Act, and ordering him to pay $100,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a $10,000 civil penalty.  Barton consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount owed to her by the court in the alternative.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Barton. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Department of Children and Family Services, the Department of Health and Human Services, Criminal Justice Division, the Internal Revenue Service, the State Department of Justice, the Criminal Division's Office of Inspector General, the Office of the Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, the Division of Enforcement's Criminal Justice Fraud Task Force and the Alabama Office of Education and Advocacy.
