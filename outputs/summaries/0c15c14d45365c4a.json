  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 50 years in prison for the attempted second degree murder of Laconna Lashay Smith.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Shreveport, Louisiana, alleges that on September 28, 2015, a Monroe, Louisiana man was arrested and charged with attempted second-degree murder. According to the complaint, the defendant told Smith that he wanted to have sex \"before I kill you\" and \"while I put a bullet in yo head and watch u bleed.\" The complaint alleges that Smith replied that he did not care if she died. The complaint further alleges that after Smith was restrained and airlifted from the hospital, defendant began to beat her and then began to choke her until she stopped resisting. Smith's sister, Anastasia Hester, told the court that she had received a text message from defendant in which he told her that he would \"let Shay [Smith] and bokeem now and we go keep things the'street way' and settle things the \"street way.\" Smith allegedly told her sister that he had no intention of killing her and that he just needed her bag from inside. The SEC alleges that the defendant replied to the woman's text messages by saying that she \"scared for her safety and her mom's\" and that \"you ain't seen nothing yet.\" The SEC also alleges that defendant sent a threatening text message to Smith on the day of the attack, which she replied to, saying that he \"got a kick in the butt\" from her because she was having difficulty breathing. The court found that defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the SEC violated Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties. The final judgments also order Smith to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her life imprisonment. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  A hearing on the criminal charges is scheduled for May 24, 2017.  An examination of the evidence that led to the investigation was conducted by Janie Johnson and Barry"
