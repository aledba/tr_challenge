  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Brooklyn-based rental-stabilization company and its owner in connection with an ongoing housing crisis.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn on July 1, 2014, Georgetown Leasing, LLC (hereinafter Georgetown), is the sole administrator of residential rent regulation and adjudicator of eviction disputes.  The complaint alleges that, in promulgating Rent Stabilization Code \u00a72523.5(b)(1) in 1987, the Department of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) issued an order requiring certain family members residing with named tenants to be entitled to succession rights when a tenant vacates an apartment.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the DHCR did not require the family member to reside in the apartment for more than eight years, and instead required the tenant to reside with the tenant for the one-year period immediately prior to the expiration of a renewal lease.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that Scherley's mother, Marie Jourdain, was the tenant of record when Scherley moved out of the apartment in 2008 and, in September 2009, executed an apartment renewal lease for a term ending December 31, 2011.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the Defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The Defendants have also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 15(a)(2) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder of the Exchange Act, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. McGlynn and Ms. Higgins. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
