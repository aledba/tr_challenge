  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a summary judgment in favor of the Kelker Children, who are seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that on November 7, 1990, Janice Dray executed a Living Trust Agreement, creating the revocable Janice A. Dray Living Trust (Trust) and naming herself as Trustee.  According to the complaint, the trust property was to be converted to cash and distributed in equal shares, share and share alike, to her sister, Alma Franke (Alma), and brother, Ralph Kelker (Ralph).  The complaint alleges that, upon Jacqueline's death, all of the remaining assets in the trust corpus would be distributed to Ralph and Alma, with a \"per stirpes\" division at the second-generation level, instead of creating a life estate for Jacqueline.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the Kelkers Children consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged scheme.  On May 15, 2019, the trial court entered its summary judgment against the Defendants, finding that the defendants violated Sections 17a(a)(1) and 17(b)(2) of Securities Act Section 10(b) and Rule 12b-20 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, pay civil penalties, and pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.   The court also issued an order temporarily suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case that was investigated by the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) and the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Task Force. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jayne Murphy, Stephen Kelker, and Christine Pistula. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Office of the Attorney General in this matter."
