  "summary": "On March 13, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama entered a final judgment against defendant Jamal O'Neal Jackson, Jr., who was sentenced to death for his role in a 2014 capital murder.  The court found that Jackson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Jackson to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Jackson also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  According to the court's order, Jackson was not permitted to participate in the jury selection process because he was under the influence of alcohol.  In a parallel action, the Alabama Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Jackson arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Mobile, Alabama.  On March 16, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Jackson, charging him with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordering him to pay civil penalties of $1,000 and $100,000, respectively.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Jackson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, and imposes a civil penalty of $150,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Office of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
