  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered summary judgment in favor of Appellant Hills and Hollers, LLC, a midstream company, in a related action brought by Scott Stronz.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, on March 27, 2015, Appelant filed a motion for summary judgment on behalf of the company in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Appellee violated the right of way and easement provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2)(A) and (B)(3)(B)(5)(B).  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the company consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of its profits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio today announced criminal charges against the company.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Department of Commerce, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
