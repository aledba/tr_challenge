  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Latisha H. Garrett, a former Visiting Angels employee who was sentenced to 18 months in prison for her role in a scheme to steal $4,800 from an elderly woman.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dayton, Ohio, Garrett was employed as a caregiver for a mentally handicapped woman. The complaint alleges that on or about July 6 or 7, 2017, Garrett and her boyfriend, Eric Kleinholz, lured the victim into believing that he had left his billfold on the dining room table in Tennessee and that he needed money to complete necessary vehicle repairs. Instead, as alleged in the complaint, Garrett took the victim to the bank only on the single occasion of the theft.  The complaint further alleges that the victim \"trusted\" Garrett to deliver the money to the victim's grandson, despite Garrett's apparent lack of genuine remorse for what she had done.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against Garrett, charging her with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  Garrett has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders her to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Garrett has agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, ordering a conduct-based injunction, and imposing a community control sanction or penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and Antonia Shalov Mehraban of the Ohio Division of Criminal Justice.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
