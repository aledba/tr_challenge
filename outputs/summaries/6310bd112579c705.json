  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against a former sheriff\u2019s deputy who was found liable for misconduct related to an alleged domestic violence incident.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against another deputy who also was convicted of misconduct in connection with the same conduct.  On September 27, 2010, Dequan Ballard stole items from a commissary cart. According to the SEC, the deputy, who was assigned to the jail as a correctional supervisor, made false statements during an investigation of the alleged misconduct. The SEC also found that the deputy failed to report two instances of inmate abuse and made multiple false statements in his performance evaluations, including falsely denying knowing that Deputy Lopez had assaulted Ballard during the first incident, denied knowing that the second incident had occurred, and denied recognizing Lopez standing next to him in video footage taken after the second assault. The court found that Montez was liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he was entitled to a 30-day suspension without pay.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Montez.  According to a complaint filed in federal court in Los Angeles, the SEC's findings were unsupported by the evidence presented to the court by the agency, and Montez failed to comply with the Commission's findings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Montez has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his officer-and-director bar, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about officer discipline and disciplinary history, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17.  For additional information on officer discipline, see Civil Service Commission v. San Diego County Civil Service Com. (2017).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Public Safety and the U. S. Attorney\u2019S Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)."
