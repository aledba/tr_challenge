  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the New York City Police Department in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, in 2012 and 2013, the NYPD failed to disclose to law enforcement agencies that it had obtained records related to an ongoing domestic surveillance program involving two individuals and associated organizations.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that the NYPD violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to disclose that the records sought by the complaint were responsive to the requests.  Without admitting or denying the existence of the records, the SEC alleges that it failed to provide a factual basis for the exemption.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the complaint's co-defendant.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, which was unsealed today, that the complaint was filed in violation of Section 5 of the federal securities laws and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Finally, the Complaint charges the NYPD with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b)(5) and 13(a)(2)(A) and (c).  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against the officer and director of a public agency.  For further information, see Matter of Data Tree, LLC v. City of N.Y. Department of Justice, No. 13-cv-01221.  This case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter, as well as the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.N. Secret Service."
