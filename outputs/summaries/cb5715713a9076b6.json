  "summary": "On March 27, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Social Security Administration (SSA) for denying a claimant's application for Social Security benefits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the SSA violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the SEC's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, found that the claimant had moderately severe limitations in the following areas: (1) maintaining an ordinary work routine without special supervision; (2) sustaining an ordinary routine without being distracted; and (3) maintaining socially appropriate behavior.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, however, the complaint alleges that Dr. Burns, Dr. Causeya, and Ms. Ford failed to adequately assess the severity of the claimant's impairment, and failed to provide sufficient evidence to determine whether the claimant was disabled.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Burns and Causeya.  On May 13, 2015, the Commission issued a non-disability determination for Plaintiff, finding that he had moderate limitations in certain areas of his life, including ability to carry out ordinary work activities, including grocery shopping, driving a car, and attending a Christmas party as well as attending a concert.  As alleged in the Complaint, Burns, Causeya and Ford violated Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-1 thereunder, and the Commission violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-11, July 17, 2014.  Separately, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it had issued an order appointing an independent receiver to evaluate the safety and well-being of people with disabilities.  A hearing scheduled for May 26, 2017 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. EST.  To determine whether to proceed with the investigation, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone who has been injured or seriously ill by using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov to identify signs of impairment."
