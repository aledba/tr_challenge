  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against Cooper Plastering Corp. and Paino Roofing Co., Inc. (\"Paino\"), a New Jersey-based roofing company, in a civil action brought by the SEC.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Jersey on November 9, 2017, Ciminelli, a former employee of Cooper, was installing plaster on the roof of Meadowlands Racetrack. The complaint alleges that the roofing contractor had a non-delegable duty to maintain the work site in safe condition, which included the duty to perform safety inspections, correct hazards, and otherwise assure job site conditions were in compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards.  The complaint further alleges that, as a result of the accident, plaintiff suffered significant injuries to his back and shoulder, requiring him to undergo two surgical procedures to repair the damage, and requiring a new trial. The SEC alleges that defendants failed to disclose to the jury that they had suffered serious injuries, that plaintiff had suffered significant detrimental changes in many facets of his life, that he could not engage in leisure, social, or work activities as he had done before the accident and that he had avoided significant future medical expenses.  In addition, the complaint alleges defendants failed not to inform the project safety supervisor of the potential impact of the alleged injury on the project's finances.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $2.4 million, prejudgment interest of $1.2 million, and a civil penalty of $'35,318.19. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 4:49-1(a).
