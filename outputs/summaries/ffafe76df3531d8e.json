  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment against Iowa-based insurance company Travelers Property Casualty Insurance Company of America (Travelers) for negligently failing to cover the roof damage of a bio-solids building.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Iowa City, Iowa, Henderson & Sons, Inc. (Henderson) and its general contractor, Joseph J. Riceland Foods, Inc., (Riceland), hired different engineering firms to determine why certain roof panels were damaged during a windstorm. The complaint alleges that the windstorm and faulty workmanship were not the proximate causes of the damage, and that the roof was not the sole proximate cause of the loss.  The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the Iowa Attorney General's Office (AGO) filed a civil injunctive action against Henderson, charging him with violating the anticoncurrent-cause provision of the insurance policy. The AGO's complaint charges Henderson with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The court will determine the amount of monetary relief to be provided by the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 876 (8th Cir. 2013).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Iowa Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
