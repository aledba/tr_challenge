  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against two real estate brokers, David Schroedl and Associates, for their roles in an alleged breach of fiduciary duty to their clients.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in La Jolla, California, alleges that in September 2013, the Ryans' next door neighbor, Hany Girgis, informed them that he intended to remodel his home, which would permanently obstruct the property's westerly ocean view. The complaint alleges that, according to the complaint, theRyans did not know and therefore did not disclose to the buyers that there was a soil subsidence problem in common areas of the property and that the homeowners' association had filed a lawsuit against the developer. In addition, the complaint alleges, in the course of the litigation, the defendants did not designate an expert witness to establish the existence of any cause of action. The SEC further alleges that the defendants failed to adequately disclose to investors that the planned construction would have a significant impact on the value of the Property.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on May 24, 2018, the court granted summary judgment against the defendants.  In its order granting summary judgment, the Court held that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provision of Section 2079 of the Exchange Act. The court also found that the Defendants violated Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of $96,5000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $95,500, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted an independent review of the securities laws."
