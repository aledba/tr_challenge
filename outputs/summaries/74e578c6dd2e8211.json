  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Tulsa man for his role in a drug-trafficking scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, alleges that, on August 6, 2016, a federal district court in Tulsa, Oklahoma, entered a final judgment against Pablo Padilla without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The court found that Padilla had access to the August 6 police report, which had not been entered into evidence, and that, contrary to the court\u2019s finding, Padilla was in possession of 17.38 grams of methamphetamine and a.25 caliber pistol. Padilla also allegedly possessed a.38-caliber pistol, which the court found to be consistent with its finding. The complaint further alleges that the court improperly relied on an August 2016 police report that was not admitted into evidence. In its judgment, the court held that the defendant had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the due-process provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(1) thereunder of the federal securities laws. The Court also found that the defendants violated the mandatory minimum sentencing provision of Section 5(b)(2) and (3) and ordered Padilla to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New Jersey today announced related criminal charges. The SEC also announced related civil injunctions against future violations of Section 15(e) and 15e-a-1 of the Exchange Act and Rule 16a-3 thereunder. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, Eric R. Birkenheier, and Glenn S. Gordon of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson."
