  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Janice Jeffers, the widow of Jermon Jeffers who was fatally injured in a tractor-trailer accident in April 2015.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Janice had vision problems during childhood, but was diagnosed with RP when she was 15 years old, approximately two years before Decedent's death.  The complaint alleges that Janice's RP affected her peripheral vision, which is more than an inability to see at night but also issues with light and dark adaptation, add additional problems with performing activities of daily living.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that, since Janice was a senior at a public high school, she was able to get around and do certain school activities by herself, such as writing on whiteboards and overhead projectors at school if the lights were on.  Janice also had difficulty adjusting from light to dark and dark to light, which affected her vision.  As a result of her condition, her ability to see things around her has deteriorated significantly since her husband's death, and she is unable to drive or do any other school activities without assistance from her father.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Janice from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Janice to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Edward H. Bedrossian, Jr., M.D., F.A.C.S., and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Bissland, Ms. D'Avino, and Mr. Gaunt, and the case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
