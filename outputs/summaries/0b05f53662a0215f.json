  "summary": "On January 22, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against two South Carolina citizens for failing to comply with the requirements of the Hague Convention on the provision of civil procedure.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  According to the SEC's order, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United Kingdom's Attorney General announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On January 24, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Hynie and Brown, seeking a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against them from serving as officers or directors of a public company.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael O'Meara and Cliff White, and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. White and Ms. Welshhans, and the case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the British Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the British Columbia Securities Commission, the Canadian Securities Inspection Agency, the Australian Securities and Exchange Commission and the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York."
