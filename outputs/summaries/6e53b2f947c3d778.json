  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 27, 2018 entered a final judgment against Mark Roth, a California resident, in a probate case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that Mark Roth violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Mark was not entitled to a hearing or an opportunity to present his claims of equity because he was not a party to the 1991 Decree.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in his capacity as executor of McKie Sr.\u2019s estate, Mark had a contingent remainder interest in the trust that was not vested with him.  Mark also had a property interest in a trust created by his grandfather, McKie W. Roth, Jr., Diane Roth Lauer, Joanne Roth Gibbons and James Barron.  As set forth in the SEC's Complaint, Mark failed to give notice to the probate court that he was entitled to receive a copy of the 1991 Judgment, which included a provision requiring the trustee to recognize Mark as a beneficiary of the trust upon his death.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Mark consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $2,250,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Additionally, the judgment orders Mark to pay disgorgement of $1,500,000 plus prejudgment interest of $100,000 and a $50,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 596, 542, 541, and 582 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Mark.  A hearing scheduled for October 17, 2018, is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. Eastern.
