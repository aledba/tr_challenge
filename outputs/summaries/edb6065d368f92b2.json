  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of a sperm donor who was unable to establish paternity based upon his non-existent relationship with a woman.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, Jason P. filed a petition in 2012 to establish a parental relationship with Gus S., a child born to Danielle S. in December 2009.  The complaint alleges that Jason provided the sperm to a licensed physician and surgeon for use in artificial insemination of a woman's child.  As alleged in the complaint, however, Jason could not establish paternity under section 7613(b) because he was not married to the woman who became pregnant with the child, nor could he establish paternity with the sperm provided to him.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jason for his role in the alleged scheme.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Jason agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his legal fees.  Finally, the court granted Jason's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from participating in the sale, purchase, offer, or sale of any semen, other than for the purpose of establishing paternity under the federal securities laws, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company or association with an unregistered broker-dealer.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Los Angeles Regional Office by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Health and Human Services."
