  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Colorado today entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of Michael Dean Casper, who died on July 15, 2014, the date the jury returned its verdict on his breach of contract claim.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Denver, Casper brought a civil injunctive action against Guarantee Trust Life Insurance Company (GTRIC) alleging breach of contracts, bad-faith breach of insurance contract, and unreasonable delay or denial of insurance benefits. The SEC alleges that the jury found that Casper was entitled to a judgment based upon his conduct, but that the final judgment did not apply to Casper's conduct.  The SEC further alleges that, based on the jury's finding, Casasper was not entitled to an award of punitive damages and instead was entitled only to a partial award of non-duplicative damages.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Casper.

As a result of the court's order, GTL has agreed to settle the case against it by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-20-101(1).  The Court of Appeals previously issued a judgment against GTRIC in July 2014, finding that it had improperly entered final judgments against certain defendants based on conduct unrelated to the conduct of the other defendants in the same case. The Court also issued a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 13(a), 13(c) and 13(b)(5)(A) and (c) thereunder. The final judgment also prohibits the payment of any punitive or non-economic damages in a civil action, including in the event of a default judgment.  GTL also agreed to a settlement that requires disgorg"
