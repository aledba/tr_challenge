  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Richard Holbrook, Jr., a convicted felon, for his role in the November 27, 2006, murder of Michael Auger.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on the morning of Thanksgiving, the defendant was found dead in his home, lying face down in a pool of blood.  According to the complaint, Meagher was known to carry large sums of cash on his person, that he had a \"friendly\" relationship with the victim, and that he was trying to extort money from the victim.  Meagher allegedly told the court that he did not have any money prior to the victim's murder, that the victim had been \"going crazy thinking of [Meagher]\" and that \"nothing of evidentiary value\" was found on the hard drive.\"  The complaint also alleges that the defendant failed to disclose to the jury that he and the victim were in an intimate relationship, that Meagher had left the victim and wanted Meagher to return to repair the relationship.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Meagher.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Holbrook consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.95 plus prejudgment interest of $2,077.95, a civil penalty of $100,000, and a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged scheme to commit the crime.  On the same day, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against the defendant and ordered him to appear before the court for a hearing on the issues raised in the complaint.  A hearing for a new trial is scheduled for May 10, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018.   The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the New York Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
