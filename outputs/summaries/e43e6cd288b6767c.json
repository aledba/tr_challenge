  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against defendant Carlos Nicholson, who was convicted of second-degree felony murder on January 7, 2016.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that Nicholson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC alleges that, in a parallel criminal case, Nicholson was convicted on the same charges.  According to the complaint, Nicholson told the court that he was in possession of a pound of marijuana and intended to sell it to a man who tried to rob him at gunpoint during a drug deal. The complaint alleges that he did not have the right of self-defense, but rather used reasonable force to defend himself against violent assailants with a gun.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, Nicholson's confession and the evidence corroborating it were inconsistent with the facts of the case.  In addition, Nicholson has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in Baltimore entered a temporary restraining order against Nicholson, ordering him to surrender his passport and pay a civil penalty of $500,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Nicholson consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The court also ordered Nicholson to pay disgorgement of $3,500, prejudgment interest of $100,000, and to pay civil penalties of $600,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, to be determined by the court at a later date.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2018 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (2014).  In a related matter, the Court of Appeals today issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the background of anyone selling or offering to sell a controlled substance, including whether they are registered professionals, to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support a conviction for a felony felony murder. The court's order requires that the SEC determine whether a defendant is entitled to a jury trial based on the facts"
