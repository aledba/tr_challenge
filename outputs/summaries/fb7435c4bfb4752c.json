  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of Sacramento and Sacramento Basketball Holdings, LLC in an emergency action to halt construction of a downtown arena project.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, California, alleges that the City violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to adequately consider the impact of a proposed downtown arena construction project on the downtown area.  According to the complaint, the City failed to adequately analyze the potential impact of the project on downtown Sacramento residents and businesses.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in failing to consider the potential impacts of the downtown arena, the city did not properly consider whether the project would be environmentally superior.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the California Secretary of State's Office today issued an order requiring the City to submit a final environmental impact statement (CEQA) by the end of the month, which included a recommendation that the city not proceed with the project until it had completed its environmental review.  Additionally, the order requires the city to provide a copy of the CEQA report to the court, which is subject to court approval.  Finally, the court granted the City's request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, which prohibits the City from imposing any pre-judgment judgment against a public agency, and from issuing an order suspending or freezing the assets of any public agency for a period of at least five years.  On May 20, 2014, a federal district court in San Diego entered a temporary restraining order against Saltonstall and ordered her to comply with the court's order.  After the court issued its order, the SEC filed a complaint against the city, charging it with violating Section 15(b)(2)(A) and Rule 15b-5 thereunder, and seeking a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 16(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 16b2-3 thereunder. The complaint also charged the city with violating Rule 16a-1, which requires a court to determine whether an agency is entitled to an exemption from certain federal laws, including the right to refuse entry of a judgment imposing an injunction, imposing a $75,000 civil penalty, and prohibiting the city from issuing or selling any security or other security-related security measures. The SEC is seeking a court order halting the construction of the new arena and ordering the city"
