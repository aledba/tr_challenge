The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, alleges that, from at least 2013 through at least 2018, Pawlow and his campaign staff engaged in a scheme to solicit campaign contributions from a New York-based real estate developer in exchange for a contract to collect delinquent real estate taxes for the city.  According to the complaint, the scheme was orchestrated by Pawlowski and Ruchlewicz, who both agreed to participate in the scheme.
