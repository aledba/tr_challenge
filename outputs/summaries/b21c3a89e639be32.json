  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against General Cable, Inc., a Kentucky-based wire and cable manufacturer, and its former CEO, Gregory B. Kenny, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, on February 23, 2012, and unsealed on February 10, 2016, the defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the effectiveness of GC's internal controls over financial reporting.  The SEC alleges that, contrary to these statements, GC failed to implement and maintain sufficient internal controls to detect and prevent violations of the FCPA.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to inform GC's overseas auditors that it had deficiencies in its internal controls and that it was at risk of sanctions or termination of the contract.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, GC consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, and orders the company to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.5 million.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Financial Regulation today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On February 13, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against GC, Kenny, and Robinson, charging them with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Rule\u00c2\u00a010b2 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting GC's violations of Section 5(b).  The complaint also charges the defendants with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act for their roles in the alleged violations of Rule 5a-5, and seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties against each of them.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 527, 564, and 17a-1, 2013.  SEC Complaint No. 6, 566, 567, 571, 565, 541, 582, 532, and 584 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The Complaint also seeks a permanent injunction against future violations and a conduct-based injunction against further violations.  Among other things, the court has ordered GC to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. "
