  "summary": "On May 27, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against Sameis Holdings, LLC, doing business as San Francisco AutoReturn, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 170(6) of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, Sameis filed a complaint in 2009 alleging that the City of San Diego had improperly terminated its contract with a computer-based system for managing the towing of vehicles.  The complaint alleges that Sameis, as a party to the action, had the burden of proving that it and DTS had substantially adverse interests in the action and therefore could not make a subsequent peremptory challenge.  In addition, as alleged in the complaint, the complaint alleges Sameis had no interest in DTS's affirmative legal claims for conduct occurring before August 4, 2010, when Sameis acquired the assets from DTS.  As alleged, in addition to the fact that DTS previously filed a section 170.6 perempory challenge and there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that the interests of DTS and Sameis are substantially adverse, the one challenge per side rule applies to all of the parties involved in this action.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Sameis from participating in any future actions or proceedings related to this matter, and orders Sameis to pay $450,000 in attorney fees and city and auto return attorney fees.  On May 28, 2013, the trial court granted Sameis's motion for summary judgment against DTS, ordering it to disgorge its allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and appointing a new judge to determine the amount of disgorgement and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion by the parties in the case.   The court also issued an emergency court order temporarily suspending Sameis' pending motion to amend the judgment, ordering that the court issue an order appointing a temporary restraining order to halt the pending litigation. \u00c2\u00a0The court's order temporarily halted the pending action against the city, DTS &ldld.gov website, and the DTS&rd.gov investor relations website.
