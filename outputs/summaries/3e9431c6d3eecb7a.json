  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Minnesota today entered final judgments against the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis and its affiliated non-profit entities in an emergency action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Paul, Minnesota, alleges that the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Roman Catholic Church, and several of its affiliated entities violated the antifraud provisions of Section 303(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that, in 2010 and 2016, the church and the archdiocese filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, alleging that the archbishop had virtually unfettered control over all of the entities, including the majority of the assets held by the Targeted Entities. The complaint further alleges that some of these entities were formed as a result of clerical abuse, such as a Ponzi scheme.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Minnesota today announced criminal charges against one of the targets of the alleged fraud.  On May 24, 2016, a federal district court in Minnesota entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the church from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.5 million, $2 million, and $1 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and orders the church to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint or denying any of the allegations, the Church and the Targeting Entities consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal statutes, ordering them to comply with the court's order, and ordering the churches and charitable organizations to pay $100 million in civil penalties. The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 2015).
