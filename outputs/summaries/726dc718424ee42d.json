  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a default judgment against a Greenville Police Department officer for his failure to serve process.  The SEC's complaint, filed on March 11, 2010, alleges that Officer Edney attempted to stop a vehicle in which Williams had been a passenger.  According to the complaint, Edney failed to respond to the vehicle's motion for relief from judgment and instead served the car's cashier with a copy of the summons and complaint.  As alleged, the complaint further alleges that, on or about July 5, 2015, Williams filed a complaint against Edney in the Washington County Circuit Court against him, alleging that he had failed to timely serve process on the officer and failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claim that he was not authorized to receive service of process for the entire police department.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Williams, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Williams consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $6,000, and requires him to reimburse the officer in the amount of $7,500.  Williams also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and ordered to pay disgorgement of $3,500 plus prejudgment interest of $1,500, and to pay civil penalties of $2,500 and $300, respectively.  On April 30, 2016, the court granted Williams's request for a continuance of the trial, which was scheduled for June 3, 2011, and granted him an additional thirty days from September 6, 2015 until the date of the judgment.   The court also granted Williams a temporary restraining order, ordering him to provide a copy to the court for further determination by the court upon motion of the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-11, July 22, 2015."
