  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon in possession of a gun and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on July 10, 2015, defendant Frankie Terrell Jones was indicted for the first-degree murder of Billy Ray Covington.  According to the complaint, Jones and his accomplice, Willie B. Nance, engaged in a long-running dispute about whether or not to strike a juror with a.40 caliber pistol because they were related to individuals who had been previously convicted by the state.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Jones was the sole defendant in the case and the only one who had ever been convicted of a felony.  In its Judgment, the Court held that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that defendants are entitled to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Jones consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $2,500.  Jones also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, with the right to reapply at a later date upon motion by the court upon motion of the court.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable William H. Brady of the United States District Court in Jackson issued an order suspending Jones from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Judge Brady granted the court's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of the background of the defendant and determine whether there is sufficient evidence to determine whether the defendant is a reasonable person to participate in a fair trial.  Justice Brady agreed to the appointment of a receiver to assist in this matter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mississippi Department of Criminal Justice, and the Mississippi State Attorney General's Office."
