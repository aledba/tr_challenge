  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, Marvin Scott used to own Golf Cars of Mississippi, L.L.C. (Golf Cars), a business that bought and leased golf carts. As alleged in the complaint, Scott had access to a personal guaranty that he had allegedly signed but failed to honor. The complaint alleges that Scott signed the guaranty and did not immediately file an affidavit stating that the signature was not a fake.  The complaint further alleges that, in 2008, National City Golf Finance (National) defaulted on one of its loans and Scott, his company, and his business partner, Curt Busching, filed for bankruptcy.  Scott was not entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(5) because he had already settled his stake in this case and agreed to pay $1.5 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced criminal charges against Scott arising out of the same conduct and circumstances that led Scott to settle the case.  On May 9, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Scott, charging him with violating Section 15(a)(1)(A) and Rule 15b2-3 thereunder, and with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Scott consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge $1,532, and imposes a $500,000 civil penalty, and requires him to pay a $1 million civil penalty in the amount of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Scott's attorney, Paul Revere, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
