  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a New Castle County man accused of stealing two DNA samples from an apartment complex.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, Dakai Chavis was the only person at Bode who was able to corroborate the findings of a recent criminal trial.  The SEC alleges that Chavis, who was arrested in November 2016 and later convicted of two counts of second-degree burglary and three counts of theft of a firearm, provided false testimony to the court in support of his conviction.  As alleged in the complaint, Chavis used a combination of non-testifying analysts' testimony to generate the final DNA profile.  In addition, the complaint alleges that one of the analysts, Sarah Siddons, corroborated Chavis's testimony by using a collection method known as buccal swabbing to collect skin cells.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Siddons consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.

At the same time, the Court issued a temporary restraining order halting Chavis from appearing before the SEC as a witness in a criminal case.  It also ordered the SEC to provide a copy of the final judgment, which is subject to court approval.  Finally, the SEC has issued an order requiring the issuance of an order imposing an injunction, ordering the destruction of any evidence in the case files, and requiring the appointment of an independent forensic analyst to provide an independent opinion on the accuracy of the evidence presented in the court order.  Among other things, the order requires that the court consider the merits of the case before it, including whether there is sufficient evidence to determine whether a defendant has committed a serious felony, whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a reasonable person has committed such a felony, and whether"
