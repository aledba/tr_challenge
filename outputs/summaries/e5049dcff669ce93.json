  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Maryland.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, defendants Gerald Johnson and Kenneth Jones were charged with conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering, in violation of the federal securities laws, and with obstruction of the jury selection provisions of the Exchange Act. The complaint alleges that Johnson, Jones, and seven co-defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of Exchange Act Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and (e) of Exchange Rules 5(b)(5) and(e) thereunder, and require the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, or any other jurisdiction, for a period of five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC charged the defendants with violating Exchange Act Rule 5b2-1. The SEC also charged Johnson and Jones with aiding and abetting Exchange Act violations.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a Remmer hearing. The court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, a temporary injunction, and an officer-and-director bar, and ordered the SEC to conduct an independent investigation into the conduct of the defendants. The investigation was conducted by David J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Mr. Barry and Ms. Barry, and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Baltimore Office of Criminal Investigations, the Maryland Office of the Attorney General, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Office of Financial Regulation, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, the Office of Compliance and the Maryland Department of State's Office of Inspector General."
