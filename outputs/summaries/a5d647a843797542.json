  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against the City of Danville Police Department and its former corporal in a related criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that, on February 24, 2016, Officer Shannon Conner was interviewed on the porch of a duplex by officers who were conducting a search warrant on the duplex. According to the complaint, Conner and her fellow officer, Corporal Valerie Jennings, planned to interview the suspect in a police vehicle when the weather changed quickly. Conner allegedly left the porch on the morning of the alleged incident, and the officers followed her instructions to conduct the interview on the inside of the vehicle. The complaint further alleges that Conner's actions exposed her to the risk of slipping and almost falling on wet grass while conducting the search warrant. The Commission's complaint charges Conner with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-officer injunctions against future violations of Section 65.2-301.1 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty against Conner. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the office of the Virginia Secretary of State's Office, with the assistance of the Office of Inspector General's Office's Office of Risk Analysis and Detection. The investigation was supervised by Scott A. Mascianica, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit, and John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit. The matter of compensability will be handled by the court."
