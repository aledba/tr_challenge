  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a medical malpractice defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 490.065 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 490.2 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Amy Revis, a resident of Kansas City, Missouri, attempted to cross-examine Dr. Brett Grebing, the on-call orthopedic surgeon at the time of Revis\u2019s injury, despite the fact that Dr. Grebing testified that he did not believe the injury was caused by pressure exerted by the bone fragment while awaiting surgery, or from the traumatic force of the impact when Revis fell from the ladder.  According to the complaint, the trial court did not err in finding that the evidence presented to the jury was inconsistent with the facts presented to it.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Revis failed to provide sufficient evidence to show that she engaged in tort reform activities while he was president of his local medical society.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Revis consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating these provisions and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and requires her to submit a reply brief and respond to a question about the reliability of her testimony.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-20, Litigation Bulletin No. 527-3d, July 21, 2018.  On August 2, 2019, the Honorable Kathleen M. Burns granted the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order against Revis and ordered her to return to the United States District Court in Jackson to determine whether to proceed with a criminal case against her.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Grebing on September 19, 2018, charging him with violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Rule 5a-14 thereunder of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against all of the defendants.  Additionally, the court granted a motion for preliminary injunction against Revis, ordering her to comply with the SEC order prohibiting her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any medical device, including a diagnostic device, and requiring her to provide an accounting of her medical history."
