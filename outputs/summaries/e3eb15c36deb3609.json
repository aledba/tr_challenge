  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon today announced criminal charges against a Beaverton woman accused of repeatedly refusing to comply with an officer\u2019s orders to remove her from the train.  The SEC alleges that, on September 2, 2016, Officer T.J. McNally of the Department of Justice issued a 30-day TriMet exclusion without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon.  According to the SEC, McNally failed to instruct the jury on passive resistance, which is when a defendant does not comply with a lawful order to remove herself from a vehicle.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant repeatedly refused to cooperate with the officers, including by refusing to stand up, get into the patrol car, and bend her knees to prevent the officers from putting her in the car.  As alleged in the SEC's complaint, defendant did not respond to the officers\u2019 requests for a judgment of acquittal on the basis of the passive resistance provision of the federal securities laws, and instead continued to struggle and scream at the officers until the officers came to her aid.  On October 2, 2017, the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against McNally, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered McNally to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $1,000.  Additionally, the SEC charged McNally with violating the anti-manipulation provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, an officer and director bar, and the return of any officer or director of a public company with the right to reapply as a result of a court order.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 206 (2014).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York today filed criminal charges in federal district court in the Western District of Washington.
