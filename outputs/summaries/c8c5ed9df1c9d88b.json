  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a temporary restraining order against a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, police officer and his employer from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 22.7(5) of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Des Moines, alleges that the City of Cedar Rapids and the officer who conducted the officer-involved shooting, Jonathan Gossman, violated the reporting provision of the state's securities laws by failing to comply with a court order requiring disclosure of police investigative reports. The complaint also alleges that, in a parallel action, the officer and the city agreed to the issuance of an order requiring the officer to provide a copy of the officer's investigative reports to the public. The court granted the officers' requests for an injunction and ordered the release of the investigative reports without the officer or the city's knowledge or consent. The defendants also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court denied the defendants' motion for a protective order.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered an order granting the defendants the right to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest in the settlement of the case. The order also prohibits the defendants from making materially false or misleading statements to the court in connection with the settlement.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $15,000, prejudgment interests of $1,500, and a $100,000 civil penalty. The settlements are subject to approval by the court. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Public Finance Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Iowa Department of Public Safety, and the Iowa Attorney General's Office in this matter.  For additional information, see Press Release No. 17-20-20, July 17, 2018."
