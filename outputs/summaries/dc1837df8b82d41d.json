  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Orando Ricardo Thompson, a former employee of Buddy's Seafood Market, who was convicted of second-degree murder in 2015.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that Thompson engaged in a physical altercation with Caleb Halley, an employee of the market, after Halley confronted Thompson about adding hot sauce and other seasonings to the gumbo Halley prepared earlier that day. According to the complaint, Halley replied that he would \"on't touch my fucking gumbo again\" if he had to defend himself. The complaint also alleges that when Thompson confronted Halley about adding seasoning to the gummy bears, he did not immediately provoke the use of force against himself. Instead, the complaint alleges that he went inside the market and retrieved the sword from the backroom, then returned outside to stab Halley three times in the abdomen. Halley was taken to the hospital, but he died as a result of complications from the stab wounds.  In a parallel criminal case, Thompson was convicted on the same charges and sentenced to life imprisonment. The SEC previously issued an order freezing the assets of Thompson and Halley and ordering them to be repatriated to their respective states.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Thompson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also ordered Thompson to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and ordered him to be barred from the securities industry for five years.  On the same day, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Thompson, charging him with violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and Rule 12b-2 thereunder.  It also charged Thompson with aiding and abetting Halley's and Thompson's violations of Rule 13a-1.   The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a penalty equal to or equal to the amount of any civil penalty imposed by the court.  To learn more about self-defense, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (Washington, D.C.)  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Miami Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigation"
