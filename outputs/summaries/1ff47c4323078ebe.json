  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against Wellstar Energy Assocs., LLC v. Friends of the Chattahoochee, Inc., a health care facility located in Smyrna, Georgia.  According to the court's order, Wellstar's complaint, filed in federal court in Cobb County, Georgia, alleges that the Commission Hearing Officer erroneously concluded that the panel hearing officer had \"lacked authority to independently decide if a facility is entitled to a new CON.\"  The court also ruled that the hearing officer could not independently determine whether a facility had an existing CON status.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Florida today announced that it had filed a civil injunctive action against the Commission for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint charges Wellstar with violations of Section 31-6-42 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Commission hearing officer has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Wellstar from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and requires him to comply with a court order prohibiting him from participating in any future administrative proceedings.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert C. Hannan of the Atlanta Regional Office granted Wellstar\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, freezing his assets, and ordering the Commission to conduct an independent review of the matter.  Hannan also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization.  A hearing officer will be appointed by the court to determine the scope of any administrative proceeding, whether to grant or deny an application for a CON, and whether to issue an order appointing a hearing officer to review the status of the facility.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-11 (2014).  The Complaint also alleges that Wellstar violated the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Georgia law, and that Hannan aided and abetted Wellstar and Hannan's violations of those provisions.  Finally, the Complaint alleges that, in its complaint, Hannan failed to adequately consider the issues raised by Wellstar in his review of a related administrative proceeding.  As a result, the complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar against Hannan"
