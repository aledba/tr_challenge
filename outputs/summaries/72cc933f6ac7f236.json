  "summary": "On May 28, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against Milo Worldwide LLC, a now-defunct radio and television company, and two other radio and TV companies, agreeing to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that, from at least May 2015 through July 2016, WMATA, through its licensing agreement with Milo Worldwide, refused to accept advertisements for a variety of commercial and noncommercial advertisements. The complaint alleges that WMATA's refusal to accept the advertisements violated its own advertising policy, and that the company's decision to remove the advertisements was unreasonable.  According to the complaint, the company also failed to disclose that the advertisements contained quotations and other references that suggested that the advertiser was not an advocacy group.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On June 26, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Last week, the court granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction and ordered WMATA to comply with the court's order. The court also issued an order temporarily freezing the assets of the companies and prohibiting them from issuing or selling any security-related advertisements to the public.   In its order, which was entered on June 27, 2017 and unsealed on June 28, 2016, the Court also issued a temporary restraining order, ordering the companies to pay a $75,000 civil penalty, and imposing an $8,500 civil penalty against each of them.  Additionally, the order issued on June 25, 2017 permanently enjoins WMATA from imposing any additional restrictions on the companies' advertising, including the issuance of a cease-and-desist order, imposing an injunction, and ordering the company to pay an $80,000 penalty. The order also imposes a $20,000 administrative penalty against the companies, and prohibits them from advertising in the public places where they are located.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the companies consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating these provisions, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any advertisements that may be deemed to be in violation of those provisions. The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2017."
