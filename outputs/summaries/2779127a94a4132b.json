  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Arizona-based attorney general Roland Burris in a related case.  The court entered the final judgment in favor of Burris' motion for summary judgment against the defendants, finding that Burris violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Burris to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the matter.  Burris agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to appoint a successor to Burris.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, Burris consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the federal laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests in the appointment of a successor senator, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty. Burris also agreed to pay a $20,000 penalty.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending Burris from appearing before the Commission on the Status of Women, which is subject to court approval. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Arizona, charges Burris with violating the antitrust provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(5)(B)(2)(A) and the appointment provision of Sections 206(1), 206(2)(B), and 206(3)(A), and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also issued a temporary restraining order against Burris and ordered him to comply with the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Arizona Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Arizona."
