According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, on April 5, 2016, a jury found that Mathew Brunk was not available to work because he had suffered a traumatic brain injury and was not able to perform any work. The SEC also found that Claimant had a specific recall date and had to pay a 25% penalty for not being able to work during the recall period.
