  "summary": "The Pennsylvania Association of Homeowners and Traders today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting construction of two pipelines in the Andover Community, Pennsylvania.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on October 2, 2017, Sunoco Logistics and Sunoco Pipeline, L.P. violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1511(b)(1)(i) of the Pennsylvania Securities and Exchange Commission.  The complaint alleges that Sunoco violated the right to build, operate, and maintain two pipelines, and that it failed to consider the prior use of the property as an apple orchard, which resulted in the presence of arsenic in the soil.  In its complaint, the Association alleges that the Township improperly relied upon the authority of a licensed professional engineer to determine whether or not the project was within its right-of-way.  Sunoco also allegedly failed to show that the property was in fact on the property when it was developed, and failed to check the soil before it was placed on the project site.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's order, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Philadelphia Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Eric Friedman of the Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Pennsylvania, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce, the Department of Environmental Protection, the State Corporation Commission, the Philadelphia Office of Inspector General, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Pennsylvania Office of the Secretary of State's Office."
