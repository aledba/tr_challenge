  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Newmans' motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing their assets, and ordering them to pay a civil penalty.  The court's order, which was entered on October 30, 2018, permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $38,985, $1,242, and $2,760, respectively.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in McKean County, Pennsylvania, the defendants failed to disclose to the hearing officer that they had violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal child support laws.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules of Practice, and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against them.  On November 21, 2017, the court granted the defendants' request for an emergency restraining order and ordered them to comply with the court's orders.  As set forth in the order, the relief order requires defendants to show cause why they should not be penalized by the court, and requires the defendant to provide an explanation as to why he or she did not do so.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Philadelphia Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Office of Advocacy and Public Education. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Sanson."
