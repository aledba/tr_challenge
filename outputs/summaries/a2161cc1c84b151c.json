  "summary": "The Honorable Donald W. Molloy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana has issued a certification order certifying a liability insurance policy that includes three types of coverage: (1) commercial general liability (CGL) coverage in the aggregate amount of $2 million, with a $1 million per-occurrence limit, and (2) commercial umbrella coverage (SDG).  The certification order, which was issued on October 31, 2017, alleges that High Country Paving, Inc. (High Country), a Bozeman, Montana asphalt paving company, was required to pay $3 million in advance of a settlement for a third party in an automobile accident without a release of liability for the underlying accident.  According to the SEC's order, High Country agreed to pay the $3.5 million advance payment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Montana, charges High Country with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against High Country for its role in a multi-vehicle accident that resulted in the death and serious injuries of at least one of the injured parties.   In its complaint, the SEC also charged High Country and its attorney, Nick Pagnotta of the Williams Law Firm, with violations of the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting to these violations, the complaint also alleges that United Fire violated Section 33-18-201(6), MCA, by failing to adequately investigate and respond to claims arising from the accident and failing to provide timely and accurate information to the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner and Glenn S. Gordon of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Montana Department of Insurance, and the Montana Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
