  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants were placed in the home of a mentally ill father who committed several acts of domestic violence and the mother failed to take protective action or otherwise cooperate with the agency.  In addition, the complaint alleges the defendants' statements about sibling visits were false and misleading, and the court improperly relied on unsupported assurances from the caregivers that they would allow future visits.  As a result, the court terminated parental rights as to D.O. and ordered her to live with her paternal grandmother, who is not related to the paternal grandmother.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  On August 1, 2014, the juvenile court granted the Defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return to their respective homes.  At a hearing on August 24, 2015, the Honorable Rebecca M. Welshhans, Judge of the Northern District of California, entered a judgment permanently enjoining Defendants from violating these provisions, ordering them to comply with the court's orders, and ordering the Defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000 and a $100,000 civil penalty in the amounts of $2,500 and $1 million, respectively, for each of the defendants.  A hearing on September 5, 2015 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. for the defendants, with the SEC continuing its investigation into the matter.   The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the San Diego Regional Office, and Assistant Director of the Office of Advocacy and Education. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Children and Family Services, the Department of Health and Human Services, and San Diego County District Attorney's Office in this matter."
