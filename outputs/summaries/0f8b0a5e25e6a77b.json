  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment in favor of Karen G. Davids, a Minnesota resident, in a civil injunctive action against the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, alleges that Davids failed to provide NRCS with sufficient evidence to determine whether the \"minimal effect\" exemption applied to wetlands located on farmland owed by Davids.  According to the complaint, Davids filed an AD-1026 form, which contained a recommendation that the federal agency \"shall\" consider whether the manipulation had a minimal effect on the wetlands in the area, including the value to waterfowl and wildlife.  Davids also alleges that she did not consult with the USDA prior to manipulating the wetlands.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court agreed to the final judgment, which permanently enjoins Davids from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of the Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct a full, independent, and expedited review of all of the agency's determinations concerning the effectiveness of the wetlands conversion.  On May 17, 2018, the Honorable Judge Kelly K.E. Mahoney issued a Final Agency Decision (FADR) that permanently restrains the agency from including Davids as a defendant in its determination of whether the wetlands should be subject to the minimal effect exemption, which requires the agency to consider the effect of the conversion on wetland function and value before it can determine whether it is exempt from the mandatory duty to consider whether minimal effect applies.  She also ordered the court to appoint a receiver for Davids to oversee the implementation of the remediation efforts.   The court's order also prohibits the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter or an order appointing an independent receiver for the wetlands, which Davids consented to. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center, with the assistance of the Division of Enforcement's Office of Environmental Health and Risk Analysis.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by David A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans."
