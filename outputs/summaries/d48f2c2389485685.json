  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed on April 9, 2018, alleges that, in April 2017, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California (D.C.), while conducting an examination of Mr. Dilone's application for naturalization, failed to make a determination on whether or not to grant or deny his application.  According to the complaint, after USCIS denied his application, the agency placed him in removal proceedings.  As alleged, however, the SEC's decision effectively deprived the agency of jurisdiction over the naturalization process.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 14(b) of the federal immigration laws.  In a parallel action, the federal district court that issued the order issued a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violating the federal provisions of \u00a71447(b).  The court also issued an order suspending the expedited filing of the complaint and ordering a hearing to determine whether to proceed with a hearing on the matter.  On May 17, 2017, a federal court in Brooklyn, N.Y., entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the agency from proceeding with a naturalization application while the matter is pending, and orders it to expedite the processing of the application. The court's order also orders the agency to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court, which is subject to court approval.  Separately, on May 24, 2019, the court granted the SEC and the D.C. Office of Immigration and Citizenship and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The order also provides for the issuance of an expedited court order requiring the court to consider the merits of the case before it is decided by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-19 (March 21, 2018).  In related matters, the Department of Homeland Security has issued a Notice of Exclusion (DOI) to encourage the public to check the backgrounds of people applying to become citizens by using the free and simple search tool on the agency's website. The Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone applying for an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0report\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00c2\u00a0success\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0institutional\u00c2\u00a0find\u00c2"
