  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against Safeway Insurance Company of Louisiana and its owner, DuJuan Johnson, for causing a house to flood.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants had a homeowners' insurance policy with State Farm Insurance Company, which paid $10,201.24 for repairs to the house. The complaint alleges that, as a result of the property damage, the plaintiffs were not entitled to damages for loss of use and inconvenience, but were entitled to compensation for mental anguish.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New Orleans today announced parallel criminal charges against the defendants.  On June 4, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, charging Safeway and Johnson with violating Sections 17(b)(5) and (7) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  To settle the SEC's case, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, entered a default judgment, and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $27,000, $1,500 for inconvenience, and $3,500 to each of the plaintiffs for each instance of bodily injury. The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering Safeway to pay $9,627 to repair the house, a total of $13,500, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Safeway consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil monetary penalty of $20,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for October 5, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2017."
