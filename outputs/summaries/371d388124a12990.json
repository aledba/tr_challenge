  "summary": "The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida today entered a final judgment ordering the sale of a Florida-based real estate company to pay a $103,600 commission to a broker.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Tampa, Florida, alleges that, on August 22, 2016, a federal district court in Florida issued an order requiring that the sale be conducted on a \"reasonable and timely basis.\"  According to the complaint, Appellant, who owned and operated a Kissimmee, Florida hotel, filed an application in the bankruptcy court for an asset freeze and other emergency relief.  On June 1, 2017, the court issued a final order approving the sale to a higher bidder.  Appelant and his attorney, Carlos J. Bonilla, Esq., agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of an order imposing a four percent commission on the higher bidder, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, on March 24, 2018, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of the company and appointing a receiver over the remaining assets.   The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Appellants to pay $103.600 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the broker-dealer's commission. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Banking and Securities."
