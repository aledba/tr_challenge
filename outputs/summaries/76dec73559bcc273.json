According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Alexandria, Robinson alleges that in 1960, Nels Nordquist and Jennifer D. Nordquist purchased real property at 404 Duke Street and 303 South Royal Street in Alexandria.

The SEC's order also prohibits Robinson from making any material misrepresentations or omissions in her filings with the SEC, and bars her from appearing, practicing, or appearing before the Commission on any matter that may arise from the Commission's examination or examination of her record. The court also ordered Robinson to provide an accounting of the amount of water damage to her property and to provide her with an account of the extent of the damage caused by the sprinkler system. The order also requires Robinson to submit a written account of her experience, including that she had not observed any water encroachment during the course of her work as a property owner, that she has not experienced any water damage during her time as a result of her employment as a licensed landscaper, that her access to the median had not been restricted by the"
