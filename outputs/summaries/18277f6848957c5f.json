  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment in favor of the Gwinnett County Board of Ethics against Commissioner Tommy Hunter, finding that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to rule on Hunter\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of an order from the court.  According to the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, filed in the Atlanta Regional Office on March 12, 2018, Hunter claimed that a trial court improperly removed a copy of the judgment from the record, which was improperly entered based on unexamined extrinsic evidence, and that he was entitled to a hearing on his motion to be relieved from the final judgment.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, Hunter filed a timely notice of appeal on July 17, 2017, which included the date the judgment was issued, the date it was subsequently vacated, and the date of the hearing.  In a parallel action, the Georgia Secretary of State and Attorney General's Office issued findings and a recommendation that Hunter be publicly reprimanded.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hunter has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  Hunter has also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500.  He also has agreed to the appointment of a receiver and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  To learn more about this matter, see Press Release No. 5-6-48 (2014)."
