  "summary": "On April 4, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana entered a final judgment against Montana-based midwifery providers for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 50-20-109(1)(a) of the federal health care law.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Montana, the Montana Department of Health and Human Services (MDHSA) issued a preliminary injunction in April 2018 to halt the practice of pre-viability abortions to licensed physicians and physician assistants-certified (APRN) in Montana.  The complaint alleges that, in the few weeks her clinic had been open, she had seen several patients eligible for a medication abortion who would have elected that method, but who were in the clinic when Cahill was unavailable and were unable to obtain the medication.  As alleged in the complaint, these patients became ineligible for the procedure because weems and Doe were not licensed to perform the procedure.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Montana today announced criminal charges against two midwives for their roles in the alleged violations of the state\u2019s anti-fraud provisions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against the defendants.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 519, No. 17-cv-01221 (March 21, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Health Division of the Montana Office of Health Education and Advocacy. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson."
