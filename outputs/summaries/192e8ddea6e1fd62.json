  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment against Mason J. Wells, Jr., a resident of Spalding, Nebraska, ordering him to pay $606.94 in restitution, $343.86 in pre-judgment interest, and a $1,500 civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Wells was present at a party on May 4, 2018, when a group of juveniles confronted Wells and told him to get out of the pickup. Wells complied, but was followed and overtaken by another individual who was also present at the party. The complaint further alleges that after Wells and the other defendants left the party, he continued to drink and hit and kick the four victims, who were then followed and confronted by Vanderheiden, who also entered a plea agreement and was sentenced to probation. The court also ordered Wells to pay restitution in the amount of $606,94 to W.F. and $342.86 to C.H.  Wells also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a civil penalty of $500,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Wells. Wells pleaded guilty to one count of second-degree felony and sentenced to a total of 17 years, 10 months, and 12 months of post-release supervision. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Wells agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Wells also consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws. The judgment also prohibits Wells from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security device, including a firearm, and from making or selling any offer of a security device. Wells has agreed to settle the SEC's charges against him by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a five-year officer-and-director bar. In a separate administrative proceeding, Wells was ordered to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $9,078, which is equal to the amount he has already paid in restitution to the victims. The final judgment orders Wells to be permanently enjoined from further violation of the securities laws, and orders him to be prohibited from serving any prison term. The sentencing hearing is scheduled for August 20, 2019. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Nebraska State Attorney General's Office, and the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services."
