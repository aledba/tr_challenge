  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against Williams LLC, a California-based construction company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rule 206(3) of 1940.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Williams, ordering her to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Williams.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Williams LLC violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal contract by failing to defend and indemnify the District in violation of the contract.  Williams and her LLC then filed an amended complaint, alleging that the District breached the indemnity provision, and that Williams LLC failed to show a probability of prevailing on its indemnity claims.  On June 4, Williams filed a second amended complaint against the District, this time in the form of an amended action, charging Williams LLC with violating the federal securities laws, and seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Williams and Williams LLC consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and from participating in any litigation arising out of the District's breach of contract or declaratory relief claims. The final judgments also order Williams to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of her ill-gotten gains plus interest, as well as a $10,000 civil penalty.  Finally, the court granted Williams LLC's request for an emergency court injunction, which is subject to court approval, and ordered Williams to comply with the court\u2019s order barring Williams LLC from serving as an officer or director of a public school district for five years.  It also ordered Williams LLC to provide a copy of the amended complaint to the court for review.  To learn more about indemnity provisions, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (2014).
