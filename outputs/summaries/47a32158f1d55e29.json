  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Cleveland Central Catholic High School on its unjust enrichment claim.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, alleges that Arvella M. Mills, a mother of a student who was also an enrolled student at Cleveland Central, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Mills was told that she was entitled to summary judgment based on her receipt of a $5,700 tuition voucher from Cleveland Central and that she would be responsible for the balance due on her daughter's tuition at the school.  However, the complaint alleges that Mills did not receive a voucher for Anderson's tuition and instead relied on a private school education provided by Cleveland Central.  In addition, the SEC alleges that when Mills enrolled Anderson in August 2013, she knew that the voucher she received would cover only part of her tuition for the 2013-2014 school year, not that she had to personally pay for the tuition.  As alleged, however, the school knew that she did not have a voucher and that the school had not notified her of that fact prior to her enrollment.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Mills consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $7,888.19, and bars her from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.
