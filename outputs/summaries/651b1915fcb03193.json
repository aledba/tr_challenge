  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the company and its owner in an accounting fraud case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, alleges that The Crabs Claw Inn, a restaurant and bar located in Lavallette, N.J., failed to maintain adequate books and records for the audited tax periods of 2007-2009 and 2010-2011.  According to the complaint, Saulwil, a career cook/chef specializing in seafood, and its restaurant manager, Samuel and Louise Hammer, agreed to a markup of $246,851 based on the number of transactions reported on the company's tax returns for the period October 2007 through September 2011.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, however, the complaint alleges that the markup methodology was unreasonable and unsupportable.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against the restaurant and its general manager for their roles in the accounting fraud.  On May 16, 2016, the court entered a judgment ordering the SEC to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and imposing an accounting officer-and-director bar on the restaurant.   The court's order also imposed a $500,000 civil penalty against the individual defendants, with the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Office of Financial Regulation."
