  "summary": "On August 5, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Scott Dyer, Jr. and his wife, Nelly\u2013Cerna Dyer (\u201cDyer\u201d) in a civil proceeding against them.  The court found that Dyer violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to award equal parenting time to both Father and Mother.  Dyer also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's judgment, Dyer consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Dyer.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 4, 2016 and unsealed on August 26, 2016 Dyer pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and ordered to pay $15,000 in restitution and a $100,000 civil penalty.  He was also ordered to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, pay a $10 million civil penalty, and pay a penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgment.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael Ivie and Carol Frost and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri Department of Children and Family Education, and the Mississippi Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
