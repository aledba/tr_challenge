  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment in favor of West Beach Condominium, Inc., a West Seattle-area condominium complex, against Commonwealth Insurance Company of America.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, alleges that Commonwealth violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, West Beach's claims were based on the discovery of, among other things, deficiencies in flashings, weather resistant barriers, and waterproofing transitions at elevated walkways and unit decks.  In addition, the complaint alleges that West Beach had been experiencing water intrusion issues for at least 10 years, and that the company failed to adequately investigate its claims.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the suit limitation clause does not apply unless and until a jury determines that no coverage exists under the two relevant policies.  Additionally, the Complaint alleges that, under Coventry Associates v. American States Insurance Co. of America, a federal district court in Washington, D.C., on September 26, 2016, the court granted West Beach\u2019s request for summary judgment against Commonwealth, and ordered it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its pre-judgment interest and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties equal to those imposed by the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Commonwealth consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders the company to pay $1.2 million in disgorgment, $1 million in prejudgment interests, and a $500,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Seattle Police Department, the Federal Insurance Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
