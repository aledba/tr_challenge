  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona yesterday entered a final judgment against Arizona-based nursing home companies and their general partners in a civil action brought by Arizona-area residents.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Mesa, Arizona, alleges that Preferred Care, Inc. (PCI) and its general partner, Pinnacle Health Facilities GP V, LLC (Pinnacle Health), violated the fiduciary shield doctrine by failing to adequately disclose to Arizona regulators that they were in the business of providing care to vulnerable adult patients at Arizona nursing homes.  According to the complaint, Scott and Riek were the only people in charge of the care facilities at the time of the alleged misconduct.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Scott was the general partner and the only person that could make decisions about the care facility\u2019s future operations.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, the defendants failed to disclose that they had access to information showing that the nursing home was underfunded as to staffing, thereby leaving the facility understaffed to the detriment of Ione Davis.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in the amount of $27,500,000, plus prejudgment interest of $2,965, and a $25,000 civil penalty.   The court also denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC complaint charges the defendants with violating the antiligence provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, penny stock, and penny stock bars against the defendants.  For further information, see Arizona Department of Health and Human Services Case No. 596, 2017 (Dec. 4, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Arizona Office of Inspector General, under the supervision of Joseph E. Casson and Julia McMillen.  This litigation will be led by John A. Pearce II and Ms. Gibson and supervised by Gregory A. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of Arizona Attorney General Brian J. Frohlich and the Arizona Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
