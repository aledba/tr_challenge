  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against defendants Alexander Remington, Cara Guri, and American National Holding Corporation (ANHC) in a fraudulent transfer claim.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, in 1997, Remington became a director of NewCom, Inc., now known as NCom, by purchasing an industrial building in Gwinnett County, Georgia and immediately transferring the property to ANHC.  According to the complaint, the defendants sought a directed judgment against Remington and agreed to settle the case by agreeing to pay a $2,533,000 civil penalty.  Instead, the court granted the defendants' motion for a directed verdict against the defendants, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, on October 30, 2017, the United States District Court in Atlanta entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Remington from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Remington to pay disgorgement of $1,100,000 plus prejudgment interest of $7,500, and a civil penalty of $750,000.  EMM Credit's complaint also alleges that the trial court erred in finding that Remington consented to the transferability of NCom's rights in a 1997 Settlement Agreement between Allstate and Remington.  As set forth in the SEC's Complaint, the jury found Remington liable for the fraud and ordered him to disgorge $1.4 million in ill-gotten gains plus interest, and ordered Guri to pay $500,000 in civil penalties.  Guri and Tony agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-reporting company, and Guri agreed to pay civil penalties of $250,000 each.  Finally, Guri has agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and ordering her to pay restitution in the amount of $3.5 million.  She has also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar, with the right to reapply after five years.  On October 29, 2018, the SEC issued a subpoena for a copy of the Judgment, which was unsealed on October 31, 2018.  This order prohibits the issuance, purchase, sale, or transfer of any documents related to the alleged fraudulent transfer of the property."
