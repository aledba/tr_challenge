  "summary": "On February 21, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on its decision not to issue financial responsibility requirements for the hardrock mining industry.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, the agency failed to consider the financial risks posed by the industry when it issued its financial responsibility rule in January 2017.  The complaint alleges that the EPA failed to account for the significant costs associated with the industry\u2019s financial responsibility obligations.  In its final action, the court ruled that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it violated the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC has agreed to the entry of a final order that permanently enjoins the agency from future violations of these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $111 to $171 million for each violation of the financial responsibility provision. The final order also orders the agency to provide a copy of the final action to the court for further determination by the court upon motion of the SEC.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Risk Analysis and Detection Center. The litigation will be led by John Rymas.
