  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) Director Kenneth Hetrick, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 935 of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, filed on January 1, 2014, the ODA improperly denied a rescue facility permit to a Perrysburg, Ohio man for failing to obtain a permit for his facility.  The court also found that, in violation of the reporting requirements under Section 936, the agency failed to consider the safety and well-being of the animals when it denied the permit.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against HETrick.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that, based upon evidence presented in the complaint, that the agency violated the reporting provisions of Sections 935 and 935. The complaint also alleges that the director of the agency improperly issued a search warrant and issued a cease-and-desist order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal reporting requirements, require them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and require the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-11-2014. \u00c2\u00a0On March 31, 2015, the court issued a temporary restraining order, ordering the release of all but one of the rescued animals, a bobcat, to be removed from the property.  On April 7, 2014 the court granted the request for an emergency court order to halt the pending issuance of a second emergency court injunction, ordering that the emergency court halt the issuance of the other emergency court orders, and ordering the destruction of any evidence that may have been obtained in connection with the earlier court order. The court's final judgment, which is pending final approval by the court, reserves the issue of whether to proceed with a permanent injunction against further violations of the anti-fraud provisions and orders the agency to conduct a \"pre-permitting inspection\" to determine whether it is reasonable and efficient to issue a permit to an animal.  It also ordered the agency not to violate the reporting provision of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering it to conduct an \"on-site inspection\" of the facility.
