  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of South Dakota today entered a final judgment against South Dakota and the City of Sioux Falls in a civil injunctive action brought by Landowners seeking to recover attorney's fees and expenses related to the flooding of their real and personal properties.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, filed an inverse condemnation claim in July 2010 against the state and the city of Rapid City for violating the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that the state violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that, as a result of the flooding, the State and the District of Columbia failed to provide reasonable attorney\u2019s fees or expenses to prevailing parties for their state inverse condemnation claims.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Landowners consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions, and orders them to pay attorney-and-adviser fees and other expenses as required by the federal law. The court also denied Landowners\u2019 requests for an award of attorney\u2018s fees.  On May 24, 2015, the court granted Landowners a temporary restraining order and issued an order suspending the issuance of an order temporarily restraining the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any property in violation of the federal and state securities laws, including the right to reapply after five years of litigation. The order also prohibits Landowners from seeking to have their claims dismissed by the court or by the state attorney general.   The court granted the request for an injunction and ordered Landowners to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-2-18 (January 2015).
