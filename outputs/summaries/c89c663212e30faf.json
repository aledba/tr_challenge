  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against General Motors Co. (\"GM\") and its former chief engineer, Stephen Kanas, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that GM misrepresented the track capabilities of the 2015 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 and failed to disclose that the Z06 had a \"track-proven\" cooling system that causes overheating, loss of engine power, and engine failure.  According to the complaint, GM also failed to adequately allege that it had a duty to disclose the alleged overheating defect.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, despite GM's representations to the contrary, Kanas and GM did not adequately allege GM knew of the overheating issue.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, GM has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the court has granted GM's motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 11, 2018, the Honorable Darrin P. Gayles granted the SEC and GM's request for a partial judgment against each of the defendants, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and a $100,000 civil penalty, and imposing a $75,000 bar on each of them.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (Aug. 2, 2018).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against GM.  Among other things, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against GM from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and from violating Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2), and 13(c) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-1 thereunder, and a civil injunction against the defendants from further violations of Sections 9(a) and 9(b).  The court also ordered GM to disgorge $2,038,078, which was deemed satisfied by the settlement without prejudice to the other defendants."
