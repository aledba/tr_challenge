  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of second-degree manslaughter and reckless homicide.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Johnny Bill Clark (\u201cJB\u201d) shot Todd Anthony Rowe (the deceased victim) in the back of the head in a residential neighborhood on January 9, 2016. According to the complaint, the defendant told Rowe that he was going to kill him because he believed he was about to use physical force to protect the other person from being harmed by Rowe. The complaint further alleges that the defendant allegedly told Rowe to \"get out of the way\" and \"I'm going to get him outside the house.\" The complaint also alleges that, in the minutes after the shooting, JD dragged Rowe\u2019s body from inside the residence to the outside of the residence and began to choke him. The SEC alleges that this conduct violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On January 10, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against JD, charging him with two counts of murder and one count of tampering with physical evidence, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of 35 years and a $75,000 civil penalty. The court also ordered him to comply with the SEC bar.  Last week, the United States District Court in Manhattan entered a temporary restraining order against Rowe, ordering the SEC to conduct a parallel criminal proceeding against him, and imposing a $25,000 penalty against him.  A hearing scheduled for February 21, 2020, was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. EST to determine whether to proceed with the criminal case against Rowe.  An SEC examination that led to the examination of Rowe's body, which was conducted by Rhonda Prince, was conducted in the absence of any evidence to support this finding. The case was supervised by Assistant Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Criminal Investigation Division."
