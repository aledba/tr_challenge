  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia today entered a final judgment in favor of Turner Construction Company v. Modern Mosaic Ltd., a firm specializing in precast concrete.  According to the court's order, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) entered into a contract (the \u201cPrime Contract\u201d) to construct a parking garage at the FBI facility in West Virginia.
