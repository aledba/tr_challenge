  "summary": "On March 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered final judgments against Safeway Insurance Company of Louisiana and Justin Semien in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on August 13, 2015, a Safeway insurance policy was issued to Demetrius Rubin and/or his son, Demetricrius Coleman, for coverage with respect to a 2002 Ford Expedition. According to the complaint, Mr. Rubin purchased the policy on February 26, 2016, the date of the accident. The complaint alleges that the policy provided coverage to the 1993 Town Car at the time it was added to the policy, and that, in the course of applying for coverage, he made material misrepresentations to Safeway regarding the condition of the car. The SEC further alleges that Mr. Semien did not acquire the car until the day after the accident, when he had sold it to Mr. Coleman.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Semien and Safeway for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (\"Advisers\") and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Semien consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $17,250, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 16, 2017, a federal district court in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, entered a judgment ordering Safeway to pay civil penalties of $2.5 million and ordering Semien to pay $1.2 million. The court also ordered the company to provide a copy of the final judgment to each of the relief parties.    In its order, the SEC also issued an order suspending the sale of any automobile that was not registered in the name of a resident of the same household, and imposing a $20,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Kelly L. Kasper and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the New Orleans Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Marshall."
