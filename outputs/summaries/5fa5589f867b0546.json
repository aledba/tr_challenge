  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Hawai'i today entered a final judgment against a Hawai\u2018i-based real estate developer who allegedly forged a deed.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Hawaii, William R. Hancock agreed to include in the conveyance documents an easement in favor of his neighbors that was not subject to a statute of limitations.  The complaint alleges that, after he executed the deed, Hancock misrepresented to the grantor that the easement was void and that the deed had not been forged.  Hancock also alleged that, as a result of the alleged forgery, the deed was void because it was not recorded in the public record.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hancock.  On August 26, 2016, the Honorable Joseph G. Gonsalves of the U.N. District court for the Central District of Hawaii entered a judgment against Hancock that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000 and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hancock consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge $10 million in ill-gotten gains plus interest, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against himself.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gossalves. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Hawai\u2019i Office of Financial Regulation."
