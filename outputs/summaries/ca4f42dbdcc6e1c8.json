  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Kansas City Power & Light Company (K&L) and its owner, Dogwood Energy, LLC (GMO), in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, Missouri, alleges that K&L and GMO violated the antifraud provisions of Section 393.170 of the Public Service Commission's (PSC) 1934 Rules of Practice for Electric Power.  According to the complaint, the PSC's 1934 Rule requires that an electrical utility obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity before beginning construction of an electric generating plant. The Rule also requires that a utility obtain an area CCN prior to the start of a project. The complaint further alleges that the Rule is unlawful because it imposes a burden on interstate commerce that is excessive in relation to the local benefits of the project.  In a parallel action, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued an order suspending the issuance of the Rule for a period of two years, which is subject to approval by the court.  On November 30, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action to halt construction of a power plant in Missouri. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and the court entered an order temporarily restraining the construction of the power plant. On November 29, 2018 the court granted a request for an emergency court order halting construction of any power plant or transmission line in Missouri until it finds that it is necessary or convenient for Missouri customers to use the electricity generating plant at their request.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, K&l and GMO consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them. The order also prohibits K&ll and GMO from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any electricity-related product or service, and from making any investment in a public utility. The Court also ordered K&LL and GMO to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.  K&ld&ldq.gov and $2,500,000 in penalties. The SEC&rdq.com and Stopaquila.org have also agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to the appointment of an independent receiver."
