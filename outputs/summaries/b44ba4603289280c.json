  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against Vernon Stinson, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for two counts of statutory rape and one count of child molestation.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Gwinnett County, Georgia, Stinson told the court that he was going to represent himself and waive his right to self-representation by filing a motion for discharge and acquittal. The complaint alleges that, on May 5, 2016, while incarcerated on the charges, the trial court granted Stinson's request for a temporary restraining order and appointed attorney Wesley Person as his standby counsel. Stinson then allegedly filed a motion to suppress, which the court denied, on the basis that the court improperly appointed Stinson as his counsel. The SEC alleges that Stinson refused to comply with the court's order and instead filed a pro se motion for a hearing on August 21, 2016. The court granted the motion for the hearing, which Stinson agreed to, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Stinson from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Stinson to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.
