  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against a former member of the Atlanta-area Bloods \u201cset.\u201d  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Atlanta, on April 13, 2011, Bryan Stewart and Kevin Culbreath of Mechanicsville, Ga., were arrested by Atlanta Police Department officers in connection with an armed robbery and carjacking. The complaint alleges that Redding, who was previously convicted on all counts of criminal street gang activity, was the driving partner of one of the men involved in the armed robberies. The SEC alleges that the two men were members of the Bloods, and Redding was a co-indictor of the armed robbery. The court found that the evidence was insufficient to support Redding\u2019s conviction for the Armed Robbery and that he was a member of both groups.  The complaint further alleges that, on the same day, Redding and Stewart left to pick up Chantal Jackson, a friend of his, from a club where she worked. The two women were later found in a car with red and black Ruger and a.45 Ruger on the backseat.  Redding also allegedly told the officer that he had received a text message from one of those men saying, well, yeah, it could have been a nine.  He also allegedly claimed that he did not see anything, but he later said that she had been woken up by Stewart as the robbery was happening.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $4,500. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney\u2019S Office for Atlanta today announced related criminal charges.  On May 24, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Redding. The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the SEC Division of Criminal Investigations.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Atlanta Field Office of Criminal Investigation, and the Atlanta Office of the United States Attorney General. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages the public to check the backgrounds of people who commit a crime by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a criminal enterprise."
