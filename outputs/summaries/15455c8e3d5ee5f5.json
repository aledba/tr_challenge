  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Great Western Drilling, Ltd. and Pathfinder Oil & Gas, Inc., a Texas-based oil and gas company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that Great Western sent a letter to Great Western on June 1, 2004, offering a 25% working interest in the new leases it acquired from Great Western.  As alleged in the complaint, Great Western did not have to prove that it was ready, willing, and able to perform the obligations of the contract.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the letter resulted in a breach of contract and required Great Western to pay the net proceeds of that interest, $3,053,023.40, to Pathfinder and to pay its attorneys' fees.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action, charging Great Western with violating the federal securities laws and ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Great Western agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions, and orders it to repay the amount of the penalty in a civil proceeding.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal, state, and local securities laws, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amounts of $9,968.98 and $4,078.98, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date by the SEC.  On August 11, 2010, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Great Western and Pathfinder to comply with the court's order.  McCole also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay civil penalties of $10,000 each.  Additionally, the court granted the request for an asset freeze and an officer-and-director bar, and ordered the payment of a $2,000 civil penalty.  Finally, the SEC issued an order appointing a receiver to deal with Great Western's alleged breach of the securities laws.    The court also ordered the receiver to sign a second JOA and a revised AFE for costs associated with the first well. "
