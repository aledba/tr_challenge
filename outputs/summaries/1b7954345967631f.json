  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a case-management order against Hamline University for failing to timely respond to Prewitt's motion for summary judgment.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Hamline violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from September 2009 to February 2014, Hamline improperly delayed filing of a complaint with the Commission on Education and the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") in order to expedite discovery efforts.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in response to Hamline\u2019s January 3, 2018, motion to compel and depose a Hamline representative, the court granted the motion to dismiss, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  On March 27, 2018 and April 9, 2019, the district court entered a judgment ordering the parties to respond to their discovery requests by the deadline set in the order, and the parties agreed that the court should defer consideration of the merits of the motion until after the discovery was completed.  Prewit, who was not named as a defendant in the case, filed a discovery statement in which he alleges that he failed to adequately identify the deficiencies in his discovery responses and that he was prejudiced by the late filing.  Hamline agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about race and sex discrimination in education, see Race and Sex Discrimination in Education Litigation Release No. 1211.
