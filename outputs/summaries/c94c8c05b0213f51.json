  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment in favor of a company that was previously denied an application for a special exception to build a communications tower in South Union Township.  According to the court's order, on May 16, 2016, Scott Devlin of Unified Business Technologies, LLC was hired by Verizon Wireless as a site acquisition/real estate consultant to evaluate the viability of a proposed tower in the area of Grace Brethren Church of Uniontown.  The court found that, contrary to the Board's finding, Devlin failed to present any evidence that the proposed tower constituted a public service facility and that it would substantially impact the health, safety, and welfare of the surrounding community.  In its judgment, the court also found that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Court's judgment, Scott consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, plus prejudgment interest of $2,065, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The judgment also prohibits Scott from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a security-related exemption, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On December 15, 2017, the Zoning Board of Supervisors of West Hanover Township granted the company's request for a temporary restraining order against future violations of Section 602.4 of the Township's Ordinance, which prohibits certain types of construction in an R-1 Zone, including public utilities and facilities.  It also prohibits the issuance of a \"special exception\" without first consulting the Township or Objectors, and requires the Township and/or Objectors to show sufficient evidence to justify the denial of the special exception application.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17.  Separately, the SEC issued an order suspending the issuance and offer of a civil injunctive relief against the company and appointing a receiver to determine whether to proceed with the construction of the tower.  A hearing on December 20, 2017 was held in the SEC's Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, with the assistance of the Office of the Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted"
