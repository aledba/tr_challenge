  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Redwood Falls, Minnesota man who was convicted of two counts of first- and third-degree criminal sexual conduct.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on August 13, 2016, a jury found appellant guilty of two felony counts of domestic assault, one of which was a first-degree felony, and one of a related conduct. According to the complaint, the jury was told that the defendant had \"repeatedly hit [M.P.] repeatedly in the arms and face and kicked her in her pelvic area.\" The complaint further alleges that the jury found that, while she was dating appellant over a ten-year period, appellant had physically abused her by punching, kicking, and throwing her against walls, causing her to need stitches. The court also found that appellant had engaged in a pattern of domestic violence in which he repeatedly hit and kicked M.P., causing her injuries. The complaint also alleges that one of the alleged assaults occurred during a single course of conduct, and that the state charged appellant with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On June 29, 2015, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Criminal Justice.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Keltner."
