  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of two felony counts of first-degree murder, attempted second-degree assault and related counts.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that, on January 24, 2017, Christina Warrick, the mother of three children, was shot and killed by Roland E. \"Bitch\" Fennell, a Maryland resident, while deliberating at a bus stop in Oxon Hill, Maryland.  According to the complaint, Warrick told her daughters that she was standing at the bus stop with three of her daughters when appellant approached her with \"the look of death on his face,\" stated \"bitch, you tell him everything,\" and then fired one shot at her in the face.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the court improperly exercised its discretion on the merits of the original motion for a partial verdict, and instead imposed a permanent injunction preventing the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Section 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Maryland today announced that it filed criminal charges against the defendant, charging him with violations of Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1. The SEC is continuing its investigation into the alleged misconduct of the defendant. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Maryland Office of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maryland State Attorney General's Office, and the Maryland Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
