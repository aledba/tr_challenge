  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was sentenced to prison for committing a series of high-risk carjackings.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in East Hartford, Connecticut, alleges that, on October 15, 1999, the defendant was released from the Manson Youth Institute, where he had been incarcerated for violating probation after having been convicted on charges of assault in the third degree.  According to the complaint, Johnson told the defendant that he was going to \u201cdo something\u201d that night, and that he would meet a friend and family member later to discuss the matter.  Johnson allegedly replied that he did not know why there was a restriction on the imposition of a life sentence for juveniles.  He also allegedly claimed that he had signed a letter of intent without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.

A hearing on May 25, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The hearing was adjourned until 10:30 a.m., when the defendant and his friend, Rashad Smith, emerged from the bushes behind the car.  Smith and Kelly, who were also present at the hearing, agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any federal or state securities laws, including the securities laws. The court also granted the defendants' request for an emergency court order requiring the court to consider the mitigating factors of a defendant's prior criminal conviction, including his family and home environment at the time of the alleged carjacking.   The court's order requires the defendant to"
