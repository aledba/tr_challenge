  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the widow of a Vacaville, California, life insurance company employee who died on January 1, 2010.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Michelle M. Sequeira, a full-time employee of the City of Vaclaville, was not entitled to benefits under a policy issued to her employer.  According to the complaint, the policy provided coverage to a full time employee who was hospitalized on January 2, 2010 and passed away the next day without ever returning to work.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the policy required the employee to perform his work responsibilities on New Year's Day or when he is sick in order for the policy to be effective.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the widow consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $275,000, which is equal to the amount of her husband's medical expenses.  On January 6, Sequeiras died after a short illness and his widow sought to recover $4,000 in premium payments for a supplemental life insurance policy that was not effective until his death on January 6.  She was not eligible for benefits under the supplemental policy because she was not on the job at the time the policy was issued.  As a result of the litigation, the settlement is pending final approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Lincoln National Life Insurance Company (Lincoln) for breach of contract and bad faith, and Lincoln has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of $75,000 and $100,000.  Lincoln has also agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval.  A hearing on the settlement was scheduled for May 21, 2013, and a hearing on June 20, 2013.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation of the matter was conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office, with the assistance of Assistant Chief of the Office of Insurance Regulation and the Division of Insurance Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit."
