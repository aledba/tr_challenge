  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services against the agency's request to terminate Shari's parental rights.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that Shari and her husband, Francis, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the Department sought a temporary restraining order and the appointment of a permanent managing conservator to prevent Shari from acting out with the children. According to the complaint, Shari agreed to the appointment without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and agreed to a permanent restraining order against her. Shari also agreed to be named a possessory conservator and to be required to continue providing support to the children in the event of an emergency. The settlement is subject to court approval. In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Shari. The SEC also announced that it would seek a court order halting the family separations and ordering Shari to relinquish her parental rights in a parallel criminal case. The court's order, which was entered without prejudice, prohibits the Department from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in the securities of any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The order also prohibits the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter or other emergency relief. The case is being handled by San Antonio Regional Office staff. The litigation will be led by Arden Dana and Ms. Rosetti and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
