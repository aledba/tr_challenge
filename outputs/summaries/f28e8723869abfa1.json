  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against Willie Joe McCall, Jr., a convicted felon, for his role in a 2015 attempted sexual battery of his stepdaughter.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that McCall violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, McCall gave the students a test containing several \"yes\" or \"no\" questions that asked if the victim had ever experienced child abuse or sexual abuse, and whether he had ever touched a child for lustful purposes. The test, which was conducted by Marie Frison, was designed to detect inconsistencies in the defendant's prior consistent statements. The SEC alleges that, based on the evidence presented to the jury, the jury was entitled to a judgment that permanently enjoins McCall from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Mississippi today announced criminal charges against McCall.  To settle the SEC's charges, the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations. The defendants also agreed to pay civil penalties of $5,000 each. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-20 (January 21, 2019).  The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Mississippi Division of Criminal Investigation.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center by Ray Morris of the Bolivar County Sheriff's Department, with assistance from Bertina White of the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Public Affairs. The examination was conducted with the assistance of a forensic interviewer, and the litigation was led by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Public Finance Abuse Unit. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and supervised by Mr. Karpel."
