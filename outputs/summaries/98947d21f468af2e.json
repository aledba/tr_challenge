  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against a St. Louis, Illinois man for his role in a drug-distribution conspiracy.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that David Bradford, a convicted felon, and his girlfriend Delenthegia Beard-Hawkins (also a felon) used intimidation and violence to conceal their drug-trafficking activities.  According to the complaint, Bradford also allegedly used a gun to carry out a series of high-level drug-related transactions, including one in which he shot up an apartment of a woman whose boyfriend had threatened him.  Bradford allegedly used the stolen marijuana to make the purchases, and the complaint alleges that he used the marijuana to \"shoot up\" the woman\u2019s apartment and steal her car.  In a parallel action, the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Bradford, finding him liable on all counts.    Bradford also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Bradford consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $1,500 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer and director bar.  He also agreed not to participate in the search of his home.  On June 9, Bradford was indicted on charges of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute controlled substances and six related drug-dealing and firearms related charges.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, he was also charged with possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug conspiracy and with aiding and abetting Bradford's conduct in the drug-dealer and dealer-in-possession transactions.  At the time of the search, Bradford had served as an informant in two other criminal investigations involving controlled buys and had been convicted of other felony charges, including for armed robbery and for making a false statement to a federal agent in connection with a drug dealer's purchase of a gun.  After Bradford pleaded guilty to those charges, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against him, and he was sentenced to 35 years in prison and ordered to pay $10,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, which was deemed satisfied by the court finding that Bradford was liable for the conduct of the other defendants in the two investigations.
