  "summary": "On April 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against Capital Telecom Holdings, LLC, a limited liability company that operates in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and constructs, owns, and manages wireless communications facilities in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on March 19, 2016, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office (ZHB) issued an order granting the ZHB's request for a dimensional variance and special exception to construct a self-supporting cell tower on which to place antennas.  The ZHB found that the proposed tower would be the least intrusive means for closing a significant gap in coverage in the Celleo Partnership d/b/a Verizon Wireless network, and that it would provide a wealth of other principal uses.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Capital Telecom has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Eastern Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against the company.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael R. Voorhees and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Department of Homeland Security today announced that it has obtained a court order requiring it to issue an asset freeze and other emergency relief.  On May 24, 2017, the SEC filed an order imposing a temporary restraining order against the issuance of any emergency relief orders, including an order appointing a receiver to provide emergency response services to the area where they are located. The order also requires that the receiver be located at least 50 feet from the property where the tower is proposed to be located, and the receiver to be positioned at a distance of at least 195 feet from adjoining properties. The court also ordered the receiver not to exceed the height of the tower and to provide access to a fenced compound where all associated equipment and equipment would be installed."
