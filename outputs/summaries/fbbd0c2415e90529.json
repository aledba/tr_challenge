  "summary": "On May 12, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Kentucky entered a final judgment against Janet L. Gunderson and Marc P. Herbener in a civil injunctive action brought by the Kentucky Department of Justice.  The court found that Janet violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered her to pay $54,222.70 in attorney's fees and $22,608.76 in costs for a total of $76,831.46.  According to the court's order, Janet failed to show sufficient evidence to support her claim that she was in contempt of court for her participation in the prenuptial agreement.  In addition, the court found Janet in contempt for entering the marital residence on February 25, 2017, without prior notice and removing items from the property.  Janet's motion for summary judgment against Marc was filed in federal district court in Louisville, Kentucky, on August 24, 2017 and unsealed on August 26, 2017.  As set forth in the court order, Marc and Janet agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins each of them from violating the federal laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their respective legal fees.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Janet and Marc have consented to final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering Janet to disgorge her ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay attorney\u2019s fees in the future.  Marc also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay a civil penalty of $160,913.00, a penalty equal to Janet&rsquo;s $100,000.00 penalty, a bar against Janet and a penny stock bar against Marc; and a bar prohibiting Janet from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any real estate in the United States, other than for her own personal use.  On August 29, 2018, the Kentucky District Court entered a judgment ordering the SEC to determine whether to issue an order imposing a temporary restraining order, imposing an order appointing a receiver, and imposing an officer-and-director bar on Janet.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by R. Powell and P. Rohan, and the litigation will be led by Ms. DeArk and supervised by Mr. Thompson."
