  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the relief defendants, Richard and Patricia Horne, who were ordered to pay $92,495.86 in attorneys' fees and $34,551.28 in administrative fees.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on January 10, 2011, Ms. Mantiply, an attorney for the Hornes, filed a motion in the bankruptcy court seeking to have an automatic stay of a court-ordered judgment against them.  The complaint alleges that the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 362(k)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, which requires the court to determine whether a defendant is entitled to a reasonable attorney's fee.  As set out in the complaint, the court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the defendants attorneys\u2019 fees, and instead relied on earlier-filed affidavits and billing statements attached to them to determine the amount of fees incurred in defending the defendants\u2019 default judgment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal fee-shifting provisions.  Defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently restrains or enjoins them from violating these provisions. Defendants also agreed to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amounts of their fees incurred as a result of the judgments. The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 17, 2011).  The SEC&rdquo.;s Complaint Bulletin No. 206-cv (January 18, 2011) (January 24, 2012) (July 24, 2013) (June 27, 2016).  In its order granting the defendants a temporary restraining order, imposing a preliminary injunction, and requiring the defendants to pay a civil penalty, imposing an accounting, and imposing an officer-and-director bar. The court also granted the defendants the right to request a writ of certiorari with the court ordering them to pay an additional $14,918.60 in fees incurred defending the judgment on appeal.  On May 10, 2017, the Court issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering the SEC to conduct an examination of the fees"
