According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fargo, North Dakota on April 28, 2010, the Honorable Judge James A. Pitt-Hart granted summary judgment against the defendants in a civil action brought by Robinson-Podoll.

In addition, the complaint alleges the defendants failed to inform the client of the potential error and failed to timely file a complaint with the court.
