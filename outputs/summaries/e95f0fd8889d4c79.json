  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin yesterday entered a final judgment against Johnson Controls International, Inc., a Wisconsin-based company, and its former Vice President of Systems and Services, Alex Molinaroli, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison, Wisconsin on April 6, 2016, the defendants agreed to settle a civil action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation by agreeing to pay a $5.5 million civil penalty.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  In its order, the court entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants, freezing the defendants' assets, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On June 27, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Wisconsin, alleging that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by failing to comply with certain of the provisions of the agreements, including the arbitration provisions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, and orders him to pay civil penalties in the amount of $5,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Wisconsin Attorney General's Office, the Federal Office of Inspector General, and the Wisconsin Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Department today announced criminal charges against one of the defendants in connection with a related administrative proceeding.  To learn more about arbitration, see Litigation Release No. 10-4(a).\u00c2\u00a0On June 26, 2018 the SEC issued an Investor Alert about a potential merger between Johnson Controls and Tyco International, LLC, which was subject to the same rules as the proposed merger.
