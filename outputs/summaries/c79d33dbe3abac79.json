  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a default judgment against Cuba in a civil case brought by Sherry Sullivan, the daughter of an American citizen who disappeared in Cuba in October 1963.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in the fall of 1963, Geoffrey Francis Sullivan and his son, Alexander Rorke, Jr., were shot down over Cuba in the course of a covert mission against the Cuban government.  According to the complaint, Sullivan's father was a member of the Cuban National Guard and was a licensed small aircraft pilot.  Sullivan allegedly told Sullivan that he had seen two Caucasians, including an American pilot, in a Cuban prison in 1963, and that his father had likely starved to death.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Sullivan.  On May 15, 2017, the U.N. Secretary of State's Office issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order against Sullivan from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Sullivan consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay disgorgement of $21,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $2,500.  She also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David J. Van Dyke of the New York Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The litigation will be led by Mark P. Sullivan and Ms. Sullivan."
