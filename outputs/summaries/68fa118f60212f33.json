  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment in favor of a Missouri man who sued Ford Motor Company for disability discrimination and retaliation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Kansas City, Mo., alleges that Jeremy Heuton, who was born without a left forearm and hand, was improperly told that he was unable to grip anything with his left hand.  According to the complaint, after learning that he had a congenital defect of his left upper extremity, Heuton was told that, at the time of his rejection, Ford regarded him as significantly restricted from performing either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes.  Heuton alleges that, despite having a full opportunity to do so, Ford did not consider that Heuton had an impairment sufficient to warrant a preclusion defense.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he failed to show that Ford had a reasonable basis for evaluating Heuton as having a disability because he had an impressive ability to adapt and perform many tasks, jobs, and services without difficulty.   The complaint further alleges that the complaint was not supported by the evidence presented in the SEC's summary judgment, which was issued on July 24, 2016.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the SEC consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Attorney General's Office in this matter."
