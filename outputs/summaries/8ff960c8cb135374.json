  "summary": "On August 18, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri granted summary judgment to Marcia Green on her claim of conspiracy to set fire to her mobile home.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boone County, Missouri, on July 6, 2015, Mehrdad and several alleged co-conspirators agreed to settle a civil injunctive action by the court against him by agreeing to a partial summary judgment against him.  The complaint alleges that, in the course of the litigation, the court improperly granted the motion for summary judgment because (1) the defendants agreed to burn down Marcia\u2019s mobile home, and (2) they paid a Mr. Reed and David Reed to set the mobile home on fire.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants also agreed to pay a $500,000 penalty for each of the defendants.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged scheme.   The SEC also announced that it filed an emergency action freezing the defendants\u2019 assets and ordering them to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $1.5 million, respectively.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their allegedly ill-gotten gains.  Additionally, the judge granted the defendants a temporary restraining order preventing them from further violating the federal securities laws, ordered the destruction of any evidence, and ordered the parties to provide a copy of the complaint to the court for review.  On August 19, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint against Marcia for her role in a related criminal case, and the court granted her motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Rule 17a-1, ordering her to comply with the court order, and requiring her to provide an accounting of her alleged losses.  To learn more about summary judgments, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 22, 2018).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations, Criminal Investigation, and Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Missouri Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office of Criminal Investigation."
