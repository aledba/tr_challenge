  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana yesterday entered a final judgment against Mark E. Thevenot, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 40 years in prison for domestic violence, ordering him to pay over $1 million in restitution and to pay a $2 million civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Indiana, on December 22, 2016, Theveno, who lives with M.B. in Deputy, Ind., told the court that he had a prior conviction for battery of a woman who was in a relationship with an abuser, and that he would beat her six months later because she \"throwed him in jail for six months.\"  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the alleged beating, he was able to get the woman out of the house and into the car.  As alleged in the complaint, however, as he was leaving the house, he kicked her in the face and kicked her, causing her to fall to the ground.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Thevenota.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office and the case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigation. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Indiana Department of Justice in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to quickly spot signs of misconduct.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Madison, Wisconsin, alleging that, in December 2016, Alyssa L. Gibson, a co-founder of the Indiana Coalition Against Domestic Violence, was the victim of a domestic violence attack.  Gibson, Gibson, and Sousone consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 thereunder. Gibson also agreed to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security"
