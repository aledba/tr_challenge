  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against San Diego Gas & Electric Company and Sempra Energy, Inc., a San Diego-based energy company, in a class action action brought by the victims of 11 California wildfires.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, California, on October 21, 2007, the defendants alleged that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to disclose to the court that they were members of a purported class of victims of the Witch Creek fire, Guejito fire, and Rice Canyon fire.  As alleged in the complaint, these claims were based on the false claims in the original complaint and were not tolled.  In a parallel action, filed on January 13, 2012, the court granted the defendants' motion for class certification, finding that the proposed class was not sufficient to toll the statute of limitations for certain of the claims.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the amended complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $2.5 million.  On February 2, 2013, the U. S. District Judge for the Central District of New York granted the Perkins' request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and a civil penalty of $500,000.  At the time of the judgment, more than 1,400 individual plaintiffs had filed class actions against the defendants, many of whom had been previously barred by the court from participating in any class action.  Among other things, over 1,500 individual claims were filed by the defendants in connection with their alleged involvement in a series of boiler-room boiler rooms that contained boiler rooms and other boiler rooms.  Some of those claims were tolled because, as alleged, the company had not received sufficient notice of the potential claims from the class members.  For example, one of the boiler rooms contained soot and ash deposited on various parts of their home and in their pool filter.  Another boiler room contained boiler room boiler rooms with boiler room equipment.  Finally, a boiler room containing boiler rooms containing boiler room and boiler room materials was not included in the class action complaint.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John R. Rymas and Eric R. Werner of the San Diego Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Ms. Perkin and Mr. Werner."
