  "summary": "On March 5, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against defendant Valentine V. Castillo, Jr., a Texas resident, for one count of continuous sexual abuse of a child and two counts of indecency with a child. The court found that Castillo violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found Castillo liable for two other counts of indecent assault.  According to the court's order, Castillo consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal, state, and federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 50 years and a $10,000 civil penalty.  Castillo also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Castillo. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, charges Castillo with violations of Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(3) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, Castilla has consented, without admitting, or denying, the allegations of the complaint, to entry of an order permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws and ordering him to comply with the court order.  On March 6, 2020, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, and ordered Castillo to surrender his passport and be enjoined from participating in any future solicitation of the sale or purchase of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of the proceeds of the alleged crime.  A hearing for Castillo will be conducted by Amy Ornelas, Chief of the Fort Worth Regional Office, under the supervision of John Rymas.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Amy S. Welshhans and Glenn S. Gordon. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the Texas Department of Criminal Investigation in this matter."
