  "summary": "On February 26, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the court against them.  According to the court's order, filed on June 11, 2015, Teresa Raney and Shirley Darnell acquired consumer credit card accounts issued by Citibank, N.A. (\"Citibank\"), wherein they were provided with specified lines of credit for consumer purchases in exchange for paying at least the minimum amounts shown on monthly billing statements.  The court found that Raney had failed to make the monthly payments on those accounts and was in default on the payments.  Raney's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleged that Midland Funding had purchased the accounts from CitiBank on October 14, 2014 and April 23, 2014, for good and valuable consideration, and that the Card Agreement contained arbitration clauses requiring the enforceability of the arbitration provisions.  In addition, the court ruled that the arbitration provision in the card agreement did not apply to all of the accounts.  As set forth in the complaint, the Court found that the parties violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $5848.91, $16,843.42, respectively, and ordering the parties to pay civil penalties of $1,000 each.  On March 29, 2016, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the Chicago Regional Office entered an order granting the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and imposing a civil penalty of $150,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Vassilkovska, Rhonda L. Schubloom, and Patrick J. McCluskey of the Illinois Office of Financial Regulation. The litigation will be led by Graham Loom and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Attorney General's Office, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
