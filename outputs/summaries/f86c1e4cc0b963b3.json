  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered final judgments against Texas Brine Company, LLC, its predecessor-in-interest, and another company in connection with a salt mine cavern collapse in Assumption Parish, Louisiana.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, Texas, Brine and Occidental violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Brine violated the arbitration provisions of Sections 9:4202 and 4303 of the federal securities laws, and that the arbitration provision is a \"delegation clause\" that the parties delegated to the arbitration panel to determine whether the salt lease terminated by confusion in 2008 was valid and valid.  In addition, the complaint alleges Brine failed to identify efforts to expedite the arbitration process by filing an amended incidental demand against the parties purportedly asserting claims based on a salt lease termination in 2008.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants failed to comply with the arbitration order, and the court granted the parties' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing an independent arbitrator.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas and Eric Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's New Orleans Regional Office, and is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Enforcement's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New Orleans and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
