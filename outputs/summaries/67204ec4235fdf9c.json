  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Joseph F. Roberts, Jr., a Texas resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, from 2002 to 2017, Aire Serv LCC, a now-dissolved corporation, operated an HVAC repair business in violation of the franchise agreement.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the alleged violations of the covenant not to compete, a portion of the company's revenue was lost and the company was unable to compete with other companies in the business.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Joseph.  On March 28, 2019, the court entered a preliminary injunction against Joseph and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Joseph consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $25,000, and ordering a temporary restraining order against him from participating in the offering of any securities in the future.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Office of Financial Regulation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
