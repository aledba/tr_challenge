  "summary": "On January 4, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment in favor of the San Diego County Office of Education and its former employee, Rodger Hartnett, in a second administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Palmdale, California, alleges that, on May 13, 2011, the Commission issued a writ of mandate granting Hartnetts reinstatement with backpay, interest and health care premium reimbursement, without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, and without requiring the Commission to conduct an investigation. The complaint also alleges that the Commission improperly determined the amount of backpay owed to Hartniett, which was not supported by evidence presented to the Commission. The Commission's final judgment, which enjoins the Commission from conducting an investigation or hearing, requires that the commission conduct a hearing and determine whether it is entitled to a full and complete investigation of the matter.  In its judgment, the court found that Hartniut violated the antifraud provisions of Section 45306 of the federal securities laws. The court also ordered Hartnut to pay $306,954.99 in disgorgement plus $72,251.44 in prejudgment interest, and ordered the commission to pay a civil penalty of $250,000.  On January 5, 2019, the SEC filed a second action, this time against Hartnet, charging him with violations of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  To settle the SEC's case, Hartniutt has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and ordering him to pay an amount equal to or greater than the amount owed to him by the Commission in the second action. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 30, 2011).  The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Education, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter. The Division of Education's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation was conducted by Scott A. Basinger and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner."
