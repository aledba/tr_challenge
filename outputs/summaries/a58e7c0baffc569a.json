  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the District Attorney's Office's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against the defendant.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the court improperly ruled that a video of an officer conducting an interview following defendant\u2019s arrest was highly prejudicial because the officer asked the defendant about his intent when he touched M.  According to the complaint, defendant used a number of hand gestures and facial expressions to communicate with the officer, including gestures in response to the question about whether defendant touched M during the interview. The complaint alleges that, almost immediately after the encounter on the MAX train, defendant and M began to talk about the alleged harassment and talking about his mental state during the incident. The SEC alleges that defendant replied, \"Oh, I never touched her.\"  The complaint further alleges that when confronted with the video, defendant stopped touching M and said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to lie.\u201d  The court ruled that the video did not show defendant in jail, but rather that he intended to do that by touching her leg. The court also ruled that defendant had an opportunity to tell the truth, but did not.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related matter, the SEC's investigation was conducted in the Office of the United States District Judge in Brooklyn, New York. The litigation will be led by Timothy J. McCole and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018."
