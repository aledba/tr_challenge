  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against Kentucky State Police Detective Brian C. Viergutz in a parallel criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bowling Green, Kentucky, alleges that, on June 6, 2016, a computer used by a Kentucky state trooper to search for child pornography on a peer-to-peer network and successfully downloaded four files containing child pornography from a single IP address. The complaint alleges that the trooper, who was conducting a computer forensics examination at the time of the alleged distribution, provided an inadequate answer to a question posed by the jury during deliberations.  According to the complaint, the trooper replied that he did not know that the files contained child pornography, but rather that he had looked at them and expected them to be there when he clicked on them.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that Moran had used BitTorrent, UTorrent, FrostWire, and Limewire to download the files, which were then shared with other users on the network.  Moran also allegedly used a private computer to access the network, which contained the files.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, however, the defendant did not share the files with others, and the file names and file names were not included in the shared download folder.  Instead, Moran allegedly accessed the network through his personal computer, which he used to browse the internet for the images and videos that he wanted to share with others.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC in its complaint, Moran consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a $100,000 civil penalty.  On May 9, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Moran and ordered him to return to his home, where he resides, to provide an accounting of his alleged unlawful distribution of child pornography.
