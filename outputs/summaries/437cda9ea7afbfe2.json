  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Alaska today announced criminal charges against Jason Ray.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in July 2014, Ray pleaded guilty to theft in the second degree and was sentenced to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment with 20 months suspended (4 months to serve), followed by 3 years of probation.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in federal district court in Anchorage, Ray agreed to be permanently barred from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 12.55.090(f) of the Alaska Probation Rules of Criminal Procedure.  In a parallel action, the Alaska Attorney General announced that Ray had decided to reject further probation, which he had previously agreed to, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, was a violation of the probation provisions of the federal securities laws.  Ray also agreed that the court should place little or no weight on the \"residence\" reading of the portable breath test, because it was inconsistent with what Ray had said at his probation revocation disposition hearing.  On appeal, Ray also alleges that the superior court improperly imposed a sentence which continued to include suspended jail time, and that the judge was required to impose a more severe sentence if Ray committed another felony.   The complaint further alleges that in Ray's case, the judge did not consider the evidence presented at the probation revocation hearing as sufficient to support the judge's findings that Ray was statutorily prohibited from rejecting further probation after he declared that he wished to reject it.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, Ray was not on probation at the time he made his decision, but rather on a probation revocation revocation hearing, when the judge granted Ray a temporary restraining order and placed him on unsupervised probation after Ray had completed a sentence of 16 months in prison.  Without admitting to these allegations, Ray consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  He also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar, with the sole condition that Ray comply with the terms of his probation and that he be subject to an aggravated sentence.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the Denver Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Alaska Department of Corrections in this matter."
