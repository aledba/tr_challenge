  "summary": "On February 3, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against a Bellaire, Ohio-based water and sewer company for its alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, on October 20, 2014, the Ohio Department of Commerce (\"DOC\") conducted mandatory drug testing on all of its employees, including Freddie Hocker, who tested positive for marijuana.  The court found that the DoC violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it had exclusive jurisdiction over the matter.  In its order, the court also entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the company, and ordering the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On February 2, 2017 the court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordered the company to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.2 million.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions and orders it to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the SEC.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
