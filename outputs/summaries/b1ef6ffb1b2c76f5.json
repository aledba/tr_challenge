  "summary": "On June 29, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Texas entered a final judgment against CitiMortgage, Inc., a Texas-based mortgage servicer, in a forcible detainer action brought by the Isaacs.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Austin, Texas, the defendants, Jerome J. Isaac and Michelle P. Isaac, the owners of the property, defaulted on their home loans in 2012 and the property was sold at a foreclosure sale in 2013.  The complaint alleges that Citi Mortgage and the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rule 206(3) and (4) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating these provisions and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the foreclosure sale.  On June 30, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  A hearing for the defendants is scheduled for July 17, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-221, No. 206 (1st Dist. of Texas), No. 207 (2nd Dist.).
