  "summary": "On May 24, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Bank of America, N.A., and two other defendants in a foreclosure action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 16, 2007, the BofA entered a default judgment without prejudice against the other defendants.  The complaint alleges that, in its default action, the Bank improperly accelerated the note and mortgage by failing to disclose that the Borrowers had defaulted on their obligations under the terms of the note.  In its default judgment, the court held that the Bank had the right, but not the obligation, to accelerate the note by five years from the date of the default, even if the default occurred within five years of filing the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Bank from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the Bank to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  On August 2, 2019, a federal district court in Miami entered a judgment against the Bank, finding that the default was not imminent and that it could not recover all the sums due under the notes and mortgage.   The court granted the Bank's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, and ordered the bank to comply with the court's order.  To learn more about asset freezes and other emergency relief, see Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0Investors.gov/securities.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Miami Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Banking and Securities."
