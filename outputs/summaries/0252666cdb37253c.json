  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Jodi Shulga, a widow who filed a third-party complaint alleging that she was unjustly enriched because she was receiving a pension as the surviving spouse of a disabled firefighter.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Evanston, Illinois, on May 19, 1991, the court entered an order dissolving the marriage. The court found that, under the terms of the marriage, Jodi was entitled to 50% of the pension and the other 50% was paid into the fund for retirement purposes.  The court also ordered Jodi to tender Jodi's share of the survivor's benefit payments for deposit into the client trust account of Mary's law firm.  Jodi filed a second complaint in April 2016, alleging that the court violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Illinois Pension Code (MSA) and Rules 5b-5 and 5c-8 thereunder, and that Jodi and Ronald were entitled to a constructive trust upon any death or survivor's benefits paid by the fund, including those related to Ronald's disability pension.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the judge agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Jodi from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $4,58.476. The judgment also requires her to submit an answer to the court in a timely fashion to determine whether to grant the civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mary. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that Mary violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b2-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On August 27, 2018, a federal district court in Chicago entered a judgment ordering the payment of a civil monetary penalty against Mary, ordering her to surrender her pension, and ordering the appointment of a receiver to determine the appropriate amount of relief.  A hearing on August 26, 2018 was held on the same day that the final judgment was entered, and the court granted the civil monetary penalties without prejudice to Mary and her husband."
