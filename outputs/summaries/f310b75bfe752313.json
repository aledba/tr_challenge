  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Burmese-speaking father for his alleged role in a recent domestic violence case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that, in 2013, a federal judge in Bangkok issued a temporary restraining order halting the father from participating in court-ordered alcohol and drug treatment programs.  According to the complaint, the court ordered the father to participate in a full drug and alcohol program with on-demand testing, a 12-step program, and a parenting program. The court also ordered that the father participate in an alcohol treatment program with an interpreter. The complaint alleges that father failed to comply with the court\u2019s order, and the court terminated custody of the children.  In a parallel action, on May 10, 2016, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California entered a final judgment against the father, ordering him to participate, without admitting or denying the allegations, in a case that was handled by the court.  On June 30, 2017, the federal district court in New York entered a preliminary injunction against father from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The order also prohibits the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter or other emergency relief, including an order to provide an interpreter or other suitable means for father to access the assistance of a court-appointed mediator. The SEC also prohibits any person from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in the securities of a public company, and prohibits the sale or purchase of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer and director bar against the defendant.  A hearing scheduled for May 20, 2017 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 24, 2020)."
