  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Shawn M. Miller, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for two counts of rape.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, on August 28, 2016, Miller was convicted of one count of rape and sentenced to a total of twenty-five years in prison.  The SEC alleges that Miller used standard deceptive techniques during the trial to convince the jury that he was being truthful and that he had not experienced any sort of trauma.  As alleged in the complaint, however, Miller had asked T.A. to go into his bedroom and pull her pants down.  After learning that T.a. had called her mother, Miller allegedly followed her into the bedroom and held her down and pulled her pants off.  Miller allegedly then went into the bathroom and licked off a piece of white cream he had put in her private parts.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Miller.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Miller consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, a $50,000 civil penalty, and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.  On May 24, 2017, the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordered Miller to return to the United States to be enjoined from further violating the federal securities laws.  A hearing for the SEC on July 27, 2017 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael Bolen of the Ohio Division of Criminal Justice, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case has been supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio State Attorney General's Office, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the FBI Criminal Investigations Division and the Ohio Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General."
