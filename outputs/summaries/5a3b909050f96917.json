  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee today entered a final judgment against Mahoganee Pelt, a Tennessee resident charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in 2015, Ms. Pelt filed a complaint in the general sessions court for Sumner County, Tennessee, alleging that the court improperly dismissed her writ of possession and ordered her to post a bond of $2,199, which included $1,681 in damages, $216 in anticipated rent, and $302 in circuit court costs.  According to the complaint, the court erred in including court costs as part of the bond and, after the tenant failed to post the bond, it improperly dismissed the writ of possessory bond.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Court of Criminal Appeals granted the complaint and ordered the court to issue a temporary restraining order and order against Ms.Pelt.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Tennessee today announced criminal charges against Pelt arising from her alleged violations of the antidrust provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(5) of The Securities Act, and entered a permanent injunction against her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  On January 14, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a court-ordered injunction, and appointing a receiver to determine the amount of bond and other emergency relief. The court granted the receiver's request for an emergency court order, and the receiver agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1.6 million. The receiver also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $192,865.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 24, 2016.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018, No. 17-cv-01, (Aug. 13, 2015).  The Court granted the receivers' request for a temporary injunction, ordered the receiver to post bond, and ordered GHA to recalculate rent and other charges as they became due during the litigation. The jury deliberated for three days before issuing a judgment that permanently enjoins Pelt from future violations of Section 5 of the securities laws, and orders her to pay $1 million in civil penalties and $2 million in pre-judgment interest. The judgment also prohibits her from associating with any third party"
