  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found liable for driving while under the influence of intoxicants.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that, from at least 2013 through at least 2015, defendant Matthew J. Bessett, a registered representative of the Oregon Department of Health and Human Services, falsely claimed that he had a blood alcohol concentration of at least 0.08 percent when, in fact, he had never had a BAC of that low.  According to the complaint, however, as alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant had a history of driving with a high level of alcohol, and had been stopped for riding a motorcycle without a helmet.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant had used a chemical test to measure his BAC at the time of driving to determine whether he had reached peak BAC.  As a result of this finding, the court found that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requires them to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations. The court also granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oregon State Corporation Commission, and the Oregon Bureau of Criminal Investigation in this matter.  For further information, see the SEC Complaint Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The Court of Appeals also issued an order appointing a factfinder to evaluate the safety and efficacy of certain of these measures, including, among others, the accuracy of the BAC determination by the court as to whether a defendant had been impaired by alcohol in the prior breath test or by a subsequent breathalyzer test. The Court also appointed a receiver to assist in the investigation of the matter, and appointed an officer and director of the agency.  On May 24, 2016, the Honorable Judge Robert A. Hannan of the District of Columbia entered final judgments ordering Hannan to comply with the court's order.  Hannan agreed to the order and agreed to a permanent injunction against further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws."
