  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil action brought by the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York against the defendant.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Inglewood, California, alleges that, in 2008, the California Department of Public Works (DPS) issued an order requiring the county to award a franchise to the lowest responsible bidder in a competitive bidding process.  According to the complaint, the DPS issued the order without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  In its order, DPS also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the receiver of the franchise to determine whether to award the franchise based on the criteria set forth in the Commission's Rules of Practice for Public Procurement.  DPS has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the receiver to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by Eric Werner of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
