  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Alaska today announced criminal charges against a commercial fisherman accused of driving while her license was revoked.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Anchorage, Alaska, alleges that Celesty Noel Farmer violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Farmer was charged in 2013 with third-degree criminal mischief for cutting the ropes to a boat while it was tied up at the dock in Klawock, Alaska. The complaint alleges that Farmer agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint. Farmer also agreed to pay restitution in the amount of $499.99, which is $9,797 higher than the amount she was ordered to pay in the criminal mischief case. The SEC alleges that the jury found Farmer liable for the lesser included criminal mischief charge but found her guilty of the lesser charged criminal mischief. The court also ordered Farmer to pay $1,800 in labor costs related to the repair of the keel shoe and keel cooler tubes of Yates\u2019 boat.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Farmer that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $500,000, and imposes a $10,000 officer-and-director bar against her.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Sansone of the Federal Court in Anchorage granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Farmer and ordered her to comply with the court's order. The order also prohibits Farmer from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with a criminal case, and prohibits her from serving as an officer or director of a public company or association with a registered broker-dealer. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Farmer also has agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws and ordering a conduct-based injunction against her from further violations of those provisions, and to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to her pre-judgment interest.   The settlement also requires Farmer to provide a copy of the judgment to the court for further determination by the court upon motion of the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office."
