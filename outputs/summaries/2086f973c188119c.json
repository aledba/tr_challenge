  "summary": "On September 13, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against a former employee of a Bexley, Ohio-based real estate investment firm who was convicted of stealing millions of dollars from investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that Mark J.P. \"Mark\" Appellee, who was formerly employed as an accountant for a B.C. Realty Consultants, stole approximately $753,792.10 from investors in the company.  Appelle pleaded guilty to theft in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 2929.12 of the Exchange Act, and ordered to pay $350,000.00 in restitution.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against appellee.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on September 12, 2018 in federal district court in Bowling Green, Ohio and unsealed on September 13th, appelle pled guilty to one count of identity theft and was sentenced to eight years of community control.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, appelmanlee consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $1.4 million civil penalty, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On September 14, 2018 at the sentencing hearing, the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordered appellees to pay disgorgement of $1,253,078, which is equal to the amount of restitution he has already paid to the victims of the alleged theft. The court also granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction, which requires the court to determine whether to impose a permanent injunction, impose a conduct-based injunction, or impose a community control sanction.  An SEC order appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver will be instituted upon motion of the court. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Department of Justice in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release Order No. 17-cv-01221, July 17, 2018."
