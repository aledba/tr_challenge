  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of NextEra Energy, Inc., a Texas-based energy company, and its subsidiary, Energy Future Intermediate Holding Company, LLC (EFIH), in an emergency action to restructure the company.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 19, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order granting the parties a temporary restraining order and ordering the payment of a $275 million termination fee.  The court's order, which is subject to court approval, requires the parties to pay the termination fee in the event that the court declines to approve the merger.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court agreed that the Termination Fee provision was an allowable administrative expense under the federal securities laws, and that it should be waived when the court deems it necessary to do so.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced parallel criminal charges against Nextera and Energy Future.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Office of Financial Regulation in this matter."
