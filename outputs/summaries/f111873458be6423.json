  "summary": "On January 23, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico entered a final judgment against the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, ordering them to pay $5,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Juan, Puerto Rico, alleges that the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, and State Plant Health Inspection Service (PHIS) violated Section 7756(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 7702(c) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the preemption provisions of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against SFC.  According to the complaint, SFC agreed to settle the charges by consenting to permanent injunctions and to pay a civil penalty of $7,500.  SFC also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, or promotion of any type of agricultural product, including coffee, tea, or dairy products.  On January 24, 2019, the court entered a temporary restraining order and ordered SFC to comply with the entry and sale of any coffee plant that may be affected by the imposition of a preemption order.  A hearing scheduled for February 5, 2020 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 5, No. 613c (a) (b) (B) and (c) (D.P.R. 2016).  The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Puerto Rico Office of the Secretary of Agriculture."
