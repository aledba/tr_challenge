  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Teamsters Local 2010, a California-based labor union that represents skilled crafts employees at two of California's largest universities.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that on January 1, 2018, Teamsters filed an unverified civil complaint against the University of California, Los Angeles, alleging that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that Teamsters failed to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on its claim because the federal government had exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether or not to use state funds to support or oppose union organizing. Teamsters also alleges that, in a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office (AGO) issued an order freezing the salaries of certain members of Teamsters' groups at both UCLA and UCSD. The AGO's order, which is subject to court approval, also prohibits Teamsters from engaging in noncoercive activity, including, but not limited to, filing a civil action against a public employer for violations of the federal anti-fraud provisions. The court's order also prohibits the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter or an order suspending or freezing the salary of any employee organization, including the right of a public employee to participate in the formation or administration of an employee organization. The SEC also requires the employer to provide an explanation for why it may not use the funds for this purpose.  In addition, the SEC's order prohibits the use of state funds for the purpose of evaluating whether a company is an unfair labor practice, including whether it is reasonable to believe that an employer has a reasonable probability of winning a court-ordered strike.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the university consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, and orders the university to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000.00 per employee. The university also agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  Teamsters has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and ordering it to comply with the Commission's order. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office."
