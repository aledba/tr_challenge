  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Indiana today announced criminal charges against a former employee of a liquor store accused of stealing a $2 million ticket from the Hoosier Lottery.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Indianapolis, on October 3, 2014, Ashlee Campbell, now known as Ashlee Parsley, of Plainfield, Indiana, presented a winning scratch-off ticket from a game called \u201c100 X the Cash.\u201d The tickets were larger than the norm: approximately nine inches long and three and a half inches wide. The tickets had prizes of $20, $20 and $20. The Lottery had suspended Parsley's license to sell tickets from May 24, 2014 to September 26, 2014 for paperwork issues, and Parsley was supposed to have returned all the tickets to the Lottery on the morning of October 1, 2014. Instead, Parsley allegedly used the proceeds to purchase a house, a vehicle, and a truck for himself and Ashlee. The complaint alleges that Ashlee and Joseph purchased the tickets at a different convenience store in Plainfield and purchased a house and vehicles for themselves, and that they transferred some of the remaining prize money between bank accounts. Parsley also allegedly told an investigator that he did not buy the tickets, but rather used the money to make purchases at the convenience store. The SEC alleges that Parsley violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Department for the Central District of New York today announced parallel criminal prosecutions against Parsley. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, Eric R. Werner, and Glenn S. Gordon of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Werner."
