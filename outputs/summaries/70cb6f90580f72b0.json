  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against Sunland Park, Inc., a New Mexico corporation that seeks to incorporate Santa Teresa, New Mexico, as a municipality.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Do\u00f1a Ana County, N.M., on September 19, 2016, the court found that, under Section 3-2-3(B)(3) of the federal securities laws, an existing municipality has the right to determine whether it can provide municipal services within the territory proposed to be annexed.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the proposed municipality has no right to annex the territory.  In addition, as alleged in the complaint, the complaint further alleges that the proposed municipal entity is not permitted to incorporate the territory as a separate municipality until it has met certain criteria in the municipal services plan for the territory, such as whether the territory is contiguous and \"may be provided with municipal services more quickly.\"  The court also ruled that, if the municipality does not meet those criteria, it is entitled to a hearing on the merits of the proposed annexation petition and to a judgment ordering the city to comply with those criteria.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, DABOCC and the city of Santa Teresa agreed to the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the district court agreed to appoint an arbitration board to determine how to proceed with the annexation proceedings.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Salt Lake Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson, Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gaunt.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Mexico Department of Finance and Administration, and the New Mexican State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
