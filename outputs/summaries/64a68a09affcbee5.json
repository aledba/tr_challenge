  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas on May 3, 2019, entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) against them for unreasonable delay in the adjudication of U Visa applications.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that the USCIS violated the antifraud provisions of Section 555(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1940 and Rule 12(b)(6) thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 5 of the APA, USCIS failed to act on its obligations to adjudicate U visa applications. The court also found that USCIS had no jurisdiction to determine whether to grant or deny an application for U Visa, and that the agency had no right to suspend or deny a U Visa application for any reason.  In a parallel action, the United Kingdom's Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The U.K.'s Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced related criminal charges.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on July 31, 2019 and unsealed on August 3, 2020, the court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, an expedited hearing, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the expedited processing. The SEC also issued an order suspending the issuance of an emergency court order temporarily restraining the issuance, purchase, or issuance of any emergency relief.  On August 5, 2019 the court issued a final order suspending USCIS' unreasonable delay and refusing to issue work authorization to certain of the alleged violators of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from future violations of the anti-divergence provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and ordering USCIS to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The order also prohibits USCIS from issuing work authorization without a court-ordered injunction, and prohibits the agency from issuing or denying an order requiring an officer or employee to perform their duty to process a U visa application. In addition, the order prohibits the issuance and issuance of non-disclosure agreements, which are subject to court approval. The Court's order freezes the assets of USCIS, the agency that issued the order, and the agency issuing the order. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Kelly"
