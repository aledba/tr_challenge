  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada today entered a final judgment in favor of Nevada against the United States Department of Energy's (DOE) plan to ship one metric ton of defense plutonium or defense plutonium materials from the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina to the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS). The court found that Nevada failed to establish a significant likelihood of irreparable harm to the public and the environment by failing to prepare a draft and final environmental impact statement for the NSS. The court also ruled that Nevada's motion for preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval, was in the best interest of Nevada and the public. The Court's order, which was entered without prejudice, permanently enjoins Nevada from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Nevada to submit a supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) by January 1, 2020.  The court's order also prohibits Nevada from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in the sale or purchase of any security-related product.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Nevada. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Las Vegas, charges Nevada with violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction against Nevada from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, offer, or promotion of any material, non-destructive, or environmentally friendly product, including the right to reapply for a penny stock bar at a later date.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Nevada has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering Nevada to comply with the requirements of Section 5, and ordering it to submit an EIS by January 31, 2020, for which it has agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar. Nevada has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer and director of a public power company. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  According to the SEC, the court will determine the amount of money to be provided to settle the case."
