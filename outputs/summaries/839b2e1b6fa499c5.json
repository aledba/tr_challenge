  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against Novato Healthcare Center, Inc., a California-based nursing facility, for conducting an unfair labor practice.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Novato violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, on September 16, 2015, a supervisor at the facility questioned four employees about their plans to participate in a union-opposition campaign. The complaint alleges that Narvius Metellus and Rolando Bernales, the four employees who allegedly slept on duty, confronted the supervisor and told him that they would not participate in the union's representation election if he did not participate.  In a parallel action, on October 12, two days before the November 14-15 representation election, the federal district court for New York entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the employees\u2019 assets, and ordering Novato to pay a civil penalty of $160,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Novato consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders it to pay civil penalties of $150,000, and bars it from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On October 19, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a penalty equal to the amount of any civil penalty. The SEC previously issued an order freezing the assets of Novato and prohibiting them from participating in or participating in any union-related activity.  Today, the court granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction, ordered a conduct-based injunction, and ordered the company to comply with the court order.  Separately, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Metellaus, Bernales and Sabelino.  A hearing scheduled for October 24, 2017, was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. and 8:30 p.m., with the SEC seeking a hearing on the matter.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger of the New York Regional Office, and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Werner."
