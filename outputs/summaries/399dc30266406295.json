  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against defendant Charles P. McCullough, Jr. for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that, on November 9, 2015, McCullough filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, seeking to have Judge Nauhaus suspend or revoke his right to a jury trial.  According to the complaint, the court granted the request without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint and instead ordered McCullough to provide a partial waiver of attorney-client privilege.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against McCullough.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed on November 19, 2015 in the U. S. District Judge Lester G. Nauhaus of the Philadelphia Regional Office, the complaint alleges that McCullough engaged in ex parte communications with a judge during the pendency of his trial, including one in which he allegedly requested that the judge revoke the defendant's bond and order him to surrender his passport.   The complaint also alleges that the court improperly appointed a third judge to preside over the hearing, which was conducted by a judge who was not a member of the court. \u00c2\u00a0The complaint charges McCullough with violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting, however, that the complaint seeks a preliminary injunction, an officer-and-director bar, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer and director bar.  McCullough has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his legal fees.  On November 20, 2016, Judge Naustein granted the motion for an emergency court order suspending or suspending McCullough from appearing before the court as a witness, and ordered him to provide an accounting of the alleged misconduct that occurred during the course of the hearing.  He also agreed to the appointment of a judge from outside of the country to determine whether to hold a hearing on the merits of the case.  Judge Nauhus also agreed not to impose a penalty of $100,000, which would be subject to the court's approval.  Finally, Judge Sullivan agreed to a hearing-by-mail bar and to the issuance of an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.  Sullivan agreed"
