  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Melissa Kelley-Hilton, the former Executive Vice President of Bishops Services, which provides services such as pre-investment due diligence and executive-level pre-employment investigations.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, in 2011, Kelley-Sheil joined Sterling as an executive vice president of financial and business services, and that she signed a series of agreements with her former employer, Sterling Infosystems Inc. (Sterling). Among other things, the complaint alleges that she was wrongfully terminated without cause in 2011.  According to the complaint, in 2012, when she was hired as Sterling's CFO, she was terminated with or without cause without cause.  In 2013, the SEC charged Sterling with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On December 3, the New York Court of Appeals granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval, and ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of the company's policies and procedures to determine whether to impose a civil injunctive action.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the Exchange Act, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000, $50,000 and $50 million, respectively. The SEC also ordered the company to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  A hearing is scheduled for December 5, 2017, for which the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office today announced criminal charges against Kelley-Heil.
