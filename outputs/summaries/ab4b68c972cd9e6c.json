  "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing litigation action brought by an insurance company and a hotel in Oklahoma.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma, alleges that Siloam Springs Hotel & Casino West, Inc. (S.L.C. ) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its order, the SEC alleges that the company and the hotel violated the federal district court for the first time in its history.  According to the complaint, the hotel sought coverage under the policy, and the insurance company denied it access to that coverage because it was unable to resolve the jurisdictional issue before the court could properly determine whether any federal jurisdiction existed.   The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Oklahoma announced criminal charges against the hotel.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, the court granted the hotel a temporary restraining order, ordered the hotel to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and ordered the company to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500. \u00c2\u00a0The hotel also filed an emergency action in which it was barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any offering of any type of insurance, including securities, in violation of the federal securities laws.  On May 24, 2014, the Oklahoma state court granted summary judgment in favor of the hotel in a related administrative proceeding against the same company, which the SEC previously ruled against.  As a result of the court order, all of the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000 or more.  Additionally, the defendants consented to entry of final judgments that impose permanent injunctions against future violations, with the final judgment requiring them to comply with the federal law.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 17, 2013).    In a parallel administrative proceeding, the Nevada state court issued a preliminary injunction on January 17, 2014 against the company, denying the hotel's motion to reopen the case, and ordering the district court to issue an order appointing an independent receiver to oversee the litigation.
