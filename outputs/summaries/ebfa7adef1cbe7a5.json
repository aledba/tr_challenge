  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (\"Keurig\") and its former CEO for making materially false and misleading statements in connection with the proposed merger.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on May 2, 2014, Keurigs Green Mountain and its then-CEO, Kevin Koonin, issued projections for the company's upcoming fiscal year that were materially misleading.  The complaint alleges that Keurige Green Mountain's Board of Directors and its senior management knew that the 50% probability weighting was objectively false because it was based on \"flawed and inaccurate data\" and that the company heavily discounted its projections for upcoming fiscal years.  As alleged in the complaint, the company continued to tout and publicly rely on those projections through fall 2007.  In addition, the complaint alleged that the analyst had learned from confidential informants that, in early 2006, he had a \"false and misleading\" view of the future prospects of the company and that he was incompetent, a bad analyst, even careless.\"  The court also found that the defendants' representations to investors were inconsistent with the facts presented in the proxy statements.  For example, the SEC alleges that, at a meeting 44 days before the launch, the analyst shared with the Board updated versions of the projections without applying a weighting, which he knew was inaccurate.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14a-9, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7'78u-4(b)(1) thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against each of them.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a separate case, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Kohnin. \u00a0 The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
