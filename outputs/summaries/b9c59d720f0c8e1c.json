  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against IQ Formulations, LLC and Europa Sports Products, Inc., which are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that IQ and Europa sold to retail investors in the form of \"adulterated\" dietary supplements.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to adequately allege that the supplements they purchased were worthless because the FDCA prohibited the sale of supplements containing new dietary ingredients.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants did not directly allege that they suffered an economic loss when they purchased the supplements because they paid a premium for them.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, IQ, Europa, and Debernardis have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  Finally, the court granted the defendants\u2019 requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.K. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
