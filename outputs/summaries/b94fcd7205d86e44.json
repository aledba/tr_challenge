  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered final judgments in a case brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York against a defendant who was sentenced to life without parole for the deaths of his mother, father, and brother.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that, in 1996, a federal district court in Washington, D.C., entered a final judgment against defendant Brian Bassett, Jr., who was convicted of three counts of aggravated first-degree murder.  According to the complaint, Bassett was living in a \u201cshack\u201d with Nicholaus McDonald after Bassett\u2019s parents \u201ckicked [him] out\u201d of their home.\u201d  The court found that, at the time of the murders, the mandatory minimum sentence for juveniles was grossly disproportionate to the severity of the punishment at issue.  Bassett has since been sentenced to three consecutive terms of life with no possibility of parole or early release.  In a parallel action, on April 25, 2017, the U. S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia entered a judgment against Bassett that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the court also ordered Bassett to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and ordered him to repay the restitution in a civil monetary amount.  On April 26, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver of the receiver.   The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Alabama Department of Corrections in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 567.030 (3)(a)(i).  The Commission on Juvenile Justice previously issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent review of mandatory minimum sentencing for juveniles.  This review was conducted in the Office of Advocacy and Advocacy for Children under the age of 18, and supervised by Scott A. Kasper."
