  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Georgia Pacific Consumer Products LP (\"GP\"), a now-defunct Alabama-based consumer products company.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on June 17, 2014, while operating a \"ram truck\" and performing the duties of her employment, Sheryl D. Gamble suffered an injury to her back and neck when the truck became inoperable and ran into a guardrail. According to the complaint, the trial court determined that Gamble was permanently and totally disabled when she reached maximum medical improvement (MMI) on June 9, 2017, the date she reached MMI. The complaint further alleges that Dr. Givhan, a licensed professional counselor, recommended that Gamble undergo a cervical diskectomy and fusion surgery, which, the complaint alleges, did not reduce Gamble's pain and caused her to require additional assistance in recovering from her June 2014 accident. The court also ruled that, based on the evidence presented to the court, Gamble was entitled to future medical benefits as provided by the Workers' Compensation Laws of the State of Alabama as existing on June 29, 2014. In its judgment, the court found that Gamble violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered GP to pay for all of Gamble's medical treatment, including requiring her to file a costs bill with the clerk within 45 days of the entry of the judgment. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, GP has agreed to the judgment, which is subject to court approval, to a permanent injunction, to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Office of Inspector General in this matter."
