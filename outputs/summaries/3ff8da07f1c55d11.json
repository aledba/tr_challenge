  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Travis H. Travis, a California resident, for his role in a recent drug-related criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Tulare County, California, alleges that Travis violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he failed to comply with the requirements of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  According to the complaint, Travis also failed to provide timely and accurate information to the court regarding whether Travis had violated Section 5, and failed to timely file a writ petition with the court.  Travis also allegedly failed to show up for court-ordered family reunification services because he was not able to obtain a criminal exemption and, therefore, could not be assessed for placement.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Travis.  On January 27, 2016, the court granted Travis a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return to custody on March 13, 2015.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Travis failed to respond to a telephone call from a social worker advising him of the need to seek an emergency court order to remove him from the custody of his mother, Jonathan H., and Christopher H. from his home.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint filed in the court, Travis consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating Section 5 and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  A hearing scheduled for May 11, 2015, was scheduled for Travis and Cheyenne, but Travis did not respond to the phone call.  After the hearing, Travis agreed to a voluntary family maintenance case where he was scheduled to spend the night with the children and receive hands-on education along with monitoring the mother\u2019s ability to provide for the children.  He also agreed to be allowed to participate in community services provided by CWS.  To learn more about child custody, see Child Advocacy and Advocacy.gov.

The Court granted Travis's request for a second day of couplet care on March 24, 2015 and a hearing on May 8, 2015 for Travis to show that he had completed the required drug testing.   The court also ordered Travis to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and"
