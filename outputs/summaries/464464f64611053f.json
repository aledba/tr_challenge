  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a former software development and management executive for his role in a tax fraud.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that John Rankin violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Rankin failed to file tax returns for his businesses, including by failing to disclose that he had been disbursed money from his companies as \"tangible wages\" and \"research and development\" compensation without reporting it as income.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Rankin misappropriated information sought by IRS employees attempting to ascertain income, expenses and taxes for Rankin and his various business entities and interests.  Rankin also allegedly failed to disclose to the IRS that he was disbursing money to himself and Rankin Enterprises, classifying the monies obtained by Rankin as ordinary income, not constructive dividends, and failing to report them as income when he was aware that there was a pending IRS action.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint,Rankin consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $5,079,343, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The final judgment also orders Rankin to pay disgorgement of $7,101,018.72 plus prejudgment interest of $2,160, and a $1,000,000 civil penalty.  On August 2, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Rankin, ordered him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, and imposed a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States or abroad.  A hearing for the SEC is scheduled for May 24, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.   The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
