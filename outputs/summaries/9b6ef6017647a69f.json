  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the school district's motion for preliminary injunction against J.A.W. Whitaker, a seventeen-year-old unemancipated minor who was previously barred from using the boys' and girls' restrooms at school.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, J. A.W., a transgender student at North High School in Evansville, Indiana, alleges that he was denied access to the girls' and boys' restrooms because he identifies as male.  The complaint further alleges that, as a result of his delay in seeking a preliminary injunction, he has suffered significant distress relating to his distress.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Education today announced that it had issued an order requiring school districts to permit transgender students to use the girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 restrooms.  As alleged in the complaint, this order violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Whitaker consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal and state laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.  Additionally, the court granted the district's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits it from issuing or selling any security or other emergency relief, as well as an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar.  On August 2, 2018, the Court granted the District Attorney's Office's request to appoint a receiver to determine whether to issue an emergency asset freeze and a civil injunctive relief order.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Smith and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Smith and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Indiana Department of Education in this matter."
