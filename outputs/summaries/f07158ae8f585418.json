  "summary": "On November 2, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing defendants' assets, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that defendants failed to adequately disclose to a jury that a motor vehicle accident resulted in a serious stroke.  According to the complaint, Kamal Sadek, who was driving a limousine that was hit by a bus, suffered a stroke on October 2, 2006, and was taken to St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital, where he was diagnosed with an embolic stroke. The complaint alleges that Dr. Nabil Yazgi, a neurologist who served as director of the Stroke Center at New York Presbyterian Hospital, raised the possibility that plaintiff's stroke could have occurred as a result of the impact of the accident on his body.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  To settle the SEC's charges, the defendants agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendants consented to a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to comply with the court's order, and requiring them to show cause and effect of the alleged injunctive relief obtained by the SEC.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants an emergency asset freeze and ordered the destruction of any evidence that may have been obtained in connection with the alleged accident.  On November 3, 2011 the court entered a judgment ordering the SEC to hold a hearing in which it would determine whether to proceed with the motion against defendants based on the evidence presented in the complaint. The court also ordered the SEC and the state Attorney General's Office to conduct an examination of the evidence in the case. The SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eileen A. Rakower, J. Lauchlan Washburn, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Washburn and Ms. Welshhans. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5,"
