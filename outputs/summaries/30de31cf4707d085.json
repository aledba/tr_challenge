  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against Corizon Health, Inc., a private prison medical services provider, in a civil injunctive action brought by the New Mexico Department of Corrections.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, N.M. on January 23, 2018, alleges that, in May 2016, the district court granted a writ of mandamus to Corizon, which was granted on July 18, 2016.  According to the complaint, Corizon provided medical care to inmates in a series of contracts with the Department of Justice, including one that required an attorney to represent the inmates in the litigation. The complaint alleges that the settlement agreements were not subject to disclosure under the federal securities laws, and that the District Court improperly failed to determine whether the settlements were public records.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced that it filed an emergency action to stop Corizon from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 14-2-6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14-3-1 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On January 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the federal district court in New Mexico granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and issued an order requiring Corizon to comply with the court's order. The court granted the request without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations. The order also prohibits Corizon and its attorneys from making any improper or misleading statements to the court in connection with the issuance of the emergency action.  Separately, on February 13, 2016, a federal district judge in Albuquerque issued a final order granting the SEC request for an emergency court order to hold Corizon liable for any violations of the anti-fraud provisions. The Court also issued an emergency order suspending Corizon for a year and ordering it to produce documents to the SEC that would support the SEC finding that it violated Section 14 of the Exchange Act. The same day, the SEC issued a subpoena for documents related to the release of records related to civil injunctions related to misconduct by corrections officers in the department of corrections. The subpoena also requires the SEC to provide an accounting of the amount of attorney fees paid to each individual defendant. In its order, the court also ordered Corizon's attorney to provide a copy of the requested documents. In a separate order issued on February 24, 2017, the U. S. Attorney for New Mexico announced criminal charges against two corrections officers. The criminal charges were later dropped. The"
