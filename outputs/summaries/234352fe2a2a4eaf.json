  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Dale Goshaw and his liability insurer, Auto-Owners Insurance Company, for failing to properly perform his duty of ordinary care in inspecting or maintaining an apartment building.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Eau Claire, Wis., alleges that, in October 2013, Smith was injured when a fire escape outside of his apartment building collapsed.  According to the complaint, Smith requested a modification to the standard jury instruction regarding a landlord\u2019s duty of reasonable care to a tenant, Wis JI-Civil 8020 (2013). The modification added: \u201cEvery building and all parts thereof shall be kept in good repair.\u201d  The complaint further alleges that Smith failed to check the fire escape connections and painted the interior of the building to prevent dry rot.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of their respective monetary penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Wisconsin today announced criminal charges against Smith arising from the same conduct that led to the SEC's earlier criminal charges.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the U. S. District Judge's Office issued a temporary restraining order, which prohibits defendants from making materially false or misleading statements to the court in connection with their criminal actions. The SEC also issued a civil injunctive relief order, ordering the SEC to conduct a parallel criminal investigation, and appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation.  A hearing on June 5, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2018)."
