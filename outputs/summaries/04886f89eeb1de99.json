  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Pike Company, Inc., a construction contractor based in Poughkeepsie, New York, for breach of contract.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan on April 20, 2018, Pike agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his or her compensation.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  In its order, the court also ordered Pike to submit a written response to a complaint filed by Tri-Krete alleging that it had violated the arbitration provisions of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Pike has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a $1,000,000 civil penalty to be determined by the court upon motion of the court.  On May 24, 2019, the Court granted Pike's request for a temporary restraining order and entered a default judgment against him, ordering a preliminary injunction, and ordering a hearing on June 26, 2019.  To learn more about arbitration, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 17-CV-2406 (March 21, 2014).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Market Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter, as well as the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations.
