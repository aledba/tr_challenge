  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, Washington, alleges that Nazi Yishmael, who is not an attorney, advised his clients that they could \"homestead\" in apparently abandoned homes and, after a period of time, acquire title through adverse possession.  According to the complaint, after some of his clients were arrested for taking up residence in other people\u2019s homes, they were charged with and convicted of felony unlawful practice of law.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an emergency court order halting the proceedings of the federal district court for the Northern District of California.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $7,000, and requires him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest of $2,500.  Yishmeel also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and ordered to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, which is equal to the amount of his civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Boerner and supervised by Marc Blau of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Seattle Police Department, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
