  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Utah today entered a temporary restraining order against two Utah men accused of stealing over $2 million worth of cars.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, Abdul R. Kisana and two Utah-based automobile dealerships agreed to settle a civil injunctive action by the court against them for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of the federal securities laws, Kisana sold the cars in advance of being paid by buyers for the cars without obtaining any equitable relief.  As alleged in the complaint, the cars were not retained by the dealerships and were sold to third parties without their knowledge or consent.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Utah today announced criminal charges against Kisana.  On January 19, 2020, the court granted a preliminary injunction against the defendants and ordered them to comply with the court's order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas and Eric R. Werner of the Salt Lake Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Attorney General's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
