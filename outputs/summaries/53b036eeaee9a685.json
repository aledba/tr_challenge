  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bennington, Vermont, alleges that, on January 11, 2016, Martin's Mini Mart employees Anthony Falace and Scott Galusha were approached by two masked men who demanded that they drop a $1,700 bank deposit. The complaint alleges that Mr. Mayhew and his sister, Vanessa Garcia, followed the two men into the parking lot of Citizen's Bank and demanded that the defendants drop the deposit.  According to the complaint, the men were heavy-set, had a \"special relationship\" with not only state and federal investigators, but also came to live with Ms. Garcia after the robbery. The SEC also alleges that the men had a history of committing bank robberies, including one in which they were caught on video with a gun.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $960,000, prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil penalty of $250,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Vermont today announced criminal charges against Falace.  Among other things, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest from the defendants.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 20, 2019).  The case is being handled by David J. Williams, Esq., Barbara A. Masterson, Joseph R. Perella, and Kathryn L. Gottschall of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Williams and Ms. Grossman."
