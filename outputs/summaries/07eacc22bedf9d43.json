  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against the City of Charlestown, Indiana, and the entity that administers the Property Maintenance Code (PMC).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis on January 24, 2018, the City and the entities that enforce the PMC are unlikely to succeed on their claims that the city is not required to follow the PMCs.  The complaint alleges that the City violated the federal and state building laws in 2008 and 2009, and that the UBL and PMC provisions violated the city's prerogatives to enforce the federal, state, and local laws.  In its judgment, the court found that, based on the plain language of the federal laws, the city violated the PMc, the prerogative of the city, the antifraud provisions of Section 36-7-9-1, the building safety requirements and the Privileges and Immunities provisions of the UML.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws, orders them to pay civil penalties of $2500 and $1000, and orders the city to pay a civil penalty of not more than $1000 every ninety days. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David Keith and Ellen Keith and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Joshua Craven, Tina Barnes, David Keith, Ellen Keith, and Joshua Bolder of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Indiana Department of Health and Human Services (DOHSA)."
