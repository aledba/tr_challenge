  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the widow of a former state senator who died of fibromyalgia.  The court found that, in 2011, Davina Gebauer, who was 42 years old when she first applied for Social Security benefits, was not disabled.  According to the court's order, the widow, who had been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and suffered from chronic fatigue and chronic fatigue, complained of fatigue and pain in her back, legs, and arms. The court also found that Davina had \"poor exercise capacity\" and suffered severe impairments in her ability to perform work in the national economy as a letter addresser, document preparer, and call-out operator.  As alleged in the court order, in assessing Davina\u2019s condition, the judge relied on testimony from a vocational expert who had worked as a trainee, police dispatcher, emergency-911 dispatcher, and switchboard operator. The judge also ruled that, under the demanding standard of complete disability under the Social Security Act, a person with disabilities could pursue a claim for benefits that should have been paid before her death.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Court Order, the Judge granted the widow and her husband the right to proceed with the litigation.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court also ordered the widow to pay a civil penalty of $20,000.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges the widow with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the widow.  On November 2, 2018, the Honorable Kathleen L. Gibson of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the widow from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay civil penalties of $10,000, and requires her to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar on Davina.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-34(a)(2).  The Court also ordered that the widow be allowed to apply for and receive a penny-per-share of her husband's pension with the assistance of a certified physical therapist, a certified public accountant, and a certified financial planner. \u00c2\u00a0The court also issued a temporary restraining order against Davina"
