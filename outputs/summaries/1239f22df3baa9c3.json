  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Sandra P. Magana-Ortiz, a Joliet, Illinois resident, ordering her to pay a civil penalty of 24 months' imprisonment.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Will County, Illinois, alleges that, on December 23, 2014, defendant, Margarita Saavedra, a mother of three children, and her son, L.M., who was seven months old at the time of the alleged abduction, made an unrecorded oral statement and written statement in which she described how she and Juan Melendez had been married since June 23, 2013.  According to the complaint, while Mariela was on the phone with Juan, she allegedly confronted him about the custody order and told him that she had full custody of the children and that she was going to call the police.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Saavedras.    The complaint alleges that defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Eric Moyes and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
