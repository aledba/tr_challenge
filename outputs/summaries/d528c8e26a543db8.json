  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment in favor of a Texas-based charter school and its owner in a civil injunctive action brought by the Texas Department of Education.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas on November 18, 2013, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (Paxton) and his company, Basis Schools, Inc. (Basis), raised the issue of governmental immunity under the Charter Schools Act of 1940.  Paxton and Paxton agreed to settle the case by agreeing to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 12.1056(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 12b-5 thereunder.  The final judgment also permanently enjoins Paxton from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders Paxton to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, plus prejudgment interest of $2,037, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Paxton.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Paxton consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions, and ordering him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and a $20,000 officer and director bar. Paxton also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for a period of five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Texas Office of Education in this matter."
