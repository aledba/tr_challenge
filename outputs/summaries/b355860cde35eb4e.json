  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Rockside-77 Properties, L.L.C., a commercial landlord, and its president and general manager, Peter Butler, finding that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that Rockside failed to prove its obligations under the lease by failing to make timely and full payments to Partners, and that Butler was entitled to a credit against the amount owed by Partners.  According to the court's order, the defendants failed to comply with the terms of the lease and failed to pay the full amount due to Partners. The court further found that the defendants violated the anti-fraud provision of Section 15(a)(1) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by not making timely and/or full payments of rent to Partners and failing to pay late fees and late fees.  In addition, the court found that Defendants failed to adequately record and record all payments made to Partners in the lease, including payment of base rent, late fees, common area and maintenance charges, electric, storage, non-sufficient check fees, and work orders.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay civil penalties of $35,500, and bars them from serving as officers or directors of any public company, and orders Defendants to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $2,929,829, and a civil penalty of $49,000.  On May 31, 2015, the Court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, offer and sale of any security, including the right to reapply as an officer or director of a public company at any time. The Court also granted the parties' motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2)(A) and (B) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Defendants. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper."
