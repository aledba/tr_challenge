  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Chris Cortazzo and Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage Company for breaching their fiduciary duties in a real property transaction.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles on May 8, 1986, the SEC alleges that, from at least 2006 through at least 2008, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC further alleges that the defendants failed to disclose to prospective buyers that the real estate agent selling the property was acting as an exclusive agent in the transaction and that the agent acting as a dual agent had no duty to act as such to the seller.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2008, when the SEC filed a complaint against the broker, the broker and its associate licensees, both of them failed to inform the buyers that they were acting as dual agents in a transaction and therefore did not owe a duty to the broker.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the two defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties against each of them.  On May 9, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Los Angeles District Court entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants, freezing their assets, and ordering the broker to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Ostrove and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the San Francisco Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
