  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Amica Life Insurance Company, Inc., a Colorado-based insurance company, and its owner, Martin Fisher, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that the Colorado General Assembly delegated the power to an administrative agency to determine whether to adopt a two-year suicide exclusion standard for insurance policies sold in Colorado.  According to the complaint, in 2004, the Colorado legislature passed a law requiring the state Department of Insurance to adopt regulations that would effectively override Colorado statutory law.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in 2014, Amica issued a ten-year convertible level term life insurance policy to Martin Fisher. The policy was in the face amount of $500,000 and named Wertz as the beneficiary. The complaint further alleges that Amica misrepresented to the Commission that the policy was reasonable and just when it should have been.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Amica from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Amica to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Amica has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years, with the right to reapply after the fact. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado Office of Insurance Regulation."
