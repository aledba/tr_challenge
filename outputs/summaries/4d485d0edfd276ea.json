  "summary": "On March 20, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a New York City man who, in 2012 and under medical supervision, had embryos created using his sperm and eggs from an anonymous egg donor and born to a gestational surrogate.  According to the court's order, the surrogate had no genetic connection to the child and was never intended to adopt the child.  The court also ruled that the surrogate's participation in a surrogacy contract did not qualify her as a parent, as required by the federal law, and that the court should not impose a civil penalty or a felony conviction against her.  In addition, the court found that, under New York state law, a parent can adopt a child from an unenforceable surrogate, without the payment of proscribed compensation, without any authority for a parent to adopt his or her own child, and without the right to a court-ordered custody proceeding.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Court's judgment, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $10,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil monetary penalty of $500. The judgment also prohibits the defendant from acting as an unregistered broker or representative of a company or a state that does not have jurisdiction to issue an order of filiation against him.  On March 21, 2019, the Court entered a judgment against the defendant, permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, imposing a $500,000 civil penalty, and ordering the defendant to pay a $75,000 penalty. The court granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the court to consider the merits of the case. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the New York Office of Advocacy and Advocacy. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Manhattan, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Justice in this matter.
