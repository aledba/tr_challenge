  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against Mitchell Gregory Peck, Jr., a Pennsylvania man who was convicted of drug possession resulting in death.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in York County, Pennsylvania on September 1, 2017, alleges that Peck, a resident of Fawn Grove, Pennsylvania, sold and sold heroin to a Maryland man who died in Pennsylvania.  According to the complaint, Appellant told the man that the heroin was \"off the brick, purest of pure\" and \"that was worse than any other drug delivery resulting in life.\"  The complaint further alleges that the defendant sold the heroin to the man and told him to \"try it.\"  As alleged, however, the delivery resulted in the death of the victim, including an unborn child, and the defendant was not criminally liable for the drug delivery.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Peck has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 20 to 40 years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Peck, charging him with violating Section 2506 of the Exchange Act, and with violating the pre-sentence investigation provisions of Sections 13(a)(1) and (30) and 13(b)(2)(A) of those charged with the same federal securities laws, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On September 6, 2016, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office filed an information complaint against Appelant for delivery of heroin and drug related drug related material in violation of the federal criminal laws.  As part of its investigation, the SEC obtained an asset freeze and other emergency relief, including a temporary restraining order, and an officer-and-director bar.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka of the Philadelphia Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Criminal Justice.  A hearing will be conducted by Gregory A. Kasper and Mark L. Sylvester in the Office of the Commodity Futures Futures Trading Commission, with the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221."
