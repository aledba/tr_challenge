  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against CalAtlantic Group, Inc., formerly known as Standard Pacific Corp., for violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ladera Ranch, California, alleges that, in 2014, the Honorable James Smith appointed a mediator and dispute resolution facilitator to arbitrate an arbitration case brought by a homeowners association against a developer for alleged construction defects.  According to the complaint, the arbitrator had committed clear legal error by ignoring a statutory mandate and failing to provide a sufficient number of members to call a special meeting to consider the merits of the claim.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Branches agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws and requires him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his or her civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Branches.  Branches also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 31, 2017, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and ordered a hearing on the matter.
