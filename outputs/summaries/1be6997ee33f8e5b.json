  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Metropolitan Group Property & Casualty Insurance Company, a New York-based company that insured a motor vehicle in Freeport, New York.  According to the court's order, on January 23, 2012, Pierre-Canel and his company, Metropolitan Group, filed a civil injunctive action against John Wellington, alleging that the vehicle was involved in a collision that resulted in the loss of at least $12,809.25 in insured property.  The court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the payment of a default judgment against Wellington.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Wellington, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their respective profits.  Finally, the court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antiligence provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and ordered the defendants to pay a $12.809 million civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Vincent C. Alexander, David D. Siegel, and Patrick J. McCluskey of the New York Office of the Attorney General, with assistance from John Rymas of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit, and is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.N. Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Nassau County Prosecutor's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 598 (January 24, 2012).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
