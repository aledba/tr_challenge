  "summary": "On August 28, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland entered a preliminary injunction against Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategic Consulting, Inc., a Maryland-based political consulting firm, for alleged trademark infringement and unfair competition.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that Mayson, a Florida-based registered representative, used the MASON-DIXON Mark in connection with its polling and consulting services.  According to the complaint, Mayson's use of the mark was so egregious that it was deemed to be in the public interest.  Mayson also allegedly used the mark as an unregistered service mark, despite having no right to use the mark in commerce or consulting services when Mayson began operating in 2015.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mayson.  To learn more about trademark infringement, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 12-2, (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  In its amended complaint, the court also ordered Mayson to pay $10,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of its profits.  On August 29, the SEC's Office of Patent and Trademark Regulation issued an\u00c2\u00a0Order\u00c2\u00a0requiring\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0the registration of a registered mark be renewed every five years.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's order also requires the registration of any mark that is not registered with the court as a result of an administrative proceeding.  For example, the complaint alleges that in 2016 Mayson filed an amended complaint with the SEC alleging that it had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that in 2017 Mayson abandoned the mark for political consulting services in violation of Section 15(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s amended complaint filed in the federal district court for Maryland, Mason and Mayson consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil monetary penalty of $20,000.  Mason also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to a five-year conduct-based injunction, which is subject to court approval.  Additionally, Mason agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and to be prohibited from associating with any third party"
