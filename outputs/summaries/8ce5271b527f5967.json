  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 3304 of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, alleges that the Department of Justice (DOJ) improperly imposed a three-year limitation on the amount of time that an agency can conduct an independent criminal investigation of a public safety officer.  According to the complaint, the DOJ's use of the same investigator to conduct a criminal investigation and tolling of the limitations period was inadmissible because the investigation was conducted by an independent agency rather than an independent one.  In addition, the complaint alleges that CDCR failed to disclose to the department's internal affairs staff that a third party had provided information about the alleged misconduct.  Finally, the SEC alleges that, in a parallel action, the District Attorney's Office of California (\"DOJ\") filed an administrative action against CDCR for violations of the anti-fraud provisions.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, CDCR consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of Sections 3303 and 3304, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of 5 percent for failure of good behavior and other grounds, including violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and requires CDCR to comply with the requirements of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder.  CDCR agreed to settle the case against it by consenting to an administrative order that imposes a five percent civil penalty against it.  Iqbal also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a federal agency for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in any criminal investigation.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Andrew Ruiz and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Ruiz. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Inspector General (OIG) in this matter, and the Office of Professional and Risk Analysis (OPA).  The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The Commission on Inspector General's Office has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor"
