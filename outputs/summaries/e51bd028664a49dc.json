  "summary": "On October 15, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Cornelius J. Mahoney, the owner and sole shareholder of a used car dealership in the Village of Canton, St. Lawrence County, New York.  According to the court's order, Mahoney was charged with offering a false instrument for filing in the first degree when, in 2001, he was unable to obtain the necessary odometer conversion statements for the vehicles on which he sold the warranty.  The court also found that, despite having paid claimant for a warranty on their automobile in February 2003 when they bought their vehicle from his dealership, as of July 2003 they still had no warranty and he had not offered to refund the money.  In addition, the court found that defendant was liable for malicious prosecution and false arrest with respect to the July and August 2003 charges.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Court of Claims' order, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $160,000.  On October 19, 2016, the Honorable Kathleen M. Broughton of the United States District Court in Manhattan granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against Mahoney. The SEC's investigation was conducted by James DiSalvo and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. DeLourdes Torres. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the FBI in this matter."
