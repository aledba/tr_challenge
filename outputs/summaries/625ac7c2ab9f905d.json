  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, ordering him to suspend the operator's license of an individual who refused to submit to a breath analysis test.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that, on April 24, 2014, State Trooper Troy M. Biggs of Bethany, Connecticut, observed a Mercedes-Benz driving erratically on Route 63 near Round Hill Road in Bethany. The complaint further alleges that shortly thereafter, a hearing officer observed the car swerving and crossing the center line. According to the complaint, Biggs immediately confronted the driver and asked her to exit the vehicle and to perform a field sobriety test. The hearing officer agreed to the suspension without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The SEC alleges that Biggs failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his suspension of the individual's license.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Connecticut today announced criminal charges against the individual.  On May 30, 2014 the SEC filed an emergency action against Biggs, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting the officer's violations of Section 14-227 of the Exchange Act. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, with assistance from John Rymas of the Division of Enforcement's Analysis and Detection Center. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Connecticut Office of Insurance Regulation."
