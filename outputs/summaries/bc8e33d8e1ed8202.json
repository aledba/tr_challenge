  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment against defendant David Roy Bakke, who was convicted of grand theft and ordered to pay $2,549.83 in restitution.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Idaho, alleges that Bakke violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Bakke agreed to a specific hourly rate of $149.99 per week and failed to return the vehicle on time.  Bakke also agreed to be required to pay a restitution amount equal to the amount of the alleged economic loss to the victim.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Bakke.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the court improperly granted Bakke a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay restitution at a later date.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $1,500. The final judgment orders Bakke to pay disgorgement of $3,655.83 plus interest of $192.95 and a $2.5 million civil penalty for a period of seventeen weeks.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Idaho Court of Appeals issued an order suspending the suspension of the suspension pending final judgment on the merits of the SEC case.    The court also issued a preliminary injunction against future violations of the securities laws. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
