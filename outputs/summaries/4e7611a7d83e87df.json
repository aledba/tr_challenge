  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of two counts of attempted indecent behavior with a juvenile, violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that defendant Scott Benton, of Pearl River, Louisiana, was an expert in forensic pediatric medicine. According to the complaint, Benton described frequent visits to her maternal grandparents' home in St. Tammany Parish, where she enjoyed fishing and hunting with her \"pawpaw.\" The complaint further alleges that defendants frequently took selfies in a tank top and shorts in the bathtub and shared the photos with her mother and sister. The complaint alleges that one day, defendant confronted her about the topless photos and told her that he had \"flashed\" her while she was in the shower, and promised that he would never do it again. After learning of the alleged misconduct, defendant allegedly continued doing so, despite being grounded and not allowed to use the computer at the time.  He also allegedly tried to embarrass her into discontinuing sexual relations with him.  In a second assignment of error, the SEC alleges that Benton raised the objection of hearsay and confrontation error for the first time on the first day of trial, when he learned of the allegations made by E.A. and W.A.'s testimony.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of three and a half years. The judgment also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company or association with any SEC-registered broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The SEC also prohibits defendants from associating with anyone with a history of sexual misconduct, including with a law enforcement agency, from using the internet, and from providing any assistance in the investigation of a criminal case.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Amy C. McKinley of the New Orleans District Court issued an order suspending Benton from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert witness. The order also requires him to provide a copy of the complaint to the SEC, which is subject to court approval. The court also ordered him to comply with the court's order barring him from appearing, practicing, or selling any security, including the ability to access the internet."
