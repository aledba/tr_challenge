  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Thomas Y. Pickett & Co., Inc. (\"Pickett\"), a Texas-based appraiser, for failing to timely file a motion to dismiss pursuant to the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Appellees' original petition, filed in federal district court in Houston, Texas, alleged that Pickett and the Appraisal Review Board improperly omitted the mineral interests of Appellants and other entities in Scurry County from the appraisal roll. The complaint also alleged that Appellant and Pickett failed to timely respond to the Commission's requests for a hearing on the matter. The Commission's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins Pickett from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future and orders him to pay disgorgement of $14.147 billion, prejudgment interest of $1.2 million, and a civil penalty of $100,000. The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Auld and Eric Werner of the Fort Worth Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
