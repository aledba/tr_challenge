  "summary": "On September 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington entered a final judgment against Alaska Logistics, LLC and Goldstream Engineering, Inc., a Seattle, Washington-based construction contractor, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Seattle, Alaska, Goldstream entered into an agreement in which it agreed to pay $213,391 to settle a complaint brought by Newtok Village Council, an Indian tribe located in Newtok, Alaska. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's Complaint alleges that the settlement is in the best interest of the tribe and its interests.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Newtok waived its sovereign immunity by consenting to arbitration and to the enforcement of arbitral awards in Oklahoma state court.   The complaint also alleges that Goldstream violated Rule 12(f) by failing to comply with certain requirements of the federal securities laws, including that a tribe may effect a limited waiver of sovereign immunity through its litigation activity.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Alaska and the tribe consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions, and require them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $231,391, which is equal to the amount that the tribe has already paid to settle the complaint.  Additionally, the settlement requires the tribe to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court that enjoins it from violating these provisions.  Finally, the court has agreed to a settlement where it will determine whether the tribe is entitled to a permanent injunction, a penny stock bar, and a bar against the tribe from participating in any type of barge transportation. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is pending final approval by the court, which will determine the settlement at a later date.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 17, 2018).  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Marc J. Ricchiute and Kurt L. Gottschall of the Commission's Office of Inspector General. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alaska Department of Fish and Wildlife, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Alaska, and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission in this matter."
