  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment in favor of the SEC's motion to suppress, on the basis of insufficient evidence, that a search conducted without a warrant constitutes an unreasonable search and seizure.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that on December 15, 2014, Victor Mobley was driving a 2014 Dodge Charger on Flippen Road in Henry County, Georgia when he collided with a Chevrolet Corvette at the scene of the collision. According to the complaint, Mobley had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the data retrieved from the car, and the car had been traveling at an excessive rate of speed at the time of the crash. The complaint alleges that Mobley sought a warrant to search the car and the Corvette, but was unable to obtain one because the car was being towed to an impound lot for further investigation. Mobley's complaint charges the SEC with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Georgia today announced criminal charges against Mobley arising from the same conduct. The SEC previously charged Mobley in a similar action.  On March 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in Atlanta issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct a parallel criminal investigation. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-5-30 (January 24, 2019)."
