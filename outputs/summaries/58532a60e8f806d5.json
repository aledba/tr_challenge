  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of a California-based home health care company in a civil action brought by Alzheimer's patients.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, Carolyn Gregory was trained to care for patients with Alzheimer's disease, and had done so in other jobs.  The complaint alleges that Gregory was not trained to deal with the risks posed by dementia patients, and that her duties included supervising, bathing, dressing, and transporting Lorraine, a nursing assistant who had been injured by an Alzheimer's patient.  Gregory also alleges that she was not aware of the risk of injury to her client.  As alleged in the complaint, Gregory's duties included supervision of Lorraine while she was washing dishes and assisting her with housekeeping duties.  In addition, Gregory alleges that when she was injured, she dropped the knife, which struck her wrist.   The SEC's final judgment, which permanently enjoins Gregory from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.
