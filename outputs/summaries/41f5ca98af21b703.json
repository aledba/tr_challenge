  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a Steubenville, Ohio woman who was charged with retaliating against a confidential informant who testified at a drug-trafficking trial.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, D.B. Edwards agreed to work with law enforcement as a confidential source to provide assistance in the investigation of two brothers who were suspected of running a drug ring. The complaint alleges that Edwards made numerous derogatory posts on social media about the brothers, including one in which she called them a \"snitch\" and a \u201crat.\u201d The complaint also alleges that she shared a doctored photo of one of the brothers on the witness stand and called him a \u2018snitch.\u2019 The complaint charges Edwards with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1513(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Edwards consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of three months, followed by three months in a halfway house, three months of home detention, and three years on supervised release. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Department of Justice in this matter."
