  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota today entered a final judgment in favor of Weisser and Schoenfelder Construction, Inc., a South Dakota-based construction company, in a settled civil action brought by Fluth.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Mitchell, South Dakota, on June 3, 2012, Weisser met with Brian Wendelboe, the Mitchell Water Distribution Department foreman, who told him that the waterline accessing the property needed to be shut off by a licensed plumber at either the street-curb valve or at the water main beneath the street. The complaint alleges that Weisser replied, \u201cLet\u2019s not worry about it right now.\u201d  The complaint further alleges that Schoenefelder agreed to settle without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  The court also denied Weisser's motion for summary judgment, which would have required him to pay a civil penalty of $7,500.  Weisser also agreed to be barred from liability for his role in the settlement.  In a parallel action, on January 3, 2017, the court granted Weisser a temporary restraining order and ordered the construction of a new home and a new car.  On January 6, 2017 Weisser filed a second complaint in the United States District Court against Fluth, charging her with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15-8-17 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Weiss and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Steven D. Kelley. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission in this matter."
