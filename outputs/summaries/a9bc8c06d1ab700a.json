  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against a former prisoner who filed a civil injunctive action in federal court against the Department of Corrections for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that, in violation of a federal prison disciplinary rule, Calvin Johnson, a former state prisoner, was deprived of his right to due-process rights in connection with his release from prison.  According to the complaint, Johnson was transferred to a different prison job in response to the withholding of $3.82 from his inmate pay, resulting in a wage reduction of ten cents per month.  As alleged, Johnson also had no other source of income and was not entitled to the exemption from withholding.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in responding to his step-two grievance, Ms. Whitney withheld the additional $1.41 from his account, making him ineligible for the exemption.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Johnson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and requires him to provide a copy of the SEC\u2019s complaint to the court.  Finally, the court granted the request for a temporary restraining order against Mr. Johnson and ordered him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,038, which he received as a result of his release.  On November 1, 2016, a federal district judge in Denver granted the SEC request for an asset freeze against Johnson, and granted the court the right to order him to comply with the court order.  A hearing on December 2, 2017, was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  To learn more about asset freeze relief, see Litigation Release Release Release No. 547 (10th Cir. 2010).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Kurt L. Gottschall of the Denver Regional Office.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office, with assistance from John R. Rymas of the Division of Criminal Justice and the Office of Inspector General's Criminal Investigations."
