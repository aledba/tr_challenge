  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Orlena R. Drath, a convicted felon who was sentenced to serve a total of 128 months in prison.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, charges Drath with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Drath and her then-boyfriend, Scott Herigstad, repeatedly broke into their neighbor's home and stole approximately 75 firearms and an unspecified number of knives and swords. The complaint alleges that Drath refused to participate in the plea negotiations because she knew that the State could file additional charges at any time.  Drath also allegedly failed to disclose to her counsel that certain items were taken from Maffei's home during the burglaries.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Drath arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of up to $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a separate case, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in which it obtained a temporary restraining order halting the sale of securities in the securities industry and ordering the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the securities laws. The SEC also obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of certain of Drath's family members, including her mother, father, brother, and sister-in-law.  Among other things, the court granted the SEC request for an asset freeze and an accounting of the assets held in the escrowed assets of the defendants.   The court's order also prohibits the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter or an order appointing a receiver for the receivership of the stolen securities, and orders the receiver to provide a copy of the receiver's letter to the receiver."
