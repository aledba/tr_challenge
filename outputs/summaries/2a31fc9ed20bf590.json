  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two truck drivers for failure to bring their cases to trial within the five-year period provided by the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles on May 19, 2013, Henry Castillo, a truck driver employed jointly by KWK and DHL Express, alleged that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1775 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC alleges that Castillo failed to show it was impossible, impracticable or futile to bring his case to trial in a court-annexed mediation program.  In addition, Castillo alleges that he did not show that the court had the authority to order the parties to participate in private mediation when, as a matter of law, it did not.  Castillo also alleges that, in a parallel action, the defendants failed to disclose to the court that they had not yet made an adequate showing regarding the class representatives.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, impose civil penalties, and impose officer-and-director and penny stock bars.  Additionally, the court granted Castillo's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to submit new class certification motions by March 19, 2011, more than two years after the filing of the original complaint.   The court also ordered Castillo to submit a second amended complaint, which also included a provision requiring that the parties submit their case to mediation within six months of the issuance of the final judgments, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $50,000, and requiring him to file a motion for an injunction against further violations of the federal anti-fraud provisions.  As a result of the court's order, the parties agreed to settle the matter by agreeing to pay $75,000 in pre-judgment interest and a $25,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000.  This settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the California Office of the Attorney General."
