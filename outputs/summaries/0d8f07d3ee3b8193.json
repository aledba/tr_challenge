  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the United States Postal Inspection Service (USPIE) in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that American Airlines, Inc., a now-defunct subsidiary of USPIE, violated the duty of fair representation under the federal securities laws by entering into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with a union that was not a party to the union's breach of duty.  According to the complaint, the MOU required the union to bargain exclusively for all employees in a particular bargaining unit, and that the employer had a duty to represent its own interests, not those of the employees.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the union failed to show that it had a legitimate right to fair representation when it entered into a MOU with the union.  As a result, the defendants were unable to obtain a court order requiring the employer to comply with the terms of its MOU, including the right to participate in collective bargaining, and the obligation to pay a penalty equal to the amount of the employer's disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, American Airlines agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal law, and orders it to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million, $1 million, and $100,000, respectively, to settle the charges against it. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.  On May 24, 2019, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of California entered a judgment against the defendants, finding that the defendants violated the duties and duties of the union, and ordering the defendants to pay $1,500, $500, and a civil money penalty of $150,000.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order, barring the defendants from participating in any collective bargaining agreement, and imposing a civil monetary penalty against each of them. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Foust and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Timothy J. Karpel and Mr. Fischer. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, and other relevant authorities."
