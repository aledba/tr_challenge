  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Peter and Lisa Free, who are alleged to have violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, in February 2003, shortly after Madeline Castellotti died, Lisa and Peter entered into an oral agreement whereby Lisa agreed to give Peter half of the assets, expecting that he would later receive his share of the estate taxes.  Instead, the complaint alleges that Lisa allegedly procured, at Peter's expense, a $5 million insurance policy naming Peter as sole beneficiary.  According to the complaint, however, this provision was barred by the federal securities laws, and Peter was not entitled to the right to an accounting based on his alleged substantial payment of estate taxes, despite having allegedly paid $2 million in estate taxes in the past.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Peter failed to disclose to Lisa that he had signed the oral agreement for the purpose of delaying the receipt of the allegedly ill-gotten gains, including a successful New York restaurant business, and that he failed to pay the company's sales and payroll taxes, filing a false insurance application, and operating John's Pizzeria in violation of numerous administrative regulations.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Peter has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  Peter has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On August 2, 2014, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans of the New York District Court entered a temporary restraining order against Peter, freezing his assets, and barring him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any real estate in connection with the alleged violations of the anti-fraud provisions.  A hearing on August 4, 2014 was scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Eastern.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael Ehrlich and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC examination was conducted in the Office of Compliance and Assessments and Examinations. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
