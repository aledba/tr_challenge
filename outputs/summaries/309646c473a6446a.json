  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered final judgments against two part-time teachers for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, N.J., alleges that Beryl Zimmerman and Judy Comment, both part-timers for the Sussex County Educational Services Commission (SCESC), violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Tenure Act by failing to include a guaranteed minimum number of work hours in the contract documents. According to the complaint, the SCESC reduced the number of hours that petitioners could work based on their seniority status and actual reduction in annual income. The complaint further alleges that the omission of that information from the contracts did not deprive petitioners of their tenure and seniority rights. In addition, the complaint alleges that Zimmerman and Comment violated Section 10(b)(5) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the federal securities laws. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Education today announced that it has issued an order suspending the issuance of an Order suspending the suspension of the Order. The order also temporarily enjoins the SEC from issuing an order imposing a conduct-based injunction, imposing an officer-and-director bar, and ordering the SEC to conduct an internal examination of its books and records to determine whether there are any violations of the anti-fraud provisions. The court's order also orders the SEC and the Department of Education to jointly and severally supervise the SEC's litigation.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action in the United States District Court in Newark against Beryl Z. Zimmerman, Judy W. Comment, and Beryl W. Zimmerman of the New Jersey School Boards Association (SBA) for violations of Section 10 of the Exchange Act. The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the Division of Education's New Jersey Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Z. Comment and Ms. Spiewak.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission (FTC)."
