  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment in favor of Ohio-based Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, which is seeking a temporary restraining order and other emergency relief.  According to the court's order, on March 9, 2020, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine issued an emergency order to halt a planned surgical abortion in Ohio.  The order, which was issued in response to a complaint filed by the Ohio Department of Health (DOH) in March 2020, requires that all healthcare providers provide pre-viability abortions, including surgical abortions. The order also requires that physicians perform a surgical abortion before viability, and that any delay in performing the procedure is deemed necessary to preserve a woman's right to abortion. The court also ordered that all Ohio clinics comply with the DOH's order.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Secretary of Health and Human Services today announced that it has issued a preliminary injunction against future violations of the DoH's Order. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dayton, Ohio, alleges that Ohio physicians violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On March 21, 2020 the Ohio Court of Appeals issued a final order imposing a temporary injunction against Ohio doctors from violating the DoDH's orders. The Court granted the request for a temporary injunctive relief, ordered an emergency court order, and issued an order suspending the practice of practicing medicine in Ohio until the DOHC's order is implemented.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Ohio doctors have consented to the entry of orders suspending or suspending their practicing practice and from participating in the provision of any medical procedure in the state. In addition, the court has ordered Ohio doctors to comply with a DoDHA order that requires them to perform pre-vigorous, pre-term, and post-abortion procedures. The orders also require that Ohio doctors provide timely, accurate, and cost-effective advice to prevent future COVID-19 infections.  Additionally, the Court ordered Ohio physicians to submit written responses to questions posed to them in the Commission's Order, including: (1) whether they are qualified to perform a pre-abortion procedure, (2) whether their practice is safe, and (3) whether there is sufficient evidence to support a reasonable determination of whether a procedure is essential. (4) If there is, there is a significant risk to the patient's life and to the health and safety of others. (5) The Court also ordered Ohio medical professionals to cooperate with the investigation"
