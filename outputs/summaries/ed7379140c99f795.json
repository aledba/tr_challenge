  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against BNSF Railway Company, Inc. (\"BNSF\"), a New Mexico-based freight train company, and its former owner, Jeremy LaJeunesse, for their roles in the alleged misconduct.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on March 6, 2018, LaJeunese, who was employed as a Motorized Track Inspector at BNS F.C. (\"M&T\"), told B&T that he had been practicing weight lifting since December 2017 when he injured his back in California.  He allegedly performed multiple sets of weighted back squats on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, which he claimed he could lift up to 200 pounds.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to representations made in the complaint, he did not have any prior experience with weight lifting and instead simply did not use the tools and equipment required to perform his duties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New Mexico today announced criminal charges against La Jeunesse.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&T&D&C&A&rdquo;s Complaint, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.   The court also granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from using the internet, from making material misrepresentations to the court, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Denver Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Mexico Department of Insurance, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, the Arizona Department of Banking and Securities, the United States Postal Inspection Service and the Arizona Office of Inspector General."
