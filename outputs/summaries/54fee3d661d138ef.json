  "summary": "On July 24, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in favor of retaining certain of the agency\u2019s pre-2014 and 2015 orders.  The court found that the agency failed to adequately balance the responsibilities and obligations of certain of its landline-only providers and failed to consider whether incumbent ETCs were in a unique position to provide high-quality, high-cost, and extremely high-speed internet services.  In its final judgment, the court held that the FCC violated Section 254(b)(5) of the Communications Act of 1934 and ordered the agency to retain certain of those obligations in place for an interim period.  According to the court order, the agency did not consider the need for additional funding, but rather that it should consider whether it was reasonable to retain those obligations.  For example, the Court found that, in 2014 and 2015, certain of these obligations were in place when the agency issued its 2014 Order, which required that all ETC providers be eligible to receive federal funding.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a final order that permanently restrains those obligations and provides for a temporary period of time to determine how to proceed with the implementation of the proposed rule.  On July 4, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in New York City, alleging that the Commission violated Section 5 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Rules of Order by failing to adequately consider the relevant factors and data presented in the Commission&rsquo;s order.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that, under Section 5, the FCC failed to account for the impact of the 2014 Order on the incumbent providers when it issued its 2015 Order, and that, as a result of that action, it has not acted as a reasonable broker-dealer to determine whether to restrout those obligations or to provide additional financial support.   The SEC also charged AT&T and CenturyLink with violating Section 5(b) and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The court also issued an order requiring the Commission to consider the specific nature of the alleged violations of Section 5. The order also requires the FCC to consider how to deal with the other provisions of the federal law, including whether it is reasonable to withhold funding from certain service providers.  Finally, the order requires the Commission"
