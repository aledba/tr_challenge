  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found unfit to provide for the return of a child.  According to the court's order, on March 22, 2016, a Rockdale, Illinois man was placed in the custody and guardianship of his daughter, Z.M., because he failed to make reasonable progress toward her return.  The court also found that the defendant had failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern, and responsibility as to the child's welfare and that he was in the best interest of the child and his family.  In its order, the court found that respondent had violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered that he be placed in temporary custody of DCFS, granted visitation at the discretion of the court, and required to provide proof of employment and a new lease or rent receipt.  On April 26, 2017, the trial court entered an order finding that respondent was unfit for the purpose of terminating his parental rights, ordering him to return home, and requiring him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, respondent consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the provisions of the federal securities laws, and provides that the court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the SEC.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, charges the defendant with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15 of the Exchange Act and Rule 15b2-3 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-director and penny stock bars against the defendant. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendant to pay $2,500 civil penalties. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois State Department of Health and Human Services."
