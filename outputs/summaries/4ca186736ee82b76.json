  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming today entered a final judgment against a Wyoming man who was convicted of attempted battery in connection with a high-speed chase through Wyoming.  According to the SEC's complaint, Cortney Alan Kite, a resident of Converse County, Wyoming, was driving north on I-25 when he observed a silver Pontiac Grand Prix with Iowa plates pass a semi-truck without signaling and drift over the fog line close to the median.  The complaint alleges that while driving against the semi, Mr. Kite twice changed lanes, first from the passing lane to the driving lane and then back.  As alleged in the complaint, Kite then moved into the driver\u2019s seat and continued driving, causing the semi to stop and obstruct the other vehicles.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of Wyo. today announced criminal charges against Kite.   The SEC also announced related criminal charges.  On May 19, 2017, the court entered a judgment of acquittal on the aggravated assault and battery charge, finding Kite guilty of felony battery under the federal antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering Kite to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requiring him to pay civil penalties of $20,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the federal district court in Jackson, Wyo., Kite consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  Kite also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, with the right to reapply after a five-year period, to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Eric K. Leavitt of the Denver Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wyoming State Attorney General's Office, and the Wyoming Department of Criminal Justice."
