  "summary": "On March 7, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a temporary restraining order against Ohio Department of Rehabilitation & Correction (DRC) Director Gary Mohr from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that DRC failed to comply with its statutory duty to provide access to all of the requested records in response to Hogan Lovells's request.  According to the complaint, DRC did not respond to the request until December 29, 2016.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against DRC for its failure to respond to a public records request in March 2016. The SEC alleges that in its complaint to the court on March 8, 2017, the date DRC responded to the public-records request, that it provided all records in its possession as of the date of the request, and that it followed up with DRC twice in August, after having heard nothing since DRC's initial acknowledgement in March.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the complaint charges DRC with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) and (a)(4) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  DRC has also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On May 31, 2018, the court issued an order requiring DRC to provide the requested documents to the SEC as part of an ongoing investigation.  A hearing on June 20, 2017 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. for the SEC to consider the merits of the case.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1771 (January 13, 2016).  The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
