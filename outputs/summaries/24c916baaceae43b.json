  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment against the Division of Child Protection and Permanency for failing to satisfy its statutory \"best interests of the child\" test.  The court also found that the Division failed to satisfy the statutory \u201cbest interests\u201d test when it terminated Max and Sally's parental rights to Scott and Cara.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Newark, New Jersey, on April 8, 2013, the Division found that Scott, Cara, and Carol, then two and one years old, were not fit to parent and were not capable of providing for their children.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Max failed to participate in a bonding evaluation and clinical interview while in the custody of the Division, despite repeated requests from the Division to do so.  As alleged in the complaint, Scott's father, Scott, had been incarcerated since October 2016 and had been removed from the family home in October 2016.  Scott's mother, Carol, was incarcerated in Florida for receiving stolen property from her husband.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and the Division's decision to terminate the parental rights, the court granted the Division guardianship of the children and issued a temporary restraining order against Max and his family from further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  On May 9, 2018, a federal district judge in New Jersey granted the court's order against sending the children to be placed in foster care as part of a three-pronged action to determine whether the children should be removed from their parent-child relationship.  To learn more about foster care and how to spot signs of abuse and neglect, see the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services' website."
