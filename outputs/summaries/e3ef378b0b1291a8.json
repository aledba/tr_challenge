  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans today entered a final judgment against Gray Insurance Company and Ronald Callais, a former college football coach, for defrauding a jury at trial.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on April 22, 2012, Mr. Lavigne was involved in a motor vehicle accident in which he was injured.  According to the complaint, the jury deliberated for nearly two hours before finding that the jury should not have been able to determine whether to award a penalty based on the jury's findings.  In its judgment, the court found that, contrary to the SEC's finding, that defendants were entitled to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Gray Insurance and Callais consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering the jury to determine the amount of monetary penalties to be imposed upon each defendant, and requiring the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Gray Insurance agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $150,000 for each defendant.  Callais agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future misconduct, and Gray Insurance will pay a penalty of a total of $2,500.  Appellants also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 24, 2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related case, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action on April 19, 2013, charging Gray Insurance with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)"
