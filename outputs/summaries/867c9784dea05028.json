  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted sex offender for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that, in January 2013, defendant, then-20-year-old, met with a probation officer in the family home where he had resided with his parents and where the sex offender had been convicted. The court found that, while on probation, defendant was prohibited from accessing the internet without the prior written approval of his probation officer, and that he had to submit to regular searches of his computer and home to determine whether he had used the internet as an instrument of harm. In addition, the court ruled that a total ban on access to social media, including on the internet, was unreasonable and unreasonable.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on July 4, 2018, the Court found that defendant violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rules 5b-5(b) and (c) thereunder. The Court also found that the provision of the Exchange Act, Section 5(b)(5) and Rule 5b2-1 thereunder, is unreasonable and, in the alternative, requires the probation officer to \"lift or modify\" the condition of the exchange of information.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 10 years and a $10,000,000 civil penalty. The judgment also prohibits him from associating with anyone under 18 years of age and from using any third-party services, including the internet. The order also imposes a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendant from using the internet for any purpose other than to check the background of a person who has been convicted of a sex offense. The final judgment, which is pending final approval by the court, orders the defendant to comply with the court's order, including, without limitation, with the right to reapply after five years of imprisonment. The judge granted the request for a permanent injunction against future violations of the First Amendment, and the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the U."
