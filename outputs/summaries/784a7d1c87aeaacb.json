  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Irvine County, California, on consent for the imposition of a temporary restraining order and other emergency relief.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Irvine County filed an emergency action in January 2013 to halt construction of the Musick Correctional Facility in Irvine, California.  The complaint alleges that Irvine County violated the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 15b-5 thereunder, and that the County of Irvine failed to adequately respond to Irvine County's requests for an EIR.  In its response, the court found that Irvine did not adequately adequately disclose the impact of the project on the county's own land holdings, the amount of agricultural land that was lost, and the timing of the EIR's approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Irvine and the county consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Section 15a of the Exchange Act, ordering Irvine to comply with the Commission's order, and ordering the county to submit a final EIR for the project by the end of the year.  Irvine also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, which is equal to the amount that Irvine will pay in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000, and to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws.   The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Gregory A.
