  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a Texas man charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that David Pena, a resident of San Antonio, Tex., made a false statement to a Texas officer about a warrant for Pena's arrest for theft by check. According to the complaint, Pena admitted to the officer that he had obtained the warrant for his arrest and that he initiated a search of the trunk of his car for the purpose of obtaining a search warrant. The complaint further alleges that Pena agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. Pena also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States. The court also ordered Pena to pay disgorgement of $3,500, prejudgment interest of $100,000, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Pena. The SEC is continuing its investigation into the matter. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice."
