  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment in favor of Schroeder's motion for summary judgment against Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, and others in a related foreclosure action.  The SEC's complaint, filed on July 1, 2019, alleges that Schroeder and her co-defendants, Kerry Feld, Ryan Forrest, and William Blake, are attempting to collect a debt from Schroeder as the alleged Trustee for a non-judicial foreclosure sale without proper notice or authority and thereby deprive her of the Property.  According to the complaint, Schroeder filed a complaint on May 8, 2015, alleging that in Case No. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, the court improperly appointed Kozeny & McCubbin, L.C., as nominee for Quicken and Merrill Lynch as trustee for the Property pursuant to the Deed of Trust.  Schroeder also alleges that in the prior state-court action, Bank of American improperly attempted to acquire the Note and Deed and improperly failed to prove existence of the Original Note and that it failed to provide a \"fabricated\" document\" evidencing the debt owed by Schroeder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the Nebraska Court of Appeals today granted Schroeder a temporary restraining order and ordered her to return her allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  On July 24, 2018, the Court granted the motion to dismiss and ordered Schroeder to return the allegedly illusory property to the court.   The court also granted the request for a preliminary injunction against the defendants, and ordered the court to consider the merits of the case. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Nebraska Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Nebraska Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
