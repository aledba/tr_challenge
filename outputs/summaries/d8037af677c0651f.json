  "summary": "On February 18, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Gary Graves, a New York City licensed clinical social worker, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, from approximately 1987 until his release on parole on August 29, 1992, Gary Graves was a Police Communications Technician with the New York Police Department.  As alleged in the complaint, in December 2001, he applied for a security \"license\" to work as a \"special officer\" at Rikers Island Correctional Facility, but was denied the right to work there because he had been previously convicted of one or more criminal charges.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal in July 2015, the SEC obtained a court order that permanently enjoins Graves from violating the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $75,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Graves arising from the same conduct that led to the revocation of his security clearance.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Graves consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay a civil penalty, and pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  Additionally, Graves agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years, and to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product, service, or benefit that is subject to the requirements of Section 7 of the Exchange Act, and requiring him to provide a copy of the SEC Complaint to the court.  On May 29, 2017, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Graves and ordered him to surrender his passport.  Following the court's order, Graves has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently barred from the securities industry and will be required to pay civil penalties in the amount of $750,000.  He also agreed to the appointment of a receiver under the supervision of the Department of Education, Department of Buildings, and Department of Health and Human Services, which will determine whether to issue a security clearance to certain individuals.  Among other things, the settlement is pending final approval by the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
