  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York today entered a final judgment against a jury that found Janine Plaza Pierce guilty of a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute four types of narcotics.  The court also issued an order suspending the jury from participating in jury deliberations.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, on August 1, 2016, Judge Frank P. Geraci issued a judgment against Pierce, finding her guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the jury to determine whether or not to discharge Pierce based on the jury\u2019s finding that she was guilty of the four drug-related charges.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against Pierce.  On August 2, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Pierce and her co-defendants, charging her with violating Section 846 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Pierce consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Judge Geraci also issued a temporary restraining order, barring Pierce from appearing before the SEC as an attorney or practicing before the court as a judge, ordering him to comply with the court order. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by J. David Fraser and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the New York Regional Office.
