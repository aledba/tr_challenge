  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against J.R. Roldan, a minor who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on May 31, 2018, Officer Kevin O'Brien and his partner, Officer Dan Doherty, conducted surveillance in an unmarked police vehicle on the 2500 block of North Neva Avenue in Chicago.  According to the complaint, the officers had received confidential information from a confidential informant that a red Nissan Maxima was being stopped by the Chicago Police Department and that the car was being followed by a person who was eight months pregnant. The complaint further alleges that the confidential informant made a false and misleading statement to the officers in the recording, and that, when confronted by the officer, the officer admitted that he had not been issued a valid FOID card.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On June 1, 2018 the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, prejudgment interest of $2,038.81, and a civil penalty of $10,000. The court also granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and orders the defendant to provide a copy of the SEC's Complaint, which is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint filed in the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains, and ordering the officer to pay civil penalties of $20,000 each. The judgment also orders the court to appoint a receiver for the receiver of the receiver and to issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver. The receiver will determine the amount of restitution to be paid by the receiver at a later date. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
