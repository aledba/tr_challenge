  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Nevada today entered a final judgment against Nevada Secretary of State Barbara C. Cegavske and her husband, Gary Hamilton, in an emergency action to halt the implementation of the all-mail election.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Las Vegas, Nevada, alleges that, under the direction of the Secretary, she issued an emergency order halting mail-in voting in advance of the June 9, 2020 Nevada primary.  According to the SEC's order, the Secretary issued the emergency order on March 24, 2020, ordering the Secretary to implement a new, more stringent, and expedited all-electoral rule that would prevent fraud in the state's elections.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the secretary consented to the court's order.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  To learn more about mail-out voting, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, and No. 17 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, and 14a-11 thereunder.
