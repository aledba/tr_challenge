  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a husband and wife who filed for divorce in 2011.  The court granted the husband's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay a $1,100,000 civil penalty.  According to the court's order, filed on February 14, 2011, wife entered into a separation agreement with her husband, David Allen Runge, without admitting or denying the allegations in her motion.  As alleged in the court order, the husband failed to disclose certain business entities and interests that he did not disclose or misrepresented in the separation agreement.  In addition, the court found that the husband had failed to provide a sufficient basis for his motion to dismiss, and therefore did not have jurisdiction to determine the value of the wife's assets.  Instead, as set forth in the order, husband entered into the agreement without providing any basis for the allocation of assets or discovery under the rule.  He also allegedly failed to show sufficient cause to justify his entry of the judgment, which required him to show cause to withdraw his motion for divorce from his wife.    The judgment also requires the court to determine whether further proceedings should be required in determining the adequacy of wife's financial disclosures.  For example, the order requires that the court determine whether there are sufficient grounds to allocate assets under C.R.C.P. 16.2(e)(10) when granting a divorce motion, and that there is sufficient evidence to show that there are reasonable grounds for a reasonable determination of the amount of assets and liabilities that a divorcee should have disclosed at the time she filed her divorce.  Without admitting to these facts, the judge agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to impose a civil penalty of $500,000, which is equal to the penalty imposed by the court upon the spouse.  Additionally, the judgment requires the husband to provide proof that he has made a reasonable and reasonable determination in the case of his divorce, including that he had not disclosed or omitted any material misstatements or omissions in the divorce proceedings.  It also requires that he provide proof of his wife's and her husband's ownership of the property, which he claimed was worth nearly $5 million.  Finally, it requires the wife to provide evidence that she has not made a sufficient showing under the Warne provision of the federal securities laws. \u00c2\u00a0The court also ordered the husband"
