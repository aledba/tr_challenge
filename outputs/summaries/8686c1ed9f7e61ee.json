  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against FirstEnergy, Ohio Edison Company, Ohio Electric Illuminating Company, and Toledo Edison Company in an emergency action to halt FirstEnergy's purchase of RECs.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that FirstEnergy violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  FirstEnergy has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to a permanent injunction and to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of the company's disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced that it has obtained a temporary restraining order and an order suspending FirstEnergy from issuing or selling any RECs in the future.  According to the complaint, FirstEnergy failed to disclose to ratepayers that it had consistently sought confidential treatment of the RECs, such as the quantity and price of its REC bids and whether specific bids were accepted by FirstEnergy.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the company agreed to pay $43,362,796.50 in civil injunctive relief, a penny stock bar, and an officer-and-director bar.  Second settlement is pending final approval by the court.  Third settlement is subject to court approval.  On January 10, 2014, the court granted a preliminary injunction and ordered FirstEnergy to comply with the court's order.  Last week, the SEC filed a second emergency action, seeking a court-ordered injunction and an injunction, and FirstEnergy consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay civil penalties of $43 million and a $1 million civil penalty of $100,000.   The court also issued an order halting FirstEnergy&rsquo;s receipt of a $50,000 civil penalty.  This order also prohibits FirstEnergy and its affiliated companies from issuing RECs and from selling or issuing any REC-related materials.  Further, the order prohibits the Commission from issuing a trade-secret order without first consulting FirstEnergy or any of its associated suppliers, and from issuing an order requiring the Commission to provide a copy of the final judgment to FirstEnergy pursuant to Rule 17a-1.  Finally, the Commission has agreed not to issue an order imposing a penalty on FirstEnergy that is not fully satisfied by the facts of the case. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Ohio Office of Inspector General."
