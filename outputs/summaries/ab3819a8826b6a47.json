  "summary": "On February 14, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut entered a final judgment against Maritimo Offshore Pty Ltd., a company owned by Richard and Sheila Dubois, and Edwin Fairbanks Yacht Group LLC, a company jointly owned by Flors and his adult son Michael Flors.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Connecticut, Flors, who was a co-owner of the boat, and Fairbanks agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  The court also ordered Flors to pay $3,207.10 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his attorney's fees.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Flors in connection with the same conduct alleged by the Fairbanks defendants.  Flors also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the sale of a boat.  As alleged in the SEC's complaint, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(A) and 5(b)(5)(B) of Securities Act of 1933.  Among other things, the court found that Flors has no standing to maintain a claim for breach of contract under the federal securities laws, and that he has a duty to protect the interests of the public companies he owns and controls.    The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Mr. Dolan."
