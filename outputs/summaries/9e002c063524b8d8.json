  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, LLC, a Kentucky-based insurance company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Nationwide violated the federal securities laws by filing a false and misleading insurance policy application.  According to the complaint, the Hattons made material misrepresentations when applying for insurance coverage under the policy, which entitles Nationwide to pay for the insurance policy.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, on the date of the application, Nationwide sent a letter to counsel informing him that it did not owe coverage to Nationwide.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Nationwide consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Nationwide has also agreed to settle the litigation by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d).  The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1158 (Aug. 10, 2018).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Nationwide. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office, and the Kentucky Attorney General's Office in this matter."
