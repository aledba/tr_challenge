  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of five counts of child molesting, as Level 1 felonies, following a jury trial.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Nathaniel Hale violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The complaint further alleges that Hale violated Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 16(b)(2)(A)(2) thereunder, and that the jury found Hale liable for each of the five counts.  Hale agreed to the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and agreed to a total of sixty-six years in prison and a five-year officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Hale arising from the same conduct.  According to the SEC's Complaint, Hale, who was previously incarcerated for a prior felony, engaged in a pattern of misconduct in which he engaged in the conduct of at least five separate occasions.  He also engaged in at least one other conduct that was deemed \"off-the-cuff\" by the trial court, which found him liable for five Level 1 felony convictions.  As part of the settlement, Hale will be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and will be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the company of a registered broker or investment adviser.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Feb. 20, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Department for New Jersey, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
