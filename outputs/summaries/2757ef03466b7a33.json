  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Texas State Trooper A.J. Huayamave, who was previously convicted of driving while intoxicated.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order and entered an order freezing the assets of the defendant.  According to the court's order, Huayameave violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Texas Criminal Code, Section 541.401(5) and 547.302(a)(1) of the federal securities laws, and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  In its order, the court also ordered the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-officer bar against him.  On September 5, 2016, the Texas Department of Public Safety conducted a routine traffic stop on Interstate 10 in Harris County, Texas. The trooper stopped appellant on the spot, but did not turn on her headlights. The court found that the trooper had reasonable suspicion that he was stopping an individual for a traffic violation.  As alleged in the court order, however, the trooper did not have reasonable suspicion to stop the individual.  Instead, the judge ruled that the officer violated the anti-fraud provision of the state's securities laws and that he had the burden of proving reasonable suspicion for the stop.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the law, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his or her civil penalty. The judge also granted the defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Bynum and supervised by Jennifer Chun Barry of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Chun and Ms. Barry. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The examination that led to the discovery of the evidence was conducted in the office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Division of Criminal Justice's Office of Inspector General. The investigation was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The trial was conducted under the supervision of Assistant Chief of the Criminal Division. The matter is being handled by Mr. Chun, Ms. Brunson, and the case has been supervised by Senior Trial Counsel Robert C. Hannan. The hearing is being led by Jennifer C. Barry and Mr. Hanauer."
