  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against Christopher Hardin, American Surface Solutions Group, L.L.C., Network Solutions, LLC, and its owner, Justin Morales, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that Hardin and American Surface violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") by establishing a business similar in nature and name to that of American Surface, and allowing Hardin to utilize North America's business, SteepleJacks, as his business operations.  According to the complaint, on February 8, 2017, the trial court granted a second assignment of error against North America, finding that the motion for a continuance was not in compliance with the court's orders and that it was unreasonable not to grant the continuance.  In its judgment, the court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of $72,066.61 plus prejudgment interest of $2,276.61 and a civil penalty of $20,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, and imposes civil penalties against each of them.  On March 9, 2018, a federal district court in Ohio issued a blanket order against American Surface and ordered it to cease and desist from violations of Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the company to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order against Hardin on February 28, 2018 and ordered him to withdraw from the case pending final judgment on the merits of the case. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Kormanik and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Department of Justice, and the Ohio Office of Inspector General in this matter."
