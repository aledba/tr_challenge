  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Victor Wayne Loyd, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to two years of hard labor, to be followed by a three-year prison sentence.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, alleges that, in September 2017, Loyd made a verbal agreement with Carol Spotsville, a relative of his, to repair a dented area on her 2006 Hyundai Santa Fe. She agreed to have Defendant do the repair work chiefly because he was charging her a low price. The complaint further alleges that he drove the car into Alexandria and collided with another vehicle. The SEC alleges that the defendant did not have permission to use the vehicle, and that he did not immediately return the car.  According to the complaint, after the fact, the defendant called his wife and told her he would have the job done by noon the next day.  In a parallel action, on September 13, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Loyd to pay a civil penalty of two years and a $1,000,000 civil penalty.  On August 16, 2018 the court found Loyd guilty as charged and ordered him to be sentenced to 2 years at hard labor and ordered to pay an $8,500,000 fine.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of seven hundred and fifty dollars, and to pay civil penalties of one thousand dollars and one hundred and twenty-five dollars, respectively.  Loyd also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to a five-year officer-and-director bar. The court also granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  For further information, see SEC v. Varnado, 01-367, p. 4 (La.App. 5th Cir. 1/27/98), 707 So.2d (L.A. 1981).  The Court also issued an order suspending Loyd from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  A hearing on August 13, 2019, was scheduled for 7:30 a.m."
