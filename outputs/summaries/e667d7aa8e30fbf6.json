The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Shiga entered a bible study team meeting at the church on April 6, 2011, and questioned the congregation members about the Catholic Church and the biblical basis for the pope\u2019s authority.  According to the complaint, Shiga asked his former grade school teacher about a statue on the church grounds depicting Christ on the cross.  Shiga allegedly told the teacher that the church had a lot of money and had done bad things to him.  He also allegedly told his teacher that he would \"willfully and maliciously set fire to or causes to be burned \"any structure, forest land, or property.\"  The complaint alleges Shiga then lit a tiki torch, which he used to set a fire in the church rectory, causing multiple structures to burn, and causing property damage exceeding $3.2 million.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the court agreed to the final judgment that permanently enjoins Shiga from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.

Sansone of the New York District Court entered a temporary restraining order against him from further violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to surrender his passport, pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.

Gordon Loomis, Jr., a convicted felon, for aiding and abetting Shiga's violations of Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rules 10b2-1 and Rule 15a-3 thereunder.
