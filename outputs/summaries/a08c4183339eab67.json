  "summary": "On June 29, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment in favor of William R. Runions, Jr., an Ohio resident who was convicted of three felonies, including breaking and entering (1981), receiving stolen property (1981) and uttering a forged check (1984).  According to the court's order, Runions was not eligible for a concealed carry license because of his felony convictions.  The court also ruled that, based upon Runions's prior felony convictions, he could not apply for a CCL without being relieved from the disability.  In addition, the court ruled that a pardon does not relieve Runions of the disability imposed by his conviction for a felony, and that an unconditional pardon is inapplicable to a person who has been relieved from a disability by operation of law.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Runions to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his criminal conviction.  Runions also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school unless he is relieved of a felony conviction pursuant to Section 2923.13 of the Revised Code.  On August 9, 2016, the Ohio Attorney General's Office filed an emergency action against Runions in which it obtained a temporary restraining order against him from future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17 (a)(1) and (3) and the Ohio Department of Health and Human Services (DOHHS) issued an order suspending Runions from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any firearm, other than for a short period of time, in violation of Section 5 of the Ohio Securities Act.  Additionally, the Court granted the request for a partial and unconditional pardon, which is subject to court approval, without prejudgment interest, from any of the defendants in the case.   The Court also granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (d) and 17 (b)(2)(A)(2).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against one of Runions' alleged accomplices in connection with the same criminal charges.  This case is being handled by John R. Jurgensen Co. and Amy S. Klotz of the Philadelphia Regional Office."
