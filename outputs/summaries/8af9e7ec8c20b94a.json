  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Illinois today entered an emergency court order against Steven M. Johnson, Esquire, a former trial counsel for GlaxoSmithKline, for refusing to pay a seven percent assessment to the Avandia Multidistrict Litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d) common benefit fund from claims that he settled in the state court action captioned Gabel v. Gabel, filed in the Twentieth Judicial Circuit in St. Clair County, Illinois, despite the court's prior ruling that he was obligated to pay the assessment on all settled claims in the Gabel litigation.  According to the SEC's order, Johnson, who was counsel to Gabel's co-counsel, failed to advise his clients that their recovery may be subject to the assessment, and that applying the assessment may result in payments to his co-Counsel that would otherwise be barred by Illinois rules concerning conflicts of interest.  The SEC's complaint charges Johnson with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Johnson arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  Johnson has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $1,038,865 in disgorging and prejudgment interests, plus a civil money penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Johnson agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a court order that imposes a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as trial counsel in the MDL for five years, with the right to reapply as a matter of law after five years.  On July 21, 2015, a federal court in Chicago issued an order requiring Gabel to hold 7% of its settlement fund in reserve, pending disposition of any MDL litigation related to its settlement with Gabel.  Gabel settled the same day, and Gabel received a similar amount of relief.  As a result of this order, Gabel and Johnson are entitled to a common benefit assessment that is independent of the judgments issued by the federal court.  This order requires Gabel defendants to pay, on a joint and several basis, a $10,000 civil penalty"
