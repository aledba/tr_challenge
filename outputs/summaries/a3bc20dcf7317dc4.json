  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Washington today entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, alleges that David Haggard, a California resident, committed multiple class C felonies while living in California.  According to the complaint, the legislature intended to allow the less-deserving, deferred sentence defendant to obtain vacation by filing for it under RCW 9.96.060, which is equivalent to vacation under the SRA.  However, the complaint alleges that the legislature did not consider that a deferred sentence should be included in a defendant's offender score when, in fact, the defendant had spent five consecutive years in the community without committing any crime that subsequently resulted in a conviction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.   The complaint also alleges that a defendant who was previously convicted of a felony had a prior felony conviction that had been vacated by a trial court, and that the defendant was entitled to a vacation of the same amount as he or she had been sentenced to.  As a result of the SEC\u2019s investigation, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, and the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the securities laws. The SEC also instituted a temporary restraining order, which temporarily halted the pendency of the litigation, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil monetary penalty of $1,000. The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review.  Finally, the court granted the SEC request for an asset freeze and an accounting of the defendants\u2019 prior criminal history, which was conducted by David Boerner and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Federal Office of Inspector General (OIGA) in this matter."
