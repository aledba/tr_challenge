  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska yesterday entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the Nebraska Appleseed Center for Law in the Public Interest.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Omaha, Nebraska, alleges that Nebraska Secretary of State John Gale violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to disclose to the public that they supported the expansion of Medicaid and that the proposed amendment violated the single subject rule because it did not meet the criteria set forth in the Exchange Act. The SEC also alleges that Christensen and Brasch misrepresented to the court that the initiative was not subject to the same reporting requirements as Exchange Act requirements, that Exchange Act reporting requirements, and that, in fact, Exchange Act Reporting requirements did not apply to the initiative. The court also found that the amended Exchange Act did not violate the reporting requirements for Exchange Act reports.  In a parallel action, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services today announced that it has obtained a court order halting the issuance of an emergency court order freezing the assets of Exchange Act-registered broker-dealers. Exchange Advisers, a registered broker dealer, has agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Nebraska Office of Insurance Regulation."
