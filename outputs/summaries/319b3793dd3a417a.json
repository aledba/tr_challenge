  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon today announced criminal charges against a Portland man accused of causing a disturbance at a night club.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, alleges that, from approximately 2:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Portland Police officers confronted a group of men who were engaged in a verbal altercation with security personnel at the club. According to the complaint, the officers confronted the men, who then began to push and kick at the security personnel. The complaint alleges that defendant, who was then restrained and pulled back by his companions, repeatedly shouted profanities, made violent threats to police officers, and escaped from custody. The SEC alleges that defendants did not engage in physical force or physical conduct that is immediately likely to produce the use of physical force. Instead, the complaint alleges, defendants engaged in aggressive, tumultuous or threatening behavior that is not incidental to speech, and that defendant did not attempt to punch or kick the officers. In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendant, finding him liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and a conduct-based injunction, and ordered the officers to comply with the court's order. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Kurt L. Gottschall of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
