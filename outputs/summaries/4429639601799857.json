  "summary": "The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services today announced that it has obtained a final judgment against Batool Sadeghzadeh, an Iranian national who seeks an EB-5 visa.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, Washington, alleges that Sadeh was denied entry to the United States because she failed to provide sufficient evidence to show that she had invested the necessary amount of capital in a new or troubled commercial enterprise in the country.  According to the complaint, on January 24, 2014, she submitted her Form I-526, claiming eligibility based on her investment of $500,000 in a Seattle real estate development in August 2013, known as the \"255 South Kin[g] Street Limited Partnership.\"  The complaint alleges that the AAO's decision was arbitrary and capricious, because it did not require her to provide proof of her investment, such as the amount of the invested funds, or the date of the sale of the gold coins.

It also filed a second complaint on July 18, 2018, seeking summary judgment on the basis of the court's order.  Among other things, the court found that the court had improperly elevated the burden of proof to determine whether to grant summary judgment.   In its order granting summary judgment, the agency also found that, in violation of the federal securities laws, it had failed to consider the relevant facts concerning the purchase and sale of gold coins, including that the purchase price was actually in Dubai, and that the seller of the coins had not sold the coins at the time of the coin sale.  As alleged, the order also found no reasonable basis for denying her entry because, as a matter of law, she had not provided sufficient documentation to prove her investment was lawful, including the amount she received from selling the coins and the date the coin was sold.  Finally, the Court found that"
