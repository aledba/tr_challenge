  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Iowa today entered a final judgment against Banilla Games, Inc., a North Carolina-based company that manufactures and sells electronic gaming devices.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Des Moines, Iowa, alleges that Banilla violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and the registration provisions of Sections 99B.53(1) and (2)(b).  The complaint also alleges that the Department of Justice improperly held Banilla with the authority to determine whether a player can win on the Superior Skill games.  According to the complaint, Banilla failed to show that he or she had the skill or knowledge to successfully play the game.  Banilla's complaint further alleges that, contrary to the Department\u2019s findings, the player cannot win the Super Skill games without having the skill and knowledge of the operator.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Banilla from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,065, prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for the Middle District of New York today announced criminal charges against both Banilla and his company for their roles in the alleged scheme.  On May 24, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering Banilla to comply with the order.  Sansone also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17A.19(1).
