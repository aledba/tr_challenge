  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered final judgments against the College of Philadelphia, Local 2026, and the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Court also entered a final judgment in favor of the College, agreeing to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin the College from violating the federal, state, and municipal securities laws, and ordering the college to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Department of Education today announced that it has obtained a court order halting a partial strike by full-time faculty at the college.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on September 15, 2017, the College and the union filed a complaint with the court alleging that, in 2012-2013, during ongoing negotiations for the parties' previous collective bargaining agreement, the college instructed full-tim faculty to perform required assessment work while continuing to accept full pay and benefits.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the College's Complaint, the school district and the court agreed that the college had exclusive jurisdiction over the college's alleged violations of the federal and state securities laws and that the court had jurisdiction to determine whether an unfair labor practice has occurred and, if so, to prevent a party from continuing the practice in the Board's jurisdiction.  Additionally, the court found that the College violated Section 1003 of the Pennsylvania Public Employer Relations Act, and that it lacked jurisdiction to enjoin a strike under Section 1004 of the PERA, which is reserved for the courts.   The college's complaint charges the college with violations of Section 1301 of the Commission on Higher Education, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On October 23, 2018, the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia granted the college a temporary restraining order and issued an order suspending the college from participating in any strike or in any other action that may arise from the Commission's investigation of the matter.

Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Police Department, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Department of Health and Human Services, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service and the U."
