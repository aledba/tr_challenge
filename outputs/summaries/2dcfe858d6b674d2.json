According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, Allen, who was a member of the E-Ricket Hunter Bloods street gang, was on his way home from work around 11:30 p.m. on the evening of 14 June 2013 when he saw a car drive past him at the basketball court.

Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders"
