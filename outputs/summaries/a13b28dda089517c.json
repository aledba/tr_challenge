  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Spectrum Security Services, Inc., a California-based company that provides security services to federal and state agencies.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, California, alleges that Spectrum violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Spectrum violated Section 226 of the Exchange Act by failing to include in its wage and hour policies a provision requiring employees to provide for meal and rest breaks.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 226, Spectrum failed to include the provision of a right-to-revoke clause in the wage and rest break policies.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Spectrum consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders it to pay disgorgement of $1,393,314 plus prejudgment interest of seven percent, and orders the company to pay a civil penalty of $399,950.  Spectrum also agreed to pay an attorney fee of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of attorney fees it will pay to the employer.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On June 9, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Spectrum, charging it with violations of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint charges Spectrum with violating Section 226 and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of that provision, as well as civil penalties against the company, and an officer-and-director bar against Spectrum.  To settle the case, Spectrum agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations, ordering a hearing on the matter, and imposing a $100,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-2001.  Separately, the Department of Justice announced criminal charges against Spectrum for its role in this matter.  A hearing is scheduled for July 11, 2019. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Office of Inspector General."
