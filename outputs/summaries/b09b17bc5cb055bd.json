  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Montana today announced criminal charges against Zachary Tucker Martin.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on June 19, 2016, Martin pleaded guilty to two felony counts of robbery by accountability and assault with a weapon and was sentenced to a total of twenty years in prison.  According to the complaint, Martin raised the issue of whether the court should impose a PFO designation on him based on his prior felony conviction.  Martin agreed to the court's recommendation that Martin be sentenced as a repeat PFO based on the court\u2019s finding that Martin had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 46-18-502, the federal securities laws, and the sentencing requirements of \u00a7 46-13-108, the state sentencing laws.  In addition, Martin consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his previous sentence.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Martin has agreed to a permanent injunction, to be barred from serving any prison term, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.  On July 5, 2017, the District Court issued a written judgment, in which it designated Martin a \"Subsequent Persistent Felony Offender\" (PFO) for sentencing under the federal sentencing laws, which requires the court to determine whether a defendant is a \"PFO\" by sentencing him as a \"regular\" or \"repeat PFO.\"  The court also ordered Martin to pay restitution of $1,078, which he already had paid, in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the court.  Additionally, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Martin, ordering him to surrender his passport, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against him.  A hearing for Martin was scheduled for May 30, 2017.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17, July 11, 2016.  An SEC complaint filed in federal district court in Yellowstone, Montana, charges Martin with violating the federal, state, and local securities laws and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $50,000. The complaint also names Martin as a defendant with a history of prior felony convictions, including a prior conviction for attempted sexual intercourse without consent and a previous felony conviction for which Martin was convicted in 2012. The SEC seeks a permanent officer and director bar and a penalty of five years and a penny bar against Martin. Martin has consented"
