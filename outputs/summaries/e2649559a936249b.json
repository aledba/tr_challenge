  "summary": "On January 16, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Facebook, Inc. (\"Facebook\") in a civil injunctive action against the company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Facebook violated the antifraud provisions of Section 2702 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to disclose the existence of an ex parte subpoena for information related to the shooting of Marquette Brown on December 6, 2018.  According to the complaint, Mr. Pepe's subpoena sought evidence from Brown that he had been carrying a weapon during one of their previous confrontations and warned him not to ride the A6 bus.  In its order, the court ruled that the subpoena was unenforceable because it required Facebook to provide a copy of the subpoena to the court.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Facebook consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws, orders it to comply with the subpoena, and orders the company to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Additionally, the judgment prohibits Facebook from providing any copy of a subpoena to any person or entity, with the exception of its own counsel, until after the court has determined that there is sufficient evidence to justify a subpoena.  On January 17, 2020 the court granted Facebook's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered it to provide the court with an accounting of the number of days it has been able to hold a hearing in which it will consider whether to issue a subpoena or not.  It also ordered Facebook not to provide any other information to the SEC until it had obtained a subpoena for Brown's account.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Facebook.  This case is the latest in a series of actions by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General that the SEC has issued in this matter.  Among other things, the SEC previously issued an order requiring the FBI to obtain a warrant for a search warrant for Mr. Brown's Instagram account in response to a subpoena issued by the Department of Justice.  As part of its investigation, the FBI conducted an extensive search of the social media accounts of people who had been subpoenaed by the FBI, and the case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. The FBI's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by"
