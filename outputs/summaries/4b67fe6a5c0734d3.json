  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Gregory B.D., a 17-year-old who was charged with stealing from an at-risk person.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York on June 27, 2018, B.d. was charged as a complicitor for two counts of felony burglary, one of which was enhanced to a class 5 felony, and a third count of theft.  The complaint alleges that B. D. made a series of incriminating statements while subject to custodial interrogation, including that he had had alcohol in his backpack and had come face-to-face with one of the intruders as the intruder ran past him and out of the house.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendant had no reason to believe that he would be arrested before telling the officer about the alleged theft, and that he was not in custody when he made the incriminating statement.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that when the defendant made the statement to Sergeant Tomasetti, he was in a position of trust, whether or not she knew the amount of drugs in the backpack, and whether any limitation of movement or other form of restraint was placed on the defendant during the search.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, B-D. consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000.  B-d. also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to a five-year officer-director bar, and to be restrained and restrained from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any security deposit or other security deposit.  Finally, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New Jersey Office of Inspector General in this matter."
