  "summary": "On September 10, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky entered a final judgment against Cambridge Franchise Holdings, LLC and Nashville Quality, LLC, agreeing to settle a civil injunctive action brought by the Federal Bureau of Investigation against them.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky, alleges that Cambridge Franchise and its affiliated entities violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Cambridge and its associated entities violated Section 5 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Rules of Conduct by failing to provide sufficient evidence to determine whether the parties agreed to arbitrate.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to provide any proof that the parties signed the arbitration agreement.

Additionally, the court entered an order freezing the defendants' assets, freezing their assets, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $3,500.

For further information, see Litigation Release No. 10-cv-00856-GNS, March 4, 2019.  On September 11, 2020, the SEC filed a complaint against Cambridge, alleging that it had violated the Exchange Act and Rules 5a-14, 13a-1, 12b-20, and 13b-13 thereunder, and that Cambridge had violated Exchange Act Rule 5b-14 by signing a forged arbitration agreement on the same day she signed it. The complaint also alleged that the Commission issued an Order suspending the Defendants from appearing, practicing, or practicing as a member of a Commission on the subject of arbitration. The Commission's order freezes the Defendants' assets and prohibits them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any"
