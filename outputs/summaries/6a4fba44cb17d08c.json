  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of a second-degree felony for his role in a domestic violence and stalking case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, Brian Brush violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Brush violated Section 9.94A.535(3)(h)(i) as part of an ongoing pattern of psychological abuse of Bonney manifested by multiple incidents over a prolonged period of time.  As alleged in the complaint, Brush violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rules 206(3) and 207(4)-8 thereunder, and Section 9 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Brush consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.  Brush also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be restrained from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Brush.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Oregon Department of Justice in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.  For example, the SEC encourages investors to use the investor's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly check whether their investments are being used for the right to return funds to their retirement accounts."
