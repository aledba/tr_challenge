  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Uber and Kessanti, finding that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on the night of October 4, 2014, two college students were hit by an Uber driver while attempting to cross Kedzie Avenue in Chicago.  According to the complaint, the driver failed to yield to an oncoming car and, instead of using the Uber app to transport the students, he drove through a poorly lit, high-traffic area with limited traffic control devices.  As alleged, the defendants' actions were so beyond the ordinary expectation of the driver that they could not be expected to make that determination on their own.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the driver was reckless in failing to yield at a stop sign, resulting in the victims' injuries.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against each of them.  On May 8, 2017, the court granted a preliminary injunction against the defendants from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000, $20,000 and $50,000.  A hearing on May 9, 2017 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, the Illinois Department of Insurance, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (January 24, 2019).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant a driver who was not criminally liable for his or her negligent driving and for his/her role in causing or abetting the violations of Section 9-112.010 of the Chicago Municipal Code.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, under the supervision of Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter."
