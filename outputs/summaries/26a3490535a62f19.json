  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Epicous Adventure Travel, LLC (Epicous), a Texas-based travel agency, and two New Jersey residents for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, Epicous sought a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an injunction to prevent it from violating the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that Epicous entered into a contract with Socialfix Media, Inc., a New York corporation, to design and develop a website that included a \"hovering overlay\" that would show different images as the user moved their cursor over the webpage.  As alleged in the complaint, the Socialfix defendants never directly communicated with the company, but instead used a third-party website to solicit funds for the website.  Instead, the complaint alleges, they made numerous false and misleading statements about the nature and nature of the exchange of information on the socialfix defendants' websites.  For example, the SEC alleges that Socialfix had no contacts with any of the companies involved in the alleged transaction, and that the defendants did not send any materials to the third party.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders Epicous to pay disgorgement of $43,500, plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $75,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On December 19, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted Epicous's motion for summary judgment, ordering a permanent injunction, and ordering a hearing on January 24, 2018 to determine whether to proceed with the litigation.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the Fort Worth Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by John R. Rymas and Ms. Moriarty.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
