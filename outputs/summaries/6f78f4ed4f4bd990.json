  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a default judgment against a Missouri man who was charged with defrauding his wife and three minor children out of more than $1 million.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 18, 2017, Vanessa Genise Wise and her husband, Bruce Edward Wise, Jr., filed a complaint for a divorce in the trial court in Dale County, Missouri. The complaint alleged that the mother had moved to Missouri in October 2016 to be closer to her husband and to live with the children, and that she had called the courts several times since the divorce judgment was entered.  The complaint also alleged that, upon notification of the summons and complaint being placed in the record, the mother avoided service and attempted to avoid service.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the court granted the mother's motion to set aside the default judgment and granted the father custody of the children subject to the court's approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Kirtland complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71 plus prejudgment interest of $2,038.71, a civil penalty of $100,000, and a penny stock bar against the defendants.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the mother and father of three children in connection with her alleged scheme to defraud the children.  On August 2, 2018, a federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi entered an order granting the mother a temporary restraining order and ordering her to return to her home state of Missouri to be enjoined from further violations of Rule 12(b)(2) and (c) thereunder of the federal securities laws. The court also issued an order requiring the mother to comply with the court order by the date of her entry of the judgment, which requires her to show cause and effect in a timely fashion.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Burt of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The litigation will be led by Ms. Genise and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Attorney General's Office in this matter and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office."
