  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted on a charge of second-degree rape in violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina on January 7, 2019, alleges that, from at least December 2010 through December 2013, a defendant named a victim in an indictment for a first-degree sexual offense with a child by an adult, stating that he engaged in a sexual act with the victim under the age of 13 years, naming the victim as a \"victim #1\" rather than naming the child as the short-form indictment statute for the offense directs.  According to the complaint, the indictment also failed to mention that the alleged victim was a member of a church or other place of religious worship, not a separate entity that must be alleged.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant confessed in writing to the crime after, in the course of committing the larceny, he damaged copper wire located on the property.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 300 to 369 months of imprisonment.  On January 8, 2020, the Honorable J. Thomas Davis of the United States District Court in Charlotte entered a judgment ordering a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordering him to comply with the court's order. The court also issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering the defendant to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the FBI, and the FBI's Criminal Investigations Division in this matter."
