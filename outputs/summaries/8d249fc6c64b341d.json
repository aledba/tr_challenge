  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment in favor of terminating the parental rights of two children.  The SEC's complaint alleges that on June 3, 2015, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (IDHW) obtained a court order to terminate parental rights to two children, D.E. and T.E., in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the complaint, the court found that the children were in the best interests of their parents when, in reality, the children had been in foster care for approximately thirty-eight and thirty-one months.  In addition, the complaint alleged that, despite repeated efforts to provide for the children, Father failed to complete his case plan and failed to comply with the court\u2019s orders and case plans.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On October 5, 2018, a federal district court in Idaho issued an order to halt the termination of parental rights for two of the children in the custody of IDHW. The court also issued a temporary restraining order halting the children from accessing the internet and other services provided by the agency, freezing the children's assets, and imposing an officer-and-director bar.   The court granted the court's order and ordered the children to be placed with their grandparents, who are currently in the process of recovering from substance abuse and other issues related to their release from the agency.

Basinger and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the Idaho Office of Child and Family Education and Advocacy."
