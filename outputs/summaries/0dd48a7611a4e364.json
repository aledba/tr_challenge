  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Florida-based attorney William K. Hill, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a total of $1,148,210.89 in fees and $33,448.57 in expenses.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that the Florida Department of Corrections (D.C. Department of Justice) censored Prison Legal News because it contained advertisements for certain services.  According to the complaint, the defendants spent at least four hours preparing and preparing the materials for the litigation, and more than one attorney attended depositions that only one attorney conducted.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to adequately account for the amount of time spent on each of these tasks.  For example, as alleged in the SEC's Complaint, defendants were not required to cover all of the fees incurred by attorneys on the same case, and defendants did not have the time to prepare the materials.  As a result, defendants are not entitled to the same amount of attorneys' fees as they would have been entitled to if a reasonable fee had been awarded to them.  Additionally, defendants' fees were not included in the total amount of attorney's fees paid to the parties.   The court's order against Hill, which was entered in a parallel administrative proceeding, orders him to disgorge $2,123,722.34 in fees with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $6,083.57, which will be determined by the court upon motion by the parties at a later date.  On the same day, the SEC issued an order suspending Hill from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Hill consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, imposes a $25,000 civil penalty, and prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States.  Hill agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, and ordered to pay disgorgement of $3,253,078.71, plus $189,876.71 in fees, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  He also agreed to pay an $8,500 civil penalty and a $50,000 penalty.  This settlement is subject to court approval. "
