  "summary": "On June 27, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against A.Y. Basinger, a New Jersey man who was convicted of second-degree sexual assault in 2005, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in New Jersey on June 27 and unsealed on June 28, 2018, Judge Freedman agreed with the Court's order that A.y. be involuntarily committed to the Special Treatment Unit as a \"sexually violent predator.\"  The Court also granted the Court\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against a second-time offender for his role in a string of sexual assaults.  On June 29, 2019, the Court granted the court-ordered injunction, ordered a hearing on June 30, and ordered a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, the court also ordered that the defendant be permanently enjoined from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws and ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a $10,000 civil penalty.  A hearing scheduled for June 30 will be conducted by David G. Kuehner, Ph.D., a clinical trial judge, and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The court will determine the amount of monetary relief to be provided by the court upon motion of the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 17-cv-17-19 (2014).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigatory Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage people to check the backgrounds of people who commit or are suspected of committing an act of sexual violence using the SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser Detection and Detection tool.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI Criminal Investigation, and other relevant authorities in this matter."
