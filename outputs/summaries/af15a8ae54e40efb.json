  "summary": "On May 3, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington entered a preliminary injunction against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Office of Population Affairs (OPA) from implementing or enforcing the Final Rule on Title X family planning programs.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, Washington, alleges that the HHS violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1554 of the federal government's Family Planning and Health Services Act (FPA) by failing to provide timely and cost-effective family planning services to low-income patients.  According to the complaint, the Department's Final Rule, which is subject to court approval, prohibits certain health care providers from providing abortions as a method of family planning, imposes unreasonable barriers for patients to obtain timely access to health care services, and imposes additional and unnecessary costs on the State of Washington and other states.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in the absence of a court order, the HSH will not implement or enforce the proposed Final Rule.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requires them to provide a civil injunctive proceeding against the other defendants. The final judgment also prohibits the Department from imposing a penny stock bar on any individual or organization that receives federal funds for family planning. The court will determine the amount of relief to be provided by the court upon motion of the parties.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-3045-SAB, April 25, 2019. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Federal Office of Health Education and Advocacy."
