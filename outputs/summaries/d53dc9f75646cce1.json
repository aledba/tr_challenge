  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against Wendy Willprecht, a self-employed farmer, her husband, and their two adult children in a civil action for child support violations.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order halting the settlement.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cass County, W.D.C., on May 24, 2019, the court found that Wendy WillPrecht violated the antifraud provisions of Section 14-05-24 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered her to pay a civil penalty of $750,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Kevin Willprech, his wife, and two other individuals in connection with the alleged violations of the federal anti-fraud provisions.  On May 26, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against both defendants.  To settle the case, the Court granted the defendants the right to cross-examine the facts of the case and determine the appropriate amount of restitution to be paid.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2,076,302 and $3,562,998, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. The court further ordered the defendants to make an equalization payment to each party as part of the equitable distribution of the property and debts of the parties.  As a result of the court\u2019s order, the parties will have more than $1 million in assets available to their household for the purpose of paying child support.  Additionally, the judge will have the discretion to determine whether to issue an order permanently enjoining the parties from violating Section 15a(a)(2) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1.  He will also have the option to issue a judgment ordering him to pay an equalized amount of his child support obligation as well as a penalty in the same amount as he would have received if the court had issued an order requiring him to do so.
