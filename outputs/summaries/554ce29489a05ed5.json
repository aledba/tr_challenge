  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon in possession of a.22 caliber pistol.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, in September 2012, Frank Taylor stole the gun from an Oakwood, Georgia man's home. According to the complaint, the gun was hidden behind a refrigerator in the motel room. The complaint further alleges that the investigator told the investigator that he purchased the gun when he was investigating a burglary in which a firearm was stolen.  As alleged, the investigator corroborated the investigator's testimony, and the complaint alleges that Jones admitted to purchasing the gun.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Atlanta today announced criminal charges against Taylor.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Jones consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  Jones also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the sale or purchase of a security deposit in the name of a public company or company, and that he will not be liable for prejudgment interest in the sale of the security deposit.  Finally, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Taylor, which prohibits him from making or selling any offer of securities in the future, and ordered him to be restrained from making any statements to the SEC or to the Commission concerning the purchase and sale of a firearm. The SEC also issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct a background check on any person selling or offering to sell a firearm, including those who are registered to sell or offer to sell the same security deposit as the person selling the firearm.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC issued a subpoena for a copy of the subpoena, which was obtained by the SEC through the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Fraud Task Force. The subpoena is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Atlanta Regional Office, and Ms. Gibson is supervising the case."
