  "summary": "On October 19, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Goldman Sachs for securities fraud and common law violations.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges Goldman with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that, in 2007, Goldman sold two securities it knew to be \"junk\" and then made margin calls on the securities shortly after selling them to Basis.  According to the complaint, Goldman's misrepresentations and omissions did not concern facts peculiarly within the seller's knowledge.  Instead, the complaint alleges that Goldman was a mere \"contrarian\" looking to capitalize on over-priced long RMBS bets that would be unprofitable when the housing prices collapsed, contrary to the general belief at the time that prices would continue to perpetually rise.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Goldman consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Goldman also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay an officer and director bar in the amount of $10,000 and a $100,000 civil penalty.  On October 21, 2011, the court granted Goldman's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, ordered a hearing on the matter, and issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of certain of the collateralized debt obligation (CDO) and mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).  The receiver has agreed to a settlement where he or she will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, and the receiver will be required to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver."
