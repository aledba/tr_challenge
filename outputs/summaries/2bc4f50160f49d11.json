  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama today entered a final judgment against the state of Alabama in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that the Alabama Department of Health and Human Services violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the federal law prohibits the dismemberment abortion of an unborn child, and requires that the procedure be performed in an outpatient setting.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order suspending enforcement of the federal anti-fraud provisions.  On March 2, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the U. S. District Judge in Birmingham entered an order temporarily restraining the imposition of an injunction, ordering a hearing on the matter, and appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an order imposing an injunction against the proposed injunction. The court's order also temporarily suspended the scheduled hearing for March 24, 2019.  A hearing scheduled for March 26, 2019 is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Press Release No. 5, 2018."
