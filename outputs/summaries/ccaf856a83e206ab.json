  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Emigrant Mortgage Company, a New York City-based mortgage lender, and its co-defendant, Felipe Howell, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Emigrant and Howell violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to show sufficient evidence to show that they were liable for the alleged violations of the federal securities laws.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants did not adequately disclose to the jury that they had been targeted by Emigrant for a long period of time.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Emigrant misrepresented that the loans were predatory and targeted certain minority communities, including those with significant equity in their homes.  For example, the SEC alleges that, in 2010, the jury found Emigrant liable for violations of Section 15(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), Rule 15a-1 thereunder, and Rule 15b2-2 thereunder; and that the complaint was filed in violation of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(3) of Exchange Act Rules 206(4)-8.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  Additionally, the court granted Emigrant's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants, as well as an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of certain of the properties.  On June 27, 2016, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the United States District Court in Manhattan granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered Emigrant to comply with the court order, and ordered the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to each of the parties in the case.  Finally, the Court granted the relief sought by the SEC in its Complaint against Howell and the other defendants.   The court also granted the receiver's request to appoint a receiver, and the receiver agreed to the appointment of a receiver. "
