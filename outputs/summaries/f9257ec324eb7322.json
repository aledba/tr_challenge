  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the National Park Service for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that identity thieves made fraudulent charges on her debit card at some unspecified time after she visited Yellowstone National Park.  According to the complaint, the Park Service issued a receipt showing the expiration date of the card on which Daniel purchased the card. The complaint alleges that the receipt was used fraudulently and she suffered damages from her stolen identity.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the federal government has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Daniel for his role in the alleged scheme. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Daniel, charging him with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charging Daniel with aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and ordered Daniel to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. Daniel agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1771 (2014). The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice in this matter."
