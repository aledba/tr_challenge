  "summary": "On February 6, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a condominium association for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, alleges that, in October 2013, a member of the association refused to show him the video recording of an October 4 meeting in which the association imposed a $500,000 civil penalty on Boucher.  According to the complaint, Boucher, who lives in the condominium building where the complaint was filed, repeatedly demanded that the board record the October 4 hearing.  Boucher also allegedly demanded that he pay cash for the replacement of his key card.  In a parallel action, on February 7, 2014, the United States District Court in Chicago entered a judgment against Boucher that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws.  On February 8, 2019, the court granted the SEC's motion for summary judgment against the defendants on count III, finding that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties by failing to disclose to the board that Boucher had engaged in conduct that constituted a violation of the federal fiduciaries' duty to the unit owners.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged provisions, ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and ordering Boucher to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The judgment also prohibits Boucher from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any condominium property, including residential units, without a prior written consent from the association or the board of directors. The court also granted the defendants a temporary restraining order, barring them from making any material misrepresentations or omissions to the court in connection with the conduct of the unit owner, and prohibiting them from conducting business with the unit. The order also prohibits the defendants from using the unregistered broker-dealer as a basis for imposing any civil penalties.  A hearing for Boucher is scheduled for May 17, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-19, Litigation Bulletin No. 13-20-19.  An SEC order appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver will be issued on May 24, 2019 to determine whether to issue an order imposing a permanent injunction, imposing civil penalties, and imposing officer-and-director and penny stock bars. The receiver will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and"
