  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against CSX Transportation, Inc., New York Central Lines, LLC, and NYC Newco, Inc. (collectively, \"defendants\") for their failure to preserve event recorder data in the Lyons, New York area.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, on June 16, 2006, former train engineer Stephen Timko provided testimony in support of the defendants' motion for summary judgment in a civil injunctive action brought by the court against Timko.  The SEC alleges that Timko's testimony was based on his knowledge and experience in the railroad industry, and that he was not prejudiced by the loss of the data.  As alleged in the complaint, however, Timko failed to adequately assess whether or not the train's bell and horn were sounded prior to movement of the train.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he failed to check the laptop's contents before uploading the data to the cloud-based system.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  On August 2, 2017, the court granted a motion by the SEC to bar Timko from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert in any matter concerning the safety of train travel. The SEC's order also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of the proceeds of a public offering of a penny stock. The court also granted a request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering Timko to comply with the court's order, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the SEC is seeking an order appointing an independent receiver to oversee the collection and preservation of event recorder information, including the destruction of any evidence that may be relevant to the determination of liability.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (June 24, 2006).  The complaint also seeks an order ordering the destruction and destruction of documents related to the alleged failure of the event recorder to be included in the final judgment.  Finally, the Court granted a subpoena"
