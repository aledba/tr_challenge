  "summary": "On October 11, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against the manufacturers of e-cigarettes, cigars, and other newly-approved products.  The court found that the manufacturers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder and the premarket review provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) of this federal securities law. The court also found that, in violation of Section 5(b)(5), the federal securities laws, and Rule 5b-5, thereunder, that the companies violated the pre-market review provision of the Act and that the agency had no authority to suspend or revoke those provisions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against one of the manufacturers. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges the manufacturers with violating Section 5, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the manufacturers have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged provisions, ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On October 13, 2018 the U-S Attorney's office for the Northern District of California announced criminal proceedings against the defendants.  According to the SEC, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged sections of the securities laws and orders them to comply with the court's order. The final judgment also orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and a $75,000 penalty.  Without admitting to the Commission's findings, the companies agreed to the settlement. The settlements are pending final approval by the court. The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David A. Kasper and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by David E. Schiff. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
