  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a former security guard who was found ineligible to receive unemployment benefits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that on May 15, 2018, Tracy D. Leach, a security guard at Hawthorne Race Course, Inc., filed a claim for unemployment benefits on the basis that he was not actively seeking work. According to the complaint, Leach told the claims adjudicator that he had requested a leave of absence and that the Department of Employment Security would welcome his return. The complaint further alleges that Leach failed to provide a written job search record and could not recall two jobs he had sought in a four-week period.  Leach also allegedly failed to register as a full-time employee with the Illinois Job Link, despite repeated requests to do so.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Leach.  On May 22, 2018 the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Leach to comply with the court's order. The court also issued an order suspending Leach from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against him.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint filed in the federal district court for the Northern District of Michigan, the SEC has agreed to a permanent injunction and to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
