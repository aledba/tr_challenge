  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Carnival Corporation d.b.a. Carnival Cruise Lines (Carnival) in an arbitration case.  The court found that Cvoro violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, on June 10, 2014, the Court found that Carnival violated the federal securities laws when it failed to enforce an arbitration award for a seaman with carpal tunnel syndrome. The court also found that the arbitration award was void as to public policy because it did not meet the criteria required under the Exchange Act.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Cvora. The SEC also announced that it would conduct an investigation into Cvosa\u2019s claims, which was conducted by Andrew M. Campbell and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division in the Miami Regional Office. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FINCA) in this matter, the United States Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FIEA)."
