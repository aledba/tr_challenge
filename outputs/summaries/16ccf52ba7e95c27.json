  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maine today announced criminal charges against two men accused of defrauding his children out of more than $1 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Maine, alleges that the defendants failed to establish that they were entitled to the services that are ordinarily provided in a title 22 child protection action after a court has found abuse or neglect or has placed a child in foster care under the supervision of the Department of Health and Human Services.  According to the complaint, the defendants also failed to show sufficient evidence to support their claims that they had been deprived of due process and equal protection under the federal and state constitutions.  In addition, the complaint alleges that each of the fathers failed to adequately assess and remediate his or her parenting deficits and failed to provide evidence of any resulting rehabilitation or reunification services.  Without admitting or denying the defendants' allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1.4 million, a civil penalty of $100,000, and a $50,000 civil penalty for each of them. The Defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal, state, and municipal securities laws, and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the termination of their parental rights. The defendants agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to permanent injunctions and to the issuance of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from further violating the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval. The court granted the Defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlements are subject to Court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maine Department of Children and Family Services, and the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services."
