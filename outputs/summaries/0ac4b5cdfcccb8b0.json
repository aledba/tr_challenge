  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against Purdue University employee Maciste Coleman for failing to comply with the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on August 28, 2014, Coleman was driving his motorcycle in the right lane going southbound on 23rd Street NW toward Constitutive Avenue when he was hit by a car. The complaint alleges that, as a result of the accident, Coleman sustained severe, painful and permanent injuries to his body as well as severe and protracted shock to his nervous system.  The complaint further alleges that Coleman failed to provide prompt notice of his claims as required by the Indiana Tort Claims Act, and that he was unable to timely respond to the complaint because he was unaware that the state had issued a written notice for the accident.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Coleman.  On July\u00c2\u00a020, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Coleman, charging him with violations of Section 12(b)(1) and Section 13(a) and 13(c) and 14(a)(1)(A) and 15(b).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Hall and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Mr. Coleman. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Indiana Department of Insurance, and the Indiana State Corporation Commission in this matter."
