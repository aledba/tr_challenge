  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against Troy Scheffler, a former Kentucky state trooper, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Louisville, Kentucky, alleges that, on May 17, 2013, a Kentucky trooper arrested Scheffling for making a false arrest in connection with an ongoing criminal investigation. The complaint alleges that Schefflers, who was arrested without a warrant, repeatedly told the officer that he would be arrested if he did not cooperate with the investigation. According to the complaint, however, the officer did not engage in any aggressive or aggressive conduct. Instead, Scheffles allegedly engaged in a series of aggressive actions, including slamming his head against a car, kicking his legs apart, and making a profanity-laced statement to the officer. In addition, the complaint further alleges that the officer was not restrained by any reasonable officer and did not use excessive force. The SEC also found that, in a parallel action, the Kentucky State Attorney General's Office filed a civil injunctive action, charging the trooper with a felony for his role in the alleged conduct. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, and ordered the officer to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The judge granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered the trooper to comply with the court order, and issued an order suspending the officer from further violations of the securities laws, ordering the officer and director of the Kentucky Department of Public Safety to jointly and severally supervise the officer's activities. The order also imposed a conduct-based injunction, which prohibits officers from using excessive force, including without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, and requires officers to show reasonable cause to arrest a person. In a parallel administrative proceeding, the court issued a temporary asset freeze and ordered Lee to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, prejudgment interest of $2,038.71 and a civil penalties of $100,000, and a $50,000 officer- and director-and/director bar. The administrative proceeding was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit and supervised by Scott A. Thompson. The case is being supervised by Amy S. Cotter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
