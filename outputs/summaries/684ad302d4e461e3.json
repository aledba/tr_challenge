  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas on June 9, 2017, entered a final judgment against Reginald D. Kane, Jr., a Kansas City, Kansas man who was convicted of two felony counts of attempted first-degree murder and kidnapping.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Wichita, Kansas, Kane, who was a resident of Kansas City at the time of the alleged crime, entered the restaurant at gunpoint and demanded money from the cash register counter.  The complaint alleges that as Kane demanded the money, he shot at Acosta, who refused to give him the cash.  As alleged in the complaint, Kane followed Acosta into the restaurant through the back door and shot at him, causing Acosta to fall to the ground and collapse.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Kane.  Kane has agreed to settle those charges by consenting to the entry of an order permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Kane has also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kansas Securities and Exchange Commission in this matter."
