  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against BNSF Railway Company, Inc. (\"BNSF\"), a freight train company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Nall was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease in 2010 and was placed on medical leave in 2012. The complaint alleges that Nall failed to show that he was qualified to perform the duties of a trainman or switchman, and that he failed to demonstrate that he could perform the job duties as described in the medical status form.  The complaint further alleges that, after learning of the issues raised by the complaint, he did not return to work despite repeated requests to do so.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New York announced criminal charges against Nall. The SEC also announced that it would seek a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws. The court also issued an order suspending Nall from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any securities that may be deemed to be securities in the future.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins it from violating these provisions. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 8, 2013).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Werner, Ms. Braunstein, and Mr. Werner. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
