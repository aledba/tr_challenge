  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Mark Orlando, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison for orchestrating a double murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges Orlando with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Orlando and Herva Jeannot, who was a co-defendant in the double murder, lured Calabrese to the remote location near Long Beach, New York, on the pretext of meeting to pay a $17,000 gambling debt.  According to the complaint, Orlando and Jeannot agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Orlando from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $2,700 in civil penalties and to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a witness.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Orlando consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provision, ordering him to be permanently enjoined from participating in any future solicitation of the sale or purchase of a firearm, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against him.  He also agreed to be prohibited from appearing before the court as an attorney or practicing as a public figure.    In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Orlando based on the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  Among other things, Orlando pleaded guilty in a parallel criminal case to one count of securities fraud in which he was convicted by a jury of 10 men and sentenced to prison for a total of 17 years.  To settle the SEC case, Orlando agreed to a permanent injunction prohibiting him from appearing and practicing before a jury, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,700.  Orlando also agreed not to participate in the solicitation of a jury for the purpose of recovering stolen property from his alleged accomplice, who also was convicted in a separate criminal case.  As a result, Orlando has not been able to cross-examine certain of the other defendants in his criminal case, and the SEC has not issued an order requiring him to do so.  Additionally, the court has not ordered Orlando to pay any civil penalties, and he has not agreed to cooperate with the SEC in any way with the investigation that is being conducted by the Office of Inspector General of the New York Division of Criminal Investigations.
