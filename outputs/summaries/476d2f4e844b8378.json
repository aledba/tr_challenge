  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New Hampshire today entered a final judgment against Dartmouth College against the college for denying its site plan application for an indoor practice facility (IPF).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Hanover, New Hampshire, Dartmouth submitted an application for site plan approval in March 2016 for the construction of a 69,860 square foot IPF next to the college's 41-acre athletic complex. The complaint alleges that the college failed to meet the specific requirements of Hanover's site plan regulations, including that the IPF is massive and out of character with the abutting residential neighborhood, and that the building would block out the sun and shadow homes in the neighborhood for 7 months of the year.  The complaint further alleges that Dartmouth failed to consider the pros and cons of its application, including the potential impact on the neighborhood and its residents, and failed to justify its denial of the application.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Dartmouth consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the college to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Massachusetts Office of Planning and Inspections."
