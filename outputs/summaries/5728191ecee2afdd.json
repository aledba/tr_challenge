  "summary": "On January 9, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas entered a temporary restraining order against Securus Technologies, Inc. (\"Securus\"), a company that provides Inmate Calling Services to more than 3,400 public safety, law enforcement, and corrections agencies and over 1.2 million inmates.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Arkansas, Securus violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Securus's subpoena seeks irrelevant documents and oral testimony in connection with a pending motion to compel Securus to comply with a subpoena issued by the SEC in March 2014.  Securus has agreed to settle the SEC action by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Securus from violating the federal securities laws, orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and requires Securus' payment of civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC and Securus have agreed to a permanent injunction, to the issuance of a court order, and to the payment of a civil penalty of $100,000, to be determined by the court at a later date. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Andrew Lipman and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Lipman. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, with litigation assistance from Eric R. Werner, Regional Director of the Atlanta Regional Office, and Senior Trial Counsel for the Division of Criminal Justice.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Arkansas Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Arkansas Attorney General's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0instant search tool\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to identify whether their clients are subject to subpoenas.  For example,\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's Retail Strategy Task Force encourages investors to \"check the background\" before purchasing or selling investments."
