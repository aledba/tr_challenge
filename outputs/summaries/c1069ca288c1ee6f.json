  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the California Fish and Game Commission's motion to delist coho salmon from the list of threatened species.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, California, alleges that the Commission violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it failed to consider the merits of the Commission's recommendation.  According to the complaint, the Commission failed to determine whether the Commission had sufficient scientific or commercial information to justify delisting the species from the listing.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants had provided no credible evidence to support their claims that coho were not threatened with extinction and that, in fact, they were \"no longer threatened.\"  The Commission's final judgment, which permanently enjoins the Commission from delisting coho, requires the Commission to conduct a periodic, five-year species review, and to consider whether to consider delisting a species at any time.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the parties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by the Office of the Director of the San Francisco Regional Office, and the Division of Fish, Wildlife, and Inspection Services.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Department of Natural Resources, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of San Francisco and the California Secretary of State's Office.  For further information, see Press Release No. 2074.4, June 17, 2004, July 24, 2004."
