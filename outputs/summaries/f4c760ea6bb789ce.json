  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Sallie Mae, Inc., a California-based company that services student loans obtained by some of the plaintiffs for the purpose of attending a culinary program.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that, on July 25, 2012, a federal court granted a motion to quash a business records subpoena seeking electronically stored information pertaining to student loans made to them for attending a Culinary Arts, Inc. culinary school.  According to the complaint, the subpoena was improper because it sought information that was irrelevant and unrelated to the underlying lawsuit and that plaintiffs had already agreed to pay for the reasonable costs of complying with the subpoena.  In its order granting the motion to revoke the subpoena, the court found that the subpoena violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of $11,487, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $25,245.  On August 28, 2013, the trial court granted the motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to comply with the second subpoena, which was also denied by the court.  As set forth in the court order, this order requires defendants to provide reasonable attorney fees and expenses to the parties in compliance with the subpoenas, and requires the parties to pay civil penalties of up to eight full time days of engineering time. The court also granted the defendants' motion for sanctions against the defendants jointly and severally, for filing a frivolous appeal in violation of Section 1563 of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder, and for violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 5 of the Commission on Digital and the Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education Reform Act of 1989 (\"CPEGRA\").  The court's order also requires the defendant to provide a cost estimate for complying with a subpoena that is reasonable and reasonable because it required plaintiffs to produce the requested information in a reasonable format and in a reasonably usable form.  For example, the SEC alleges that the defendant failed to provide an estimate for the cost of producing the requested data and that it failed to prepare a spreadsheet. The SEC also alleges that defendants failed to disclose to the court that they were not required to pay a reasonable cost of production."
