  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment in favor of the city of Pittsburgh's Historic Preservation Commission against Heather Johnson and her husband, Thomas Lemmon, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Pittsburgh, Johnson and Lemmon raised the issue of whether or not to issue a certificate of appropriateness for construction and renovation within the historic district. The complaint alleges that the Commission improperly used the Department of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation to determine whether Johnson's house was compatible with the surrounding row of historic homes.  The complaint further alleges that Johnson did not demonstrate that her house was \"capable of existing together in harmony with the historic fabric of the district.\"  The Commission's final judgment against Johnson, which permanently enjoins her from violating the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office today announced criminal charges against Johnson. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David M. Thompson, Gail Dwyer, Barry Ratliff, Douglas Durfey, and Gwendolyn R. Ricchiute of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Todd Meyer, Patricia Rogers, and Barry Ratlow. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for Allegheny County, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce in this matter."
