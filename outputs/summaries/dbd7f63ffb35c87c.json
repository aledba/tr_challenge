  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that, in 2014, McCarley was stopped by a security guard at a Roth\u2019s grocery store for allegedly stealing a deli item. The SEC alleges that the officer observed that defendant was carrying a backpack and that he had probable cause to arrest her for possession of a controlled substance. The complaint further alleges that he conducted a search of the backpack and found a small black case that he believed could have contained evidence of a drug delivery. The court ruled that the search was lawful because the backpack was impermissibly searched and the officer had reasonable and objective belief that there would be more marijuana found on the item than there was in the search.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Oregon today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed today in federal district court in New York, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of Section 9 of the Exchange Act, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants agreed to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $5,000 each. The defendants also agreed to pay $1,000 in restitution, which is equal to the amount of their civil monetary penalties. The settlements are pending final approval by the court.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, and Ms. Gibson is supervising the case.  An SEC examination that led to the discovery of the alleged drug-related evidence in the case was conducted in the absence of a court order requiring the officer to search the backpack. The investigation was conducted by Scott A. Mascianica and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Oregon Department of Justice in this matter."
