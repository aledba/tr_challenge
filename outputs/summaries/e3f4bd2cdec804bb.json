  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Clay Shelton, who was convicted of wire fraud, money laundering, and securities fraud.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Shelton sold $1.2 million in securities with the promise that the investment would be used to purchase and operate an existing natural gas pipeline in Tennessee. Instead, Shelton allegedly used the money to purchase collateralized mortgage obligations, make payroll at one of his companies, and pay himself a salary.  According to the complaint, the SEC alleges that, as a result of the SEC's findings, the defendants were not adequately instructed on the material facts of the case and Shelton was constitutionally ineffective for failing to seek a good-faith jury instruction for the wire fraud charges.  Shelton also allegedly failed to tell his investors that their money would be held in escrow pending approval of the financing.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants never received the PPM, which Shelton claimed was relevant to the decision to purchase the securities because the money did not stay at AB&T for long.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the court granted the SEC and the defendants a temporary restraining order and ordered Shelton to pay disgorgement of $1,370,000, prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil penalty of $150,000.  On the same day, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi announced criminal charges against Shelton.
