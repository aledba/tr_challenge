  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Pennsylvania today entered final judgments against Nancy Ann Appellant, a Pennsylvania resident who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that, from at least November 2015 through October 2016, Appelleant engaged in a pattern of misconduct that included failing to disclose the names and addresses of three of her alleged victims, including her brother, his sister, and his mother, Kristina Jo Karpinski.  According to the complaint, the defendants were so malnourished that they did not want to feed their brother and sister, despite repeated requests to do so.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that Appelant failed to disclose to the court that her brother had struggled with his health prior to living with her, that she had difficulty dealing with separation from his biological mother, and that she did not tell her brother about his struggles with weight loss.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint against AppelleandKarpinski, the trial court entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and bars her from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of $50,000.  Appelland has also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On November 13, 2017, the court granted a motion for a temporary restraining order and entered a judgment ordering a preliminary injunction against the defendants from further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $7,500, $2,500 and $1,500.  Defendants have also agreed not to participate in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sell of any securities in connection with the alleged misconduct of the defendants, and to pay the civil penalty in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the SEC.  Separately, the SEC announced that it had obtained an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the children, ordering the receiver to provide the receiver with a copy of the receiver's findings, and appointing an independent receiver to supervise the receiver"
