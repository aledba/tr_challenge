  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois on March 29, 2019 entered a final judgment against two former investment advisory clients of Brookstone Capital Management, LLC for breach of fiduciary duty in connection with investments in a mutual fund called \u201cKZSIX.\u201d The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to disclose their conflicts of interest relating to the fund, misrepresented KZSix's susceptibility to market downturns, and transferred the plaintiffs' investments into a fund called the \"Kaizen Hedged Premium Spreads Fund\" without the investors' affirmative and informed consent to do so.  According to the complaint, the defendants also failed to inform the investors that the fund was a lower risk investment because it employed an additional hedging strategy intended to offset losses during market declines.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in DuPage County, Illinois, charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On March 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge William G. Donnelly of the Federal Bureau of Investigation granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Zayed consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge $7,500, and orders the company to pay $2,500 in prejudgment interests, and requires him to pay an $8,500 civil penalty.  Portell has also agreed to the appointment of a receiver to facilitate the transfer of her investments.   The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David J. Folena and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office."
