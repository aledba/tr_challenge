  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against St. George Oil Group, Inc. and its owner and operator, Nagle Station, LLC, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 28, 2014, filed in federal court in Chicago, Illinois, the defendants sought to intervene in an emergency action brought by the Illinois Department of Public Health against the Army Corps of Engineers.  The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to adequately represent their interests in the emergency action and failed to file a motion to intervene.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and requires them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On March 2, 2016, the court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an emergency court order, and ordered the defendants to comply with the court's order.  Last week, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Chicago against Nagle and St.George, alleging that they violated Section 2 of the Environmental Protection Act. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against the Defendants, as well as an officer-and-director bar against each of them. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas in the Chicago Office of the Chief of the Air Quality Management Agency. The examination was conducted in the office of the Illinois Secretary of State's Office, and the case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the FBI's Chicago Field Office and the Illinois State Auditor's Office."
