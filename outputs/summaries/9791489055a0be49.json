  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a default judgment against Bear Communications, LLC, a Kansas-based construction company, for failing to timely respond to a petition filed by former project manager Brett Paes.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson County, Kansas, alleges that Bear Communications violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to respond to Paes's petition.  According to the complaint, Paes was released from employment when the company's work in the Kansas City area was completed, and Paes refused a transfer to Nashville, Tennessee.  Paes' complaint alleges that after Paes filed his complaint, Bear Communications sent Paes a cease-and-desist letter, which contained false statements and fabrications, stating that Paes had accepted service of the petition on May 3, 2017, and that at the end of August 2017, he left the company to file a response to the request.  In a parallel action, the Missouri Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Paes, alleging that he was wrongfully terminated in retaliation for pursuing workers' compensation treatment and benefits.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, requires them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders them to provide a civil penalty of $200,000, which is equal to the amount of their civil monetary penalties, and bars them from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On March 26, 2018, the trial court granted the motion to set aside the default judgment and ordered Bear Communications to comply with the court's order.  Last week, the court issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order requiring Bear Communications' compliance with the agreed-upon settlement to be followed by a hearing on March 28, 2018.  This order requires the court to determine whether to issue an order permanently enjoining Bear Communications from violating the charged provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and requires it to provide an accounting of all of the defendants' actions in connection with the default judgments.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Feb. 13, 2019).  The Court also issued an Order appointing a receiver to oversee the response of any pending litigation.
