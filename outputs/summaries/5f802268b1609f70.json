  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Shreveport, Louisiana man accused of setting a van on fire.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in New Orleans, Linzell Jones was convicted of aggravated arson and sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment at hard labor, suspended, with the first 2 years to be served without benefits.  The SEC alleges that Jones began drinking alcohol and would become erratic behind closed doors.  On March 9, 2016, the trial court found that Jones was competent to stand trial for aggravated arson.  Jones allegedly told his wife that he would \"burn down all these s**t of b****** house around these homes even this house right here\" and \"let me do the work.\"  The complaint further alleges that he lit a barbeque grill under the carport and told her that he had lit a grill in the backyard.  As alleged in the complaint, Jones's wife, who has now divorced Jones, was furious because she did not receive enough insurance proceeds to cover the full extent of the damage caused by the fire, and he threatened to burn down their house.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, Jones consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Louisiana today entered final judgments against Jones, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against himself and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.   The court also issued an order suspending Jones from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert in arson investigation.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1160."
