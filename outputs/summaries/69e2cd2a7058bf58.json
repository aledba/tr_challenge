  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against Jonathan Rose, Jr., a Maryland resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Montgomery County, Maryland, alleges that, beginning in 2013, Jonathan Rose and his wife, Andrea Rose, raised the issue of whether Jonathan should be entitled to a share of child support based on the amount of overnights he received as a result of his divorce from Andrea Rose.  According to the complaint, the court found that Jonathan did not actually keep the children for more than 35% of the overnings as required by the federal law, and that he owed Andrea $18,612.37 in shared expenses related to the children.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court improperly precluded Jonathan from testifying on the basis that he had not kept the children, despite repeated requests to do so.  Finally, the SEC alleges that Jonathan failed to comply with pre-trial discovery requests directed to him by the court, and the court granted Jonathan's motion for summary judgment against him.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Jonathan has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay $19,078.71 in disgorgement, $18.612.36 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $20,076.71.  On December 31, 2019, the Court granted Jonathan a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply as an officer or director of a public company, and requires him to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court.  For further information, see Litman v. Litman, 206 Md. App. 542, 582 (2010).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jonathan.
