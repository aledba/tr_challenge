  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans today entered a final judgment in favor of a medical malpractice action brought by Felicia West, her father, Anthony Smith, and four other health care providers in connection with her death.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, West suffered a seizure on October 10, 2012, after suffering a seizure at her residence. The complaint alleges that Dr. Milton Seiler caused the woman's death by causing her to have a large intracranial hemorrhage.  The complaint further alleges that the Mississippi Medical Malpractice Act (MMA) requires that all defendants be entitled to a $500,000.00 cap on damages, regardless of any potential for reduction under the MMA.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against the remaining health care defendants for their roles in the West's death. The SEC's Complaint and Request for Formation of Medical Review Panel (MRP) charged West with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, West consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of her ill-gotten gains plus interest and costs. The settlement is subject to approval by the court.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the Court of Appeals granted the Commission's motion for summary judgment and ordered the Commission to determine whether to proceed with a trial on the merits of the case against West. The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kelly L. Gibson, John Rymas, and Eric R. Werner of the New Orleans Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Werner. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.
