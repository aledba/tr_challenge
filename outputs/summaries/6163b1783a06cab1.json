  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the University of South Carolina and two student groups for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charleston, South Carolina, on November 23, 2015, the defendants raised the issue of whether or not the university violated the First Amendment by failing to conduct an independent investigation into student complaints about the Free Speech Event.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the university did not have any reasonable expectation that the complaints would be deemed serious enough to warrant an enforcement action.  In fact, according to the complaint, the complaint alleges, the University's response to student complaints was so severe and intrusive that it required Abbott to attend a meeting with Wells to determine whether he had reasonable cause to believe that he had engaged in a reasonable response to the complaints.  As a result, Abbott and the other defendants were unable to establish a credible threat of enforcement of the university\u2019s policy, which prohibits students from participating in any type of free speech event.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Abbott, the College Libertarians, and Young Americans for Liberty have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering Abbott to comply with the court order, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  Abbott also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public university for five years, and to pay disgorgement of $2,500, plus prejudgment interest of $100,000, plus a $50,000 civil penalty.  Finally, Abbott has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of federal law, and that he will pay a $1.5 million civil penalty in the amount of $75,000 and a $25,000 officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Student Conduct, and the College of Education and the Department of Justice in this matter."
