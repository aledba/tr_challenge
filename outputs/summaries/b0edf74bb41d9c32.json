  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant in a child custody case against him.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that Randolph Scott Pepke Jr. and Maria Gandul violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Ponzi-like tactics were used to manipulate the children into believing that they were in the best interests of their biological mother and foster families. In reality, according to the complaint, the children were in DCF's custody and under CFCE's supervision when, in fact, they were not in the agency's custody at the time of the dependency proceedings. In addition, the complaint alleges that Caroll was a client relations coordinator working for DCF, and Gandul was a quality management manager working for the agency. The SEC alleges that the defendants failed to investigate or properly convey vital information to the dependency court judges so that they could make decisions in the \"best interests of the children.\" The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order and an order temporarily freezing the children's assets. The court granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction, ordered a permanent injunction, and issued an order freezing the assets of the defendants. The order also temporarily enjoins the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court also granted the court's motion for an asset freeze and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  On May 19, 2018, a federal district court in Orlando, Florida entered an order granting the defendants preliminary and permanent injunctions against future violations, ordering the destruction of any evidence, and ordering the forfeiture of any assets or any other relief sought by the defendant. The Court granted the defendants' request for an emergency court order and ordered that the court consider the merits of the relief sought in the complaint. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson under the supervision of Amy C. Welshhans. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Florida Department of Children and Families, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Office of Child Advocacy and Advocacy."
