  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former dispatcher who was found liable for a long-running history of post-traumatic stress disorder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Coos County, Texas, on May 5, 2016, Judge Timothy J. Mascianica found that, contrary to the board's order, the former dispatcher had failed to adequately account for her work stressors in determining the cause of her PTSD.  The complaint further alleges that, despite having been trained as a 9-1-1 dispatcher, Reagan failed to properly account for the stressors that caused her to experience in her work as a dispatcher.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the board improperly discounted Reagan's opinion for failing to fully account for nonwork-related stressors, such as stressors related to her husband's illness.   The SEC's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins Reagan from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Texas Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
