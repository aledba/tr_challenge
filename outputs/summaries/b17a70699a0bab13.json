  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against El Dorado County District Attorney Brian R. Basinger in favor of a temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Sacramento, from 2011 through 2013, Basingter and Basingler violated Section 366.26 of the federal securities laws by failing to determine whether or not to terminate parental rights and placing the minors in long-term foster care.  The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to participate in voluntary family maintenance offered by the court and failed to show that termination of parental rights would be detrimental to the children.  In addition, the complaint alleges the defendants did not engage in any meaningful sibling or parental bond interaction with the baby and did not participate in the voluntary and court-ordered services offered in the child's case.  As a result, the court terminated the parental rights of the two minors, who were placed in the same home with K.R. and I.R., without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  On May 24, 2013, the SEC issued an order requiring the defendants to comply with the court's order by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal, state, and local securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000.  Bribing the judge will determine the amount of restitution to be paid in the civil penalty.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 13-cv-01-17.  Separately, the Department of Health and Human Services today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order temporarily restraining the defendants from destroying evidence in connection with the pending litigation.  A hearing scheduled for May 26, 2013 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Children and Family Education. The SEC's litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Blau.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Department of Child and Family Services."
