  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Ohio today entered final judgments against Karvo Paving Co., a company that does most of its work for the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that the Ohio Secretary of State's Office improperly concluded that Karvo did not have to pay tax on the traffic maintenance equipment it provided while performing ODOT contracts, the employment services it provided to Karvo, and the equipment it rented from K&H Excavating, LLC.  According to the complaint, Karvo rented the equipment to ODOT for the period of January 1, 2008, to provide maintenance services while performing contracts for the state.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the equipment was leased by Karvo for the purpose of providing and maintaining ODOT services during the construction projects.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that after Karvo purchased the equipment, it leased it to the company for the duration of the contracts.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the Board incorrectly concluded that, because Karvo was effectively leasing the equipment while performing the contracts, it did not qualify as a \"lease\" under Section 5739.02(B)(8) of the federal tax code.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission&rsquo;s complaint, the Commissioner has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 5b-5 and 5c-8 thereunder, and orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and a $10,000 officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Office of Inspector General in this matter."
