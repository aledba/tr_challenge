  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Daederick Lacy, Jr., who was convicted on three counts of sex-trafficking and sentenced to a total of 293 months of imprisonment.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that Lacy violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1591 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Lacy consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Texas today announced criminal charges against Lacy.  Lacy agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  On December 6, 2015, the jury found Lacy guilty on all three counts, and he was sentenced to 293 months in prison.  After a hearing on December 7, 2016, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against him, and ordered him to surrender his passport and other personal information.  To settle the case, he also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to be barred from soliciting or serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  As part of the settlement, he agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions, to be restrained from associating with any third party, and to pay an officer and director bar in the future.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-cv-17-2014. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice."
