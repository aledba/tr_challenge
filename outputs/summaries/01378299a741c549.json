  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the City of Chicago in a civil rights case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that former city attorney Jordan Marsh violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Marsh was for years involved in defending the city against claims that it failed to train, supervise, discipline, and investigate its officers; covered up officers' excessive force; and permitted its officers to observe a \"code of silence,\" meaning that officers covered up one another's misconduct.  Marsh also had direct access to the CIT program documents and personnel as part of his work as a supervisor in the city's Corporation Counsel's Office.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Marsh.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Marsh consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, prejudgment interest of $2,038.81, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The court's order also prohibits Marsh from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a result of his prior employment as a municipal attorney. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and supervised by Marc Blau of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Office of Inspector General, and the Chicago Field Office of the Department of Justice in this matter."
