  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered default judgments against Iran for its role in the 1983 and 1984 embassy bombings in Beirut, Lebanon.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., alleges that the court improperly granted default judgments in the two instant cases against Iran.  According to the complaint, the court's order was issued on the basis of preliminary and permanent injunctions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Iran in connection with the same two instant actions.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the Court's order violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Complaint or in the case of the other instant actions, the defendants consented to the entry of default judgments that are subject to the federal court's jurisdiction.  For example, the SEC previously granted default judgment motions against the defendants in two instant action actions, in which the court found that Iran was liable for the victims of the 1983 embassy bombings and that it was liable to pay civil penalties in the future.  On the other hand, the complaint alleges that, in the earlier action, Iran was not immune from default judgments because it had eliminated sovereign immunity from certain actions in the past.  Among other things, the case was investigated by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice's Cyber Unit, which conducted a parallel examination of the case. The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Cyber Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom's Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the U.K. Secret Service, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, and the Swiss Federal Office of Justice and Internal Revenue Service in this matter."
