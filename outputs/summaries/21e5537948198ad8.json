  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment ordering the restitution of more than $7,500 to a victim of child pornography.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 2009, a federal district court in the District of Columbia issued an order requiring defendants to pay restitution in the amount of their victims\u2019 losses.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Monzel falsely claimed that the court had found that the defendant possessed only one single image of Amy, and that he was responsible for her losses. The complaint further alleges that Monzel had access to a collection of images of Amy that he used to create the false appearance of Amy in her images.  Monzel also allegedly used the images to groom other victims for sexual exploitation.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the court did not consider Monzel as a sufficient cause to award restitution.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the district court simply failed to consider the relative causal role of Monzel in determining the amount and severity of the restitution award.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the Court held that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also ordered Monzel to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Monzel.  On January 24, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling and offering them investment advice by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC Investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel administrative proceeding, the SEC filed an enforcement action on January 26, 2019.  Among other things, the case was investigated by the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, which conducted an examination of alleged child pornography violations. The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Eric R. Kasper and supervised by Amy S. Cotter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the U."
