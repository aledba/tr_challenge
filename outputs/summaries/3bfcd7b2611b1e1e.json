  "summary": "On February 20, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment in favor of the California Department of Health and Safety' motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, California, alleges that the state of California has a significant interest in protecting its citizens and informing them of possible health risks.  According to the complaint, the state is required to publish a list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer based on the finding of one organization (which as noted above, only found that substance is probably carcinogenic).  The complaint alleges that California has failed to provide a clear and reasonable warning to anyone exposed to glyphosate, even if the organization found no evidence that it caused cancer.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the First Amendment, and orders them to pay $2,500 per day in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $3,500.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On February 21, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a temporary restraining order, an injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendant, against whom the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, an officer and director bar, and other emergency relief.  To learn more about the federal government's obligations under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, see Litigation Release No. 563 (9th Cir. 2014).  In its order, the court also issued an order requiring the defendants to provide an adequate warning about the potential health risks posed by glyphosate, including cancer, to the public.  It also ordered the companies to pay a $1,500 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer anddirector bar.
