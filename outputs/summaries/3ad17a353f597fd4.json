  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia today entered a final judgment in favor of Royal SMIT Transformers B.V., a company based in the Netherlands that manufactures large power transformers.  According to the court's order, in 2015, Royal sold three of its transformers to Entergy Louisiana, LLC, for use at one of its substations in St. Gabriel, Louisiana.  The court found that the carriers were not bound by the Himalaya Clause in the bill of lading, and that they could not be held liable for any liability arising from their actions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Royal.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Royal with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Royal consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,600,000.  Royal has also agreed to a settlement where it will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in any future federal securities law. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  This case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
