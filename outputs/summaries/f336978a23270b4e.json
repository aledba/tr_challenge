  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment in favor of a Texas resident who was charged with defrauding a trial court in an automobile accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that Leticia C. Garcia filed a bill of review in August 2016 to set aside a default judgment against Preston R. Ennis, alleging that he failed to serve her in strict compliance with the rules governing service of process, rendering the default judgment void for want of personal jurisdiction. The court granted the motion for summary judgment on the basis of the court's finding that Garcia violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Ennis violated Section 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(3) of Exchange Act Rules 10b2-1 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Garcia consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $171,852.57. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Garcia.

On January 4, 2019, Judge McCole issued a preliminary injunction against Ennis and ordered him to comply with the court\u2019s order. The same day, the court denied the request for an emergency court order and issued a partial order suspending Ennis from appearing or practicing before the court as a matter of law. The order also ordered Ennis to submit a written memorandum of waiver, which is required by federal law, to show that he complied with the pre-judgment requirements of Rule 107(a) and that he had followed those requirements. The judge also ordered that the clerk retain a copy of the late-filed citation, which was missing from the record when the court issued its default judgment. The complaint also requested that the trial court consider the merits of the case before it issued its final judgment, including whether it was reasonable to believe that the defendant was properly served with the citation. The trial court denied Ennis\u2019 motion for a permanent injunction and ordered"
