  "summary": "On March 28, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania woman for her role in an alleged child abuse case.  The court entered the final judgment on May 7, 2018, that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 4 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia on March 29, 2019 and unsealed on May 8, 2018 in federal District Court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Department of Health and Human Services issued indicated reports of child abuse against both parents because their two-month-old son suffered from \"Shaken Baby Syndrome.\"  The SEC alleges that, based on the facts recited in the founded reports, the mother was entitled to an evidentiary hearing based solely on her entry into the program.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the filed reports, Mother consented to the entry of an order that permanently restrains the records of the court and requires the court to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant an administrative hearing.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Mother for her roles in the alleged child-abuse case. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by the Office of Inspector General's Criminal Justice Unit and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
