  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Suffolk Asphalt Supply, Inc. (\"Suffolk\"), a real estate investment company based in Westhampton Beach, N.Y.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Buffalo, New York, on June 11, 2007, Suffolk filed a civil injunctive action against the company for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to overcome the presumption that the property owner had recouped its investment in the nonconforming asphalt plant and avoided substantial financial loss.  In its judgment, the court found that, in determining whether a property owner has been able to recoup its investment, the company should consider whether the amount of its investment was reasonable and, thus, constitutional as to whether it has sustained its investment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Suffolk consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the company from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  On May 19, 2005, the Board of Trustees of the Village of Buffalo granted the company's request for an amortization period to be extended to five years from the date it originally intended to end the plant's operations.  As part of the settlement, which is subject to court approval, Suffolk agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), as well as to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, offer and sale of any security, offer or offer of any securities, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil monetary penalty, a penny stock bar, and an officer-and-director bar.  Separately, the Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order against Suffolk, ordering the company to comply with the court's order that it cease and desist from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordering it to provide a copy of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Rules of Conduct for the next five years.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office."
