  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of The New York and Presbyterian Hospital (NYCHRL) in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, New York, alleges that, in April 2015, the hospital terminated twelve employees for age-related violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the hospital failed to disclose to the jury that it had conducted an investigation into the alleged age discrimination that resulted in the termination of twelve employees.  According to the complaint, the investigation was conducted by staff members, including Diane Mand, a technical chemistry supervisor at the hospital, and was supervised by Naeem U. Qureshi, a clinical trial supervisor. The SEC alleges that Mand was not involved in the investigation, and that she did not participate in the decision to fire the employees. Rather, the complaint alleges that she conducted the investigation by reviewing screenshots of the hospital's computer system showing non-critical test results, which could have led her to conclude that the employees had engaged in a hostile work environment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Mand. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Mand, and ordered her to pay a civil penalty of $250,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Mand consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") as well as a conduct-based injunction, which prohibits her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with a complaint of age discrimination. The judgment also orders the hospital to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000 and $2,500, respectively.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson, Ms. Thompson, and Mr. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Ansu Banerjee of the Boston Regional Office, with the assistance of John Rymas of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and the Office of Compliance."
