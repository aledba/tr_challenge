  "summary": "On January 17, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a final judgment against Peter Gotti, the former Acting Boss of the Gambino Crime Family of La Cosa Nostra, for his role in extorting the construction industry. The Honorable Richard C. Casey sentenced Gotti to 300 months imprisonment, to be served consecutive to a 112-month sentence Gotti was then serving for securities fraud and for conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering. Gotti consented to the final judgment without admitting or denying the findings of the court. The final judgment permanently enjoins Gotti from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 3553(a) of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar. The court also ordered Gotti's release from prison on a compassionate basis.  The court's order against Gotti also prohibits him from associating with any third party, including a registered representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (BOP). Gotti has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains his sentence from 300 months to 112 months. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's New York office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban, Chief of the Criminal Investigations Division.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
