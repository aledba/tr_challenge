  "summary": "On July 8, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of New York entered a final judgment against the State Department and the Department of Defense in an emergency action related to the Khashoggi case.  The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered that the Department and Department of State process 5,000 pages per month of documents responsive to an emergency request by the United States Department of Justice for the release of the missing journalist's body. The court also granted the request for expedited processing of the requested documents.  According to the court's order, the agency had identified 22,637 pages of potentially responsive records that would ultimately need to be processed.  As alleged in the court order, however, this was insufficient for the agency to process all of these requests at a reasonable pace.  In its final judgment, the court found that the agency could not meet the requested processing rate.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the government consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering it to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges the agency with violating the federal securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The complaint also names as a relief defendant the Office of Information Counsel (OIC) which administers the agency's FOIA requests.  OIC is being audited by the SEC as part of its Office of Inspector General's Office, which is conducting a related examination of the case. The litigation will be led by Colby Itkowitz and Karoun Demirjian and supervised by Jennifer Chun Barry. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, U.K. Attorney's Office for the Middle East, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
