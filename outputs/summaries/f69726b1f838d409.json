  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former supervisor of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Michael Ioane, Sr., a convicted felon who was under investigation for criminal tax fraud and conspiracy, conducted a search warrant at his home on June 8, 2006. According to the complaint, the agents entered the home bathroom and conducted a quick search of the interior of the home. The complaint alleges that Shelly asked the agents to remove her clothing so that she could make sure Shelly did not hide anything, and that the agents did not check the bathroom for weapons.  Shelly, who was wearing a long sundress and a long skirt, complied with the agents' request to remain in the bathroom.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Ioane.  On May 9, 2011, the U.N. Office of Inspector General issued an order suspending the conduct of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division, including the search of Shelly's home, and ordering the agency to conduct a background check on the home of the officer conducting the search.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Ioane consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Sepulveda, a federal district court in Miami, Florida, entered a judgment ordering the SEC to determine whether the conduct was unreasonable and that it was reasonable to proceed with a qualified immunity proceeding. The court also ordered the FBI to conduct an independent examination of the background of the individual conducting the investigation.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Eric Werner of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The SEC examination was conducted in the office of Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Werner. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Scott A. Kasper, David A. Schiff, and Amy C. Welshhans of the Boston Regional Office."
