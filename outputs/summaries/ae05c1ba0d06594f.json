  "summary": "On January 4, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi entered a final judgment in favor of a Biloxi, Mississippi Walgreens Co. (Walgreens) and CBRE Group, Inc. (CBRE) for gross negligence for injuries sustained, including the amputation of his left leg, when an errant third-party driver pulled into a nose-in parking space in front of where O'Bryant stood, caused his truck to lurch over the curb, and pinned O\u2019bryant to the exterior wall of the store.  The court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on February 5, 2019, and entered a default judgment against them on March 4, 2019.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, on February 27, 2015, a Walgreen Co. employee was injured in an automobile accident when a car drove into the parking space.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants had breached their duty to make the premises reasonably safe for all of their customers by failing to erect vertical bollards, parking stops, and other safety barriers to prevent the driver from jumping the curb and causing his injuries.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director and penny stock bars.  Additionally, the judgment orders the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and requires the company to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in the amount of $1,500.  O'Brien has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws, and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a public company.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mississippi State Attorney General's Office, and the Mississippi Department of Insurance in this matter."
