  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Tzvee Rotberg, a New York resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 21, 2016, Rotberg alleges that he received a series of text messages from JAB Communications, Inc. and Vibes Media, LLC, which he alleges were sent to him by JAB without his knowledge or consent.  The complaint alleges that the defendants used an automated telephone dialing system (ATDS) to send the messages, and that they called Rotberg on his cell phone.  Rotberg allegedly received the text messages after receiving them.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the ATDS is not telemarketer-like, and the defendants did not use an ATDS to receive the messages.  In fact, the SEC alleges that Rotberg received at least one of those text messages in violation of Section 12(b)(6) of the Telecommunications Act of 1933, which prohibits telemarketers from using any automated telephone system.    The SEC's Complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Rotberg with violating Sections 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d).  The Complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, JAB has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $500,000.  JAB's settlement is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant.gov website to quickly and easily identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Postal Inspection Service and the Federal Insurance Regulatory Surveillance Authority."
