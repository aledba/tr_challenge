  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Bashar Ahmedo, a San Diego resident, ordering him to pay $12,655 in attorney fees.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 30, 2013, Ahmedo and his girlfriend, Sina Faton, were in a relationship for about two years when they filed a DVRO request for a temporary restraining order against Ahmedo.  As alleged in the complaint, the court granted the attorney fees to Faton on the basis of a pre-determined date and time.  The complaint further alleges that Faton failed to file an attorney fees request before the date of the hearing, and instead waited until after the hearing to file a response.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Ahmedo failed to respond to the court's order to award the fees because he did not have the financial resources to do so.  On March 24, 2014, a federal district court in San Diego issued an order requiring Faton to pay attorney fees pursuant to the pre-DVRO order.

At the hearing that same day, the district court issued a second order granting Faton a one-year attorney fees award, which is unrelated to the earlier court order that had been issued.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, as well as in the Complaint filed in federal court in New York, the Court granted the court-ordered attorney fees order and ordered Faton disgorgement with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against her.  Finally, on August 14, 2013 a federal judge granted Faton the right to request attorney fees after adjudication of the second DVRo request.  Two days later, the same judge granted the same amount of attorney fees for Faton.  A court hearing on August 16, 2013 was scheduled for 3:30 p.m. The court granted a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the court to issue an order permanently enjoining Faton from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering her to comply with the court order, and ordering the issuance of an attorney fee.   The court also denied the request for an officer and director bar against Faton and ordered her to pay a $5,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The court denied the motion for an injunction, and the court"
