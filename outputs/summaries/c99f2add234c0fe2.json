  "summary": "On March 21, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Arkansas entered a final judgment against Tiffany Chandler-Sivage, a mother of two who was incarcerated for drug and alcohol abuse.  The court found that Chandler violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered her to comply with the court's order to terminate her parental rights.  According to the court order, the mother was previously in drug court for serious drug charges and had been incarcerated for them.  As alleged in the complaint, she was previously incarcerated for felony drug possession and had a prior history of drug use and incarceration.  In addition, according to the order, Chandler had spent three-and-a-half or four years in a drug court program that's typically a two-year program.  She went to the regional correctional facility where she received drug treatment during that time.  While she was there, she allegedly engaged in criminal behavior and exposed the children to domestic violence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Chandler consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from violating the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000 and bars her from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years. The court also granted the mother's motion for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits her from participating in the placement of children under the age of 12, and from making any decisions regarding the permanency of the children.  On March 24, 2018, the court entered an order requiring the court to consider the merits of the case against the mother, finding that she had made sufficient progress in solving her drug problems and to achieve sobriety, that she was not a threat to the children, and that the court had provided reasonable assistance in finding a reasonable basis for her termination.  At a hearing on March 26, 2019, the judge granted the family's request for an emergency court order and ordered that the family be placed in the custody of a relative or a friend of the relative who lives across the street from where the children are being placed.  After the family was placed in DHS's emergency custody, Chandler was arrested on drug charges.  During her incarceration, Chandler allegedly used prescription medication that was not prescribed to her by her mother.  When she was released from prison in October 2015, she had a history of substance-abuse and drug use, and she continued to use prescription medication.  Chandler has been incarcerated since August 2016.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing,"
