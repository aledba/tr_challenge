  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against a Michigan-based company for failing to comply with a court order granting rate relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed on April 12, 2018, alleges that the Public Service Commission (PSC) improperly imposed a two-week delay in approving rate relief for a company that failed to meet its obligations under the federal and state constitutions.  According to the complaint, the PSC's order, which was issued on May 15, 2017, required that the company pay a $49,895,000 penalty in the amount of $51,700,000, which would be offset by a $1.9 million shortfall in revenue for the company.  In addition, the order required the company to apply a \"net CONE\" methodology to calculate the capacity costs that it was entitled to recover, including costs that were not recoverable by means of a capacity charge.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $1,945,000.  Additionally, the court granted the company a temporary restraining order against further violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.   The court also issued an order temporarily restraining the company from issuing or selling any new electricity, and ordering it to pay an $80,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, and the Michigan Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 462.25 (March 22, 2018)."
