  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 16, 2018, entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Brooklyn, alleges that the federal government failed to enforce a provision of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974. The complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Secretary of Health and Human Services failed to adequately enforce the federal right to foster care maintenance payments.  According to the complaint, the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General had previously issued an order requiring states to make certain payments to foster parents.  In its order, the court found that the Secretary lacked the authority to enforce the provision of Section 1983.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, and from violating Section 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. The court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 22, 2018).  The case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Advocacy and Public Education. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the Inspector General in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC thanks the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for its assistance in the matter."
