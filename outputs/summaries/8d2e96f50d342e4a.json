  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the agency that administers the federal agency employee rights to direct employees and assign work.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on April 10, 2016, the agency violated the agency\u2019s right to determine the number of performance rating levels for its employees.  The complaint alleges that the agency had no duty to bargain, and that, in appraising employee work performance, it failed to determine whether an employee was performing at or above the required number of rating levels.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that, as a result of its failure to bargain with the agency, it was unable to determine how many rating levels to include in a performance appraisal system.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the agency from violating these provisions, and orders the agency to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the U.N. Office of Personnel Management in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Department of Homeland Security today announced criminal charges against a former employee of the agency for his or her participation in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the agency rating system. The complaint also charges the agency with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On May 3, 2016 the SEC filed a complaint in the United Kingdom District Court against the U of S. Attorney for New Jersey, alleging that the SEC violated Section 17(a)(2)(A) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  To settle the SEC case, the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order, ordered an accounting, and issued an officer-and-director bar"
