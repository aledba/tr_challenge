  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Texas-based pulmonologist who has agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that Dr. Alex Lechin and Derek Riebau violated the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to timely serve an expert report.  According to the complaint, in August 2015, Perry presented to the emergency room complaining of weakness in his left leg, difficulty walking, and poor balance.  In a pre-discovery expert report, the experts opined that the patient had an abscess on his spinal cord that was growing and causing permanent paralysis.  As alleged, the expert report was inadequate because it failed to identify when the patient's abscess had grown and damaged his spine, or how and why it caused the patient to lose his ability to walk.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Perry consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization for five years.  On August 24, 2016, the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment against Puppala, finding that the expert reports were inadequate in providing a fair summary of the experts' opinions regarding causation and a basis for a motion to dismiss.  Puppala also agreed to a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 74.351 of the Exchange Act and Rules 75-351-2 and 75-4 thereunder, and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged breach.  To settle the case, the court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties to be determined by the court at a later date.
