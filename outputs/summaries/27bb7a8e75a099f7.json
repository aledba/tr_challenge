  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a California-based insurance company and its former president for defrauding investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that, in 2010, IAS, a Texas-based company owned and operated by Larry C. Buckley, made various representations regarding the strength of his company\u2019s business, including that it was likely to grow, and that it would not be forced to pay any severance.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2011, Buckley and IAS entered into a non-disclosure agreement in which they each agreed not to violate the terms of the agreement and to pay $296,091.72 in severance pay.  As alleged in the complaint, this agreement did not guarantee any particular amount of business and that IAS could terminate the contract for any reason with 45 days\u2019 notice.  According to the SEC, however, the defendants failed to disclose to IAS that, based on these representations, they did not have the cash on hand to make the second annual payment owed to Buckley on the $1.2 million note.  IAS ultimately terminated Buckley in early 2014, taking the position that the failure to comply with the agreed-upon obligations under the agreement would not result in a conflict with or breach of any other contract.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the parties agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering IAS to pay disgorgement of $1,078.72, prejudgment interest of $296.091, and a civil penalty of $250,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 565 F.3d (5th Cir. 2009).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant a provision of the federal securities laws that requires a court to determine whether a defendant has a right to a penny stock bar.
