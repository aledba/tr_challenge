  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Chicago Title Company, Inc., a California-based real estate developer, for failing to properly record the sale of a real estate property.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in La Quinta, California, alleges that Chicago Title violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, in 2007, First Heritage Bank, N.A. (First Heritage) purchased the property with the intention of developing it into a residential real estate project. After receiving some, but not all, of the loan funds, the trustee conducted a trustee\u2019s sale improperly in various respects, including by failing to tender any amount to Chicago Title and by accepting a purported \"credit bid\" that in fact amounted to giving the property to Rescon \"literally \"for free.\"  The complaint also alleges that the trustee failed to timely record the credit bid made by First Heritage, even though there was an \"unfunded balance\" on the loan.

On March 4, 2020, the court entered an order suspending the asset freeze, freezing the assets of the trustee, and appointing a receiver to oversee the foreclosure of the property. The court also granted a temporary restraining order against the trustee from further violations of the anti-fraud provisions, ordering the receiver to provide a copy of the deed of trust to the receiver, and imposing civil penalties against the receiver.   The court's order also prohibits the receiver from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer and from making any recommendations to the trustee or trustee concerning how to proceed with the foreclosure.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 4, 2015).  The Court of Appeal also issued an order requiring the receiver and trustee to comply with certain pre-judgment requirements, including: (i) requiring a trustee to show reasonable possibility that the borrower had performed its responsibilities under the power of trust; (ii) requiring"
