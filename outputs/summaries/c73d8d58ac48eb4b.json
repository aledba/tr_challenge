  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas on June 21, 2013, entered a final judgment against Patrick J. Stacks, a former deputy sheriff with the Burnet County Sheriff's Office, that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1701.452 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that Stacks omitted crucial details from an offense report and probable cause affidavit describing his arrest of Chance Paul Tendick, which rendered both documents misleading.  According to the complaint, Stacks was not entitled to a discharge for untruthfulness, and instead was entitled to receive a dishonorable discharge.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed an administrative proceeding against Stacks in which it will seek a permanent injunction, an officer-and-officer bar, and a civil injunctive relief order.  On June 20, 2018, the SEC filed an Administrative Procedure Act action, charging Stacks with violating the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, Stack consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining him from future violations of the securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty.  Stacks also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a penny stock and a broker-dealer bar.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Texas State Bd. of Exam'rs of Marriage & Family Therapists v. Staff, 511 S.W.3d 28, 35 (Tex. 2017).  The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson, Ms. Gibson, and Ms. Thompson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Office of Inspector General in this matter."
