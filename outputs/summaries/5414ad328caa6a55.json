  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Oklahoma yesterday entered a final judgment against three former teachers for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Tulsa, Oklahoma, alleges that Jeff Pritchard and three other former teachers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the former teachers were included on a slate of teachers recommended by the Board of Education in 2015-16 that included them. The complaint alleges that none of the teachers had ever had any complaints against the Board, and that the Board did not consider rehiring them because they were not covered by the TDPA.  In addition, the complaint alleges the Board members were aware of Ms. Campbell\u2019s support for the bond issue, but did not vote to rehire her because she had supported students who had protested in favor of a school bond issue.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their civil penalties. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 563, 574, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 1327, (10th Cir. 2014).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the teachers.  On May 24, 2015, the Honorable Judge Timothy M. McCole granted the Teachers\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order, ordered the teachers to return to class, and ordered the district court to determine whether to impose a civil injunctive relief order. The court also issued an order suspending the teachers from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review of the matter.  A hearing for the teachers on June 11, 2015 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern. The hearing was conducted in the absence of any evidence that the teachers were harmed by the conduct of the Board Members. The litigation will be led by Amie Rose Colclazier, Jack Cadenhead, and Mickey Upton. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Oklahoma Department of Education and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
