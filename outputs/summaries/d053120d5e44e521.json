  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Bernard \"Bernie\" Ebbers, the former CEO of WorldCom, Inc., on a motion for compassionate release.  According to the court's order, in 2005, Ebbers was sentenced to 25 years in prison for securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud.  The court found that Ebbers had directed WorldCom to manipulate and publicly report inflated financial results, hiding WorldCom's true financial condition in order to meet securities analysts' expectations.  As alleged in the complaint, when Ebbers and his co-conspirators' fraud came to light in June 2002, the stock price dropped more than 90 percent, and numerous shareholders and former employees lost their savings, medical benefits, retirement funds, and jobs.  In August 2019, the court granted Ebbers's request for a compassionate release, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, for a sentence reduction of 30 years to life imprisonment.  Ebbers has consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  On December 18, 2020, the Court granted the request for an expedited hearing for Ebbers in which it will consider the merits of Ebbers' motion and determine whether to impose a penalty.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael E. Horowitz and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Graham Loomis and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
