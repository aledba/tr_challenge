  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a rail-to-trails case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that defendants failed to disclose that the right-of-way had been abandoned by another railroad, and that the railroad had abandoned its interest in it.  According to the complaint, the defendants' actions violated the federal securities laws, and the defendants sought a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On January 10, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a preliminary injunction, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against defendants, and a conduct-based injunction against defendants from further violations of the securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions, ordering the defendants to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the issuance of an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's receiver. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2018).  The Commission's complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 5 and Rule 5 thereunder, and seeks an injunction against future violations. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Alabama Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the Alabama Office of Inspector General. The case is being handled by Scott A. Thompson, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and John R. Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson and supervised by Ms. Thompson."
