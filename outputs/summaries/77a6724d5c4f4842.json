  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas on October 27, 2016 entered a final judgment against the Gulledges, who were permanently enjoined from building a second-story boathouse on their property.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, Robert and Diana Gulledge purchased their homes on Blue Point Road, a waterfront community in Clear Lake Shores, in 2011. The complaint alleges that they purchased their properties because they knew that the area was prime for yachts and other boats, and that the neighborhood was particularly attractive to homeowners who could watch local boat parades and events from their homes.  The complaint further alleges that, in addition to being able to see passing ships and boats entering and exiting the neighborhood, the defendants were required to show prospective buyers the potential to build larger boathouses in the neighborhood.  In a parallel action, on October 26, 2016, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgements of $1,078, which represents prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,098, and a civil penalty of $500,000.  On October 26th, the court granted the Defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, and granted the defendants' request for an asset freeze and other emergency relief. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Fort Worth Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Office of Inspector General."
