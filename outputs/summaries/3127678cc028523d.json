  "summary": "On September 9, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania-based juvenile court for improperly imposing out-of-home placement on a juvenile delinquent.  The court found that D.W. violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Pittsburgh on June 12, 2019 and unsealed on June 19, 2020, the court issued an order requiring the court to determine whether to impose an order imposing an order that imposes an order on an individual or a group of individuals to be placed in a residential placement.  As alleged in the court order, however, the order did not consider the individual's history with gun violence, his drug and alcohol history, his family involvement with CYF, and the consequences of the juvenile's unsettling behavior on the community.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Department of Justice today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order to expedite the issuance of an order enforcing the federal securities laws, including an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, and ordering the receiver to conduct a background check on the receiver.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the order, the receiver has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar from serving as an officer or director of a public school.  On June 20, 2019 the court granted the receiver's request for an expedited review of the out of home placement order, which is subject to court approval.  A hearing on June 24, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. Eastern.   The hearing was conducted by T.J. Welshhans, and supervised by Mary Zorn, both of the Philadelphia Regional Office.  Ms. Zorn is supervising the case.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1770 (June 12, 2020).
