  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that, from at least March 3, 2016 through March 4, 2016, the defendants entered the defendant\u2019s room and searched the room. The court found that, contrary to what the defendants\u2019 mother told them, the search was unauthorized because the defendant had exclusive control over his room and had a reasonable expectation of privacy from his mother. According to the complaint, the defendant also had access to a guitar case and journal, which the court found to be the property of another co-inhabitant. The complaint further alleges that the defendant did not consent to the search of his room, his guitar case, and his journal, and that his mother did not have any authority to search his room. In addition, the complaint alleges that when the defendant was on probation for conduct unrelated to a school shooting, his mother had the right to search the room and to check the contents of the items in her possession. The SEC also alleges that in one of the searches, a woman entered a bedroom and asked her mother to clean up after her son, who was not present at the time of the search. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, youth consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The judgment also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, Eric R. Werner, and Amy C. Welshhans of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice in this matter."
