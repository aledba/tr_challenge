  "summary": "On March 5, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a final judgment against Attending Homecare Services LLC, a home health care provider based in New York City, that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.2 million.  The court also ordered Attending to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, Abdullayeva, a member of the Home Care Workers of America, was required to join the union on behalf of its members and to participate in the selection of an arbitrator. The complaint alleges that the arbitration clause in the collective-bargaining agreement did not satisfy the \"clear and unmistakable\" requirements of the agreement, and that the selected arbitrator was biased or would conduct arbitration in bad faith.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Attending agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering it to comply with the court's order. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Gary F. Brunson and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Messrs. Braunstein and Brunson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Manhattan, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
