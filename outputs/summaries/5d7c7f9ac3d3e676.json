  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment in favor of a New Jersey resident who was charged with defrauding his business by charging a $29.99 initiation fee.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, N.J., alleges that, in enacting the Retail Investment and Securities Act of 1933 (RISA), the New Jersey State Attorney General's Office (\"Securities Act\") and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"Bureau of Investigation\") charged defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections 10(b) and 15(a)(2) and 13(b)(2)(B) and 14(c) thereunder.

District Judge in Newark issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order temporarily restraining the defendants from violating the charged provisions of RISA and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $39.99 per month.  On May 26, 2019, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Rule 4:6-2(e) and ordered them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a $20,000 civil penalty. The court's order also prohibits defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, loan, automobile, or other security contract, and from imposing any pre-judgment interest or penalty on a third party.
