  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a former employee of Infectious Disease Associates, Inc., a highly specialized medical practice where doctors and nurses diagnose and treat patients with life-threatening infections.  According to the SEC's complaint, from 2003 until 2014, Winnie worked as an IV nurse at IDA, where she was required to use both arms and hands to carry IV bags and boxes of medications. The complaint alleges that, in 2014, when Winnie had surgery on her shoulder, she was told that she would need four months of leave to complete her job. In reality, as alleged in the complaint, she could not do her job because she had failed oral antibiotics and needed a new full-time nurse. In addition, the complaint further alleges that Winnie told IDA's manager of training for electronic medical records that, when she was released to work, she would \"give it up. Don't even bother\" when learning the new electronic medical record system. Winnie also allegedly told her doctor that she could do all of her job duties without restrictions.  The complaint further alleged that, after her surgery, she received an e-mail from IDA informing her that she needed to take a four-month leave of absence because she was unable to lift any weight with her left arm.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Winnie. The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.
