  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against a Boston man who was convicted of assault by means of a dangerous weapon in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that on July 28, 2016, a Boston woman was walking with her two young daughters, ages eight and five, in the Hyde Park section of Boston when she heard a man saying, \"Excuse me, that's him.\" The complaint alleges that the defendant then pulled out a toy gun with a tan bottom, told the victim \"to give him what she had,\" and then demanded money from the victim. According to the complaint, the defendant replied that there was nothing here for him, that he was being a coward, and that he should leave. The complaint charges the defendant with violating Section 15B of the Exchange Act, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendant. The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office in this matter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Boston Police Department, and the Massachusetts Department of Justice."
