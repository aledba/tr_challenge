  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered summary disposition of a civil injunctive action brought by a former trustee of Henry Ford Village, Inc., a Michigan retirement community.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Michigan, alleges that, on May 22, 2006, David Smith entered into an agreement with Henry Ford to pay $126,861.93 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his alleged ill-gotten gains. The settlement is subject to court approval.  According to the complaint, Smith consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a $16,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Smith agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions and to the appointment of a receiver under Section 5 of the Exchange Act. The final judgment also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in violation of these provisions, and bars him from serving as a trustee of a public company.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Smith.  On May 24, 2014, the court granted summary disposition in favor of all defendants, including Smith, on the basis of a finding by the court that he had violated the anti-fraud provision of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The court also granted relief to the trustee of the retirement community, including a temporary restraining order and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the re-entry of the unit. The court granted the relief sought by the SEC, including relief to Smith, and ordered the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver. The receiver has agreed to the issuance of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to comply with the terms of the proposed settlement, and requiring him to provide an accounting of his losses in the event of a default judgment that he is found liable for violating those provisions. In addition, the receiver will be required to provide proof of the receiver\u2019s receipt of the refund in a timely manner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Insurance, and the Michigan Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
