  "summary": "On May 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment in favor of discretionary transfer of a juvenile defendant to a criminal district court for the purpose of recovering his criminal history.  The court found that appellant committed capital murder, aggravated assault, and felony theft in connection with a carjacking that occurred on January 2017.  According to the court's order, the defendant, Daniel Gerding, told officers that he and C.T. Gerding were robbed in a movie theater parking lot.  Gerding allegedly told the officers that a Hispanic male \"attempted to rob\" Gerding and stole his truck.  As alleged in the court\u2019s order, Gerding was shot in the back, and he later died of his injuries.  In a separate case, filed in federal district court in Houston, Texas, the court ruled that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court was entitled to a discretionary transfer based on the reasonable and factually sufficient evidence presented to it by the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  On May 9, the Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 54.02 of the Family Code, and ordered the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of restitution the court has already paid to the defendant.  A hearing on May 10, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. Eastern.  An examination that followed the examination that led to the decision was conducted by Assistant Chief of the Criminal Division of the Texas Department of Public Safety, and the case was supervised by Senior Trial Counsel Robert C.
