  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against the Texas Education Agency (TEA) for failing to provide due process and due process protection to school districts and charter schools.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that the Texas Department of Education (DOE) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the Commission improperly revoked the charter of an open-enrollment charter school based on its poor academic and financial performance.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, AYW consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the Commissioner from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the Texas Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against the Commission for violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act.   The Commission's final judgment also prohibits it from issuing or enforcing an order to revoke a school district or charter school's charter, and orders the Commissioner to determine whether to revoke the school's accreditation or grant a temporary restraining order to prevent the school from violating those provisions. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Office of Education, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Commission on Education and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Aug. 31, 2018)."
