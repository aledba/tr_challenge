  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against John Giordano, a city of Girard, Ohio officer convicted of animal cruelty for beating his dog.  The final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently restrains the conviction from 2020.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ohio on February 16, 2016, a former city manager in Ohio pleaded no contest to a felony charge of cruelty to animals. The complaint alleged that, on Feb. 16, 2015, Giordo entered his no-contest plea and entered a plea of no contest, which was deemed satisfied by the court's finding that there was insufficient evidence of the nature of the alleged crime. The court also ruled that the plea violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the double-jeopardy provision of Section 959.13 of the Ohio Revised Code. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's decision to revoke the conviction on June 17, 2020, the Commission agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The Commission also issued a discretionary appeal against the Commission finding that it had improperly granted the Commission the right to determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the Court at a later date.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed a parallel criminal action. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John R. Birkenheier and supervised by Scott L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Graham Loomis. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.
