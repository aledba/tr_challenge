  "summary": "On December 7, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Crossroads Ventures LLC, a New York-based real estate development company, for failing to comply with a court order requiring it to submit an environmental impact statement.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albany, New York, the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation (DEC) issued an order requiring the company to submit a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the resort project.  The Commission's order required that the company submit an EIS that included a detailed analysis of the project's potential impact on the environment.

Finally, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and an order to halt the construction of the Belleayre Resort at Catskill Park.  On December 13, 2018, the Court granted the court's request for an emergency court order and ordered that the matter be handled by the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, with the assistance of the New York Office of the Secretary of State's Office, the Department of Environmental Protection, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of Inspector General of the United States Postal Inspection Service (OIGS).
