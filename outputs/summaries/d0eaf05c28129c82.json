  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Robin A. Patrusky, a resident of Smithtown, New York, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 11, 2015, Patrusk, then residing at 12 Redan Drive in Smithtown at the time she purchased the home, claimed that the 2013 Transfer was fraudulent, and that she had an interest in the home before the 2015 Lien was entered.  The complaint further alleges that, as a result of the 2013 Lien, she was unable to avoid the lien because she acquired the home in 2013 and never lost her interest in it.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Financial Regulation today announced that it filed an emergency action against Patrusksky and her husband, Michael Cantanzaro, for violations of Section 522 of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins Patruska from violating Sections 522, 566, and 566 of the New York State Securities Act of 1933, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The court's order also prohibits Patruskaya from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the filing of a judgment against her. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in this matter."
