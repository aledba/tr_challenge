  "summary": "On January 31, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment in favor of Altech Controls Corporation and Richard Alsenz on breach of fiduciary duty and fraud charges.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants misrepresented to the trial court that the contract was not clear-cut and that the parties had standing to bring claims against each other based on material facts.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of the defendants' mismanagement and the unauthorized transfer of substantial sums of money to other parties, the company's finances were left in shambles and defendants were deprived of the profits which would have been made if the defendants had acted in accordance with the contract.   The complaint further alleges that in addition to the mismanagement, the defendant mismanaged and paid his son without authority, transferred millions of dollars to another party without authorization, and failed to disclose an unauthorized diversion of funds.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties of up to five times the amount of their profits.  Additionally, defendants agreed to pay a civil penalty of five times their profits, which is equal to the amount owed to them by the jury.  Altech controls and Alsenzbach agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins them from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions, and requires them to provide a copy of the judgment to the court for further determination by the court upon motion of the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Insurance, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
