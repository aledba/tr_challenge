  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment in favor of Delta Business Center, LLC, a Michigan-based printing company, against the State Tax Commission (STC) for denying Delta's application for a tax exemption under the plant rehabilitation and industrial development districts act (PRIDDA).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Detroit, the STC improperly denied Delta\u2019s application for an IFEC exemption because it failed to establish that the property was being used as an \"industrial property\" when it was being renovated.  The complaint further alleges that, in addition to being liable for property taxes, Delta had to be liable for payment of ad valorem property taxes and furnished proof of that liability.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Delta failed to provide proof of liability for its alleged violations of the PRIDDA.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Delta has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Delta to pay a civil penalty of $3,900,000.  Delta has also agreed to a settlement where it will be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206 of Rule 206 thereunder and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 207-552(7).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Commerce, and the Michigan Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
