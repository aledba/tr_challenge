  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Walter Reed and Steven Reed, Jr., a former district attorney for the 22nd Judicial District of Louisiana, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Walter Reed solicited funds from donors on the premise that those funds would be used to facilitate his reelection, but instead used them for personal expenses unrelated to his campaign or the holding of public office.  According to the complaint, Walter Reed paid Steven Reed $14,000 in campaign funds for producing an anti-drug service announcement worth only $2,000, and then used those funds to pay for dinners with Pentecostal pastors and their families, to recruit referrals for the private legal practice he operated concurrently with his District Attorney service, and to pay a $6,500 civil penalty.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the district court improperly imposed a five-year limitations period on the amount of any civil penalty or forfeiture.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of $46,200 jointly and severally against both defendants, and impose civil penalties of $609,217.08 against each defendant.  Walter Reed also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of a penny stock, and pay a civil penalty of $5,000.  Finally, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, and ordered the defendants to surrender their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest in the amounts of their respective bank accounts.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the New Orleans District Court issued an order granting the SEC the right to seek a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities laws.  A hearing scheduled for September 5, 2018 is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.    The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Office for New Orleans and the Louisiana Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
