  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon for his role in the December 2011 murder of Jaclyn Wirth.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Norwich, Connecticut, alleges that William Collelo, a resident of the Mohegan Apartments located in Connecticut, and Harold Butler, an individual he met at the bar, engaged in an extensive search of the area. The complaint alleges that, shortly after the victim's murder, the defendants encountered an individual named Ezekial \"Junie\" Boyce, who they believed had access to a handgun. According to the complaint, the defendant told the two men that he was going to the area of the river to find Boyce because he believed it was involved in the homicide. However, as the complaint alleges, after learning that the gun belonged to the defendant, he immediately became nervous about possessing the gun because the gun was so hopelessly degraded that it was not reliable evidence for the jury to form any link between it and Wirth's murder. As a result of this conduct, the court improperly admitted the defendants' entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $160,000, and a civil penalty of $100,000. The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendants from using the internet to disseminate or sell any information about the case to the public. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Connecticut State Police, and the Connecticut Office of Criminal Investigations in this matter."
