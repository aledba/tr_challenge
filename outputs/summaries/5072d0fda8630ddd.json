  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered final judgments in a civil injunctive action against Indiana-based organizations that have been charged with violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that Indiana violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 542 of the Exchange Act, Indiana improperly removed the name of a registered voter from the rolls of at least 10 states.  According to the complaint, the Commission on Civil Rights and the Commission's Office of Inspector General (OIG) previously issued an order requiring the Commission to conduct an examination of the accuracy of the Commission\u2019s findings.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the Commission.  On January 4, 2019, the Honorable J. Bradley King granted the Commission its request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order suspending the Commission from issuing any further orders. The Commission's order, which is subject to court approval, orders Indiana to comply with the Commission Order, pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the Commission order's findings, Indiana has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the CommissionOrder, ordering it to pay a $75,000 civil penalty, and imposing an officer-and-director bar.  It has also agreed to pay an $8,500 civil penalty and to a $10,000 officer and director bar, and to the appointment of a receiver to oversee the Commission upon Inspection of Public Records.  To learn more about how the Commission operates, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 4, 2009).  The Commission also issued an Order suspending the registration of certain non-affiliated organizations.   The complaint charges Indiana with violating Section 562 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") for violations of Sections 542(a)(3) and 567(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 5b2-1 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Section 15(a) and (c) of Section 206(1) of The Exchange Act and Rules 206(2) and 206(4)-8 thereunder and with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Rules of Practice.
