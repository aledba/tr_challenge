  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against a Canadian citizen and Canadian citizen for wrongfully retaining their two minor children, H.M.G. and H.F.G., in the United States and outside Canada.  The court found that Shenoa Taleese Leslie and Hector Armando Gil-Leyva violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that Ms. Leslie failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that the children were at a grave risk of harm when they were removed from their Canadian homes.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Canada today announced criminal charges against Ms.Leslie.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Calgary on January 10, 2018, the magistrate judge granted a temporary restraining order and ordered the return of the children to a Canadian court.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the court held that the defendants violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws and ordered them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On February 13, 2019, a federal district court in New York entered an order granting the defendants access to a court-appointed receiver to facilitate the repatriation of the two children.  As set forth in the court order, the receiver will receive a copy of the order and will determine whether to proceed with the proceeding.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 579:25.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district courts in Colorado and Washington, D.C., charging the receiver with violating Section 10 Section of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Section 17(a)(1) thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder; and the complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and penny stock bars against the receiver.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC's litigation will be led by Jennifer A. Kasper and Mr. Karpel. The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Canadian Attorney General's Office, the Canadian Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Canadian Immigration and Citizenship and Immigration Services."
