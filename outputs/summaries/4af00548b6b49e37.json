The court found that Bondi violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.

The judgment also orders Bondi to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  Bondi has agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 17 (a)(2) and (c) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act.
