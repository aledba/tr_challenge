  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Louisiana today announced charges against a Bienville, Louisiana man for his role in a 2016 armed robbery that left LaDarrius Coleman injured and nearly unresponsive.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on April 21, 2016, Lynn Tony Clark, Jr., of Arcadia, Louisiana, was the victim of a robbery and was the aggressor. The complaint alleges that Clark was the only person present in the courtroom at the time of the robbery when he was confronted by two men who demanded that he \"beat him up, whatever\" and \"let him go back to your apartment and harm your wife and kids.\"  The complaint further alleges that Coleman was not able to identify Clark as a person involved in the robbery because he was unable to identify his mother and grandmother.  The SEC alleges that, in a parallel criminal action, Clark was convicted of second-degree battery, which carries a maximum sentence of 15 years' imprisonment, and armed robbery, committed with a firearm.  Clark was sentenced to 20 years at hard labor on the conviction for armed robbery and 10 years at home with a $100,000 civil penalty.  In a second criminal case, the SEC charged a second defendant for his participation in the armed robbery in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Clark consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  He also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to a three-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from associating with any third-party, including with a law enforcement agency, from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including in the purchase, sale, or purchase of a firearm, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $250,000 penalty for his part in the scheme.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the request for a temporary restraining order against Clark, ordering him to remain in the office, and appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.  McCole agreed to the appointment of a receiver pursuant to the court's order."
