  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of two counts of second-degree murder and five counts of attempted second degree murder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, Louisiana on August 10, 2014, Jeffery R. \"Blood\" Finnie, a resident of New Orleans East, and his wife, Vivien Anderson, were indicted on the same charges.  The complaint alleges that Finnie and Anderson told Finnie that they were going to kill him because he had \"moved the hammer\" from the kitchen to the scene of the crime.  Finnie allegedly hid the gun in his apartment, and Nelson allegedly used the gun to shoot the two men.  As alleged in the complaint, Finnie also told the court that he had seen two men with a gun in Rivers' apartment the day before the shooting, and that one of the men had a gun.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Finnie.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' motion for new trial, granted the defense's request for a temporary restraining order, and issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Timothy R. Welshhans and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Inspector General, the Louisiana State Police, the U. S. Attorney's Department for the Eastern District of Louisiana, and the Louisiana Department of Criminal Justice."
