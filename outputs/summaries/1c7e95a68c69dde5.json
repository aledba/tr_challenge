  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon for his role in a 2016 felony rape.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ohio, alleges that Sixteen-year-old Jordan L.S., of Port Clinton, Ohio, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in a second assignment of error, the court improperly imposed a suspended commitment on R.J. Carrisales, the son of a family friend who was living at the time of the alleged crime.  According to the complaint, after learning about the alleged criminal conduct, Carrisale agreed to the suspension without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint to the court, and agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against L. S., who was charged with the same conduct.  On June 8, 2017, the Court of Common Pleas granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations, and ordered the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500. The judge also ordered that the amount of the civil penalty be determined by the court at a later date. The SEC also issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney. The Court's order also suspended the defendant's right to due process, including the right to a fair and impartial hearing. The order also prohibits defendants from participating in any type of conduct that constitutes a \"permanent or substantial impairment\" of a person's ability to resist or consent to sexual conduct, including that a person who has been convicted of a felony commit a serious felony and is liable to a penalty of 10 years or more.  It also prohibits individuals from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in the securities industry, including those who are registered to sell or offer to sell securities in the brokerage firm or through the broker-dealer. In addition, the order prohibits the sale or offer of any securities in connection with a criminal conviction, including securities that are subject to a court-ordered suspension. The orders also prohibit the sale, offer of, and solicitation of any investment in a securities firm or in any way related to the purchase or sale of a security"
