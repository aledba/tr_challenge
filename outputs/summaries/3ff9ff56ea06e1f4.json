  "summary": "On February 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas entered a final judgment against Carlson Auction Service, Inc. (Carlson), a Kansas-based private motor carrier, for failing to register and pay Unified Carrier Registration Act (UCR) fees when it employed a driver to drive an empty tow truck from Carlson's auction house in Topeka to the purchaser in Missouri. The court found that Carlson violated the federal registration and fee requirements for a private motor vehicle. Carlson's attorney, Gary Davenport, agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $300. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Kansas, charges Carlson with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. Carlson has also agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Carlson. The SEC also announced that it filed an emergency action against Carlson, charging him with violations of the registration provision of Sections 13(a)(1) and 13(b)(2)(A). The SEC is continuing its investigation, which is continuing to be conducted by the SEC's Office of Inspector General, with the assistance of the Kansas Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kansas Attorney General's Office. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Motor Carrier Safety Division.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the FBI, the Kansas Department of Insurance, the Missouri Department of Commerce, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the FBI's Criminal Investigations, the Texas Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Office of Insurance Regulation."
