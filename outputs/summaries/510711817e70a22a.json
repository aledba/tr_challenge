  "summary": "On November 1, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against three prison officials for failing to follow the due process provisions of the federal prison disciplinary laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Gladyse C. Taylor, Leif M. McCarthy, and Eldon L. Cooper violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Taylor and McCarthy also violated the due-process provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Section 504.80 of the Department of Corrections (\"DOL\").  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to adequately disclose to the disciplinary committee that they had violated certain of the department's policies and procedures.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Taylor, McCarthy and Cooper.  On November 2, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Taylor.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against each of them. The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval, and to a conduct-based injunction.  To learn more about how to apply for a court-ordered injunction, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221."
