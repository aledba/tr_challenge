  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Brenda K. Milne in an ejectment action brought against her husband, Monte L. Moorer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Mobile, Ala., alleges that Milne violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Milne and Moorer sought to redeem the house at a tax sale for nonpayment of the 2013 ad valorem taxes. The complaint alleges that the property was sold at the tax sale and Milne sought possession of the house and the recovery of mesne profits for the period Milne had occupied the house.  Milne refused to surrender the house, and the complaint charges that he was not entitled to the property and that he had violated Section 40-10-83 of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the parties.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order requiring the defendants to comply with the court's order.  On January 7, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action against Milne, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $377.80, which is equal to the amount of the reasonable attorney's fees Milne was obligated to pay in order to recover the property, and ordering the receiver to disgorge his or her profits in a parallel action. The court also ordered the receivership of the property to be conducted by the receiver and supervised by a certified public accountant, with the assistance of the Alabama Secretary of State's Office, the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations Division, the Alabama Office of Financial Regulation, the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Fraud Task Force, the Mobile Office of Insurance Regulation and the Alabama Department of Banking and Securities and Investments' Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) Risk Analysis and Detection Center.
