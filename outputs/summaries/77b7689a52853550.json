  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California yesterday entered a final judgment against California-based insurance company California FAIR Plan Association, finding that it violated its contractual and statutory obligations under Section 2071 of the Insurance Code.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, California on September 13, 2009, the SEC alleges that, in issuing its standard form fire insurance policy, respondent failed to disclose that it was required to provide coverage against the peril of fire only, or in combination with coverage against other perils, within weeks of losing a home or property.  The complaint further alleges that respondent's policy improperly excluded coverage for \"trees and shrubs\" and \"debris removal\" from the calculation of the promised coverage for total losses, and that in issuing such policies, respondent had provided less protection than statutorily mandated by the federal insurance policy.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the insurance company failed to provide adequate coverage for losses in excess of their policy limits.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, respondent consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On October 31, 2013, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct a hearing on the matter. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Office of Insurance Regulation in this matter."
