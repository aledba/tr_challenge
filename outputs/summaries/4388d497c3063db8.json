  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Phillips 66 Company, Inc., a Texas-based oil and gas company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, alleges that Phillips violated the books and records provision of the Exchange Act by failing to provide sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict on the Receivables Counterclaim.  According to the complaint, the jury found Phillips liable for overstating the value of the receivables when, in fact, Phillips paid Nanda $1,051,093 for the inventory receivable and $317,801 for the rent receivable.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Phillips consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating Exchange Act Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and requires him to provide a precise record citation to support his claim.  In addition, the court granted Phillips a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $50,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Nanda also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  As a result of the settlement, Phillips will be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities for which he or she has consented.  On the SEC's continuing investigation, the agency's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant.gov website to quickly and easily identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Denver Office of Financial Regulation, and the Colorado Office of the Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
