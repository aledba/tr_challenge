  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New York City building owner for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, on October 23, 2014, the building owner and its tenants violated Section 28-210 of the federal securities laws. The complaint alleges that, contrary to the defendants' representations to the court, the property owner and tenants were not liable for the violations and instead were liable for a $45,000 penalty for each violation.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to consider the extent of harm to the tenants' unlawful subleasing of their apartments at the same time, and failed to take any reasonable steps to correct the violations.  In a parallel action, the New York Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the building's owner.  On November 24, 2014 the court issued an order imposing a $38,000 civil penalty on the building. The court's order, which is subject to court approval, requires the court to determine whether to impose the civil penalties at a later date.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-20-2014.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleging that, in violation of Section 30(b), Section 17(a)(1) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining the defendants from violating Section 28\u2013210, and ordering them to pay $5,800 in civil penalties. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael O. Schiff and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Mr. Schiff, Ms. Barry, and Ms. Schiff. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter and Antonia Chion in the Manhattan Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
