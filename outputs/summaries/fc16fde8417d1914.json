  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in a civil injunctive action brought by the wives of Wallace Loy Tim Wong, who died in 2010.  The court issued the final judgments on December 10, 2018, ordering the defendants to pay $17.5 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the court's order, the defendants were entitled to trial preference based on the entry of judgments that were not immediately appealable.  In addition, the court issued an order freezing the defendants\u2019 assets, freezing their assets, and issuing a temporary restraining order preventing the defendants from acting as a party to the litigation.  On January 23, 2019, the trial court entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 9 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, and 13b-20 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court\u2019s order, defendants consented to entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering the parties to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $17,500. The court also granted the parties the right to a preliminary injunction of sorts with respect to the enforcement of the 1996 judgment, which requires defendants to remit a portion of the proceeds from the sale of trust assets that occurred after the death of Wallace.
