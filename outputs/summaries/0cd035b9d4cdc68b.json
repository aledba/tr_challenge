  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Mercy Crystal Lake Hospital and Medical Center, Inc., a Chicago-area health care facility, against the recommendation of the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in McHenry County, Illinois, alleges that, in January 2017, the Illinois Department of Public Health (DPH) issued an order granting a certificate of need for a new hospital in Crystal Lake, Illinois.  According to the complaint, the DPH issued the order without admitting or denying the allegations in the application.  In its order granting the application, DPH also found that the Board's decision was arbitrary and capricious because it did not consider the need for the hospital to meet the requirements of the state's requirements for a 100-bed hospital.   The complaint further alleges that Mercy's application did not meet the criteria for a \"performance-based\" hospital, because the hospital had excess beds and ICU beds, and that the project was not able to provide a proper standard of health care service for the community.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that the board failed to consider the merits of the application when it issued its order for Mercy to apply for and receive a permit for a $81 million hospital construction project.  DPH's complaint charges Mercy with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On June 20, 2017, a federal district court in Chicago entered a temporary restraining order against Mercy from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering the company to comply with the court's order, and ordering it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million. The court also ordered Mercy to pay an $80 million civil penalty and to provide an emergency room and other support services. The SEC also instituted an administrative proceeding against Mercy on June 21, 2017.  As set forth in the SEC's Complaint, the District Attorney's Office filed an emergency action on June 22, 2017 against Mercy, alleging that it violated the Administrative Procedure Act, Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the Administrative Procedures Act, and a conduct-based injunction against further violations of Section 13(b)(2) and (3) of Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1. The case is being handled by John McGlasson, Chief of the Chicago Regional Office, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson"
