  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in a custody case against a child's mother and paternal grandparents.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that the mother and her paternal grandparents violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the court found that the grandparents were acting with the mother's permission when making decisions regarding the custody of the child.  As alleged, however, the mother did not relinquish care and control over the child for more than 24 months, even though she had regular contact and visitation with the child while she was in their custody.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in a 2006 proceeding in which the parents obtained a consent order granting the grandparents joint legal custody, the grandparents did not remove the child from their custody until the summer of 2012, after which she relinquished custody to the grandparents for a prolonged period of time, during which she assumed the role of a noncustodial parent in virtually every way.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering the grandparents to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 each.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert A. Hannan of the U.N. Division of Justice in Manhattan granted the grandparents' request for a temporary restraining order and ordered them to return the child to his mother.  Hannan also agreed to be enjoined from future violations of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") as well as to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Hanauer agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (January 24, 2018).  The court granted the grandmother's request for an injunction and ordered the grandfather to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court, which was entered by Judge Hannan on August 22, 2018.  An order appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver will be instituted on August 26, 2018 and will be reviewed by the court upon motion of the court.  Separately, the SEC has issued an order appointing an independent receiver for the receiver of any emergency relief arising from the alleged misconduct of the grandparents."
