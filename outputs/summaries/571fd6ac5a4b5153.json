  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against California-based attorney Timothy Tierney for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, Tierney, through his law firm, The Soni Law Firm, engaged attorney Ron Perez to work on publicity claims and patent prosecution. The complaint alleges that Tierney was not required to file a timely response to an arbitration award because the arbitration award was not binding and the arbitrator had jurisdiction over the matter. The SEC alleges that, in addition, Tierneys had failed to timely file a response to a petition to vacate or correct a fee arbitration award by mail, because he did not timely respond to the client\u2019s request for an attorney-client arbitration award.  The complaint further alleges that Soni failed to respond to a written judgment that he had received from an arbitrator that he was entitled to an award of attorney fees.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Tierney.  On March 18, 2017, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered Tierney to pay a civil penalty of $2,890, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement and prejudgment interest that the court will impose.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint,Tierney consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $79,898 in attorney fees and $23,981 in civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by David S. Karton and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter in the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Karpel. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Professional and Risk Analysis, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Department of Insurance."
