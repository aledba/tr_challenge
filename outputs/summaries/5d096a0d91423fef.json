  "summary": "On March 29, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the agency that terminated the parental rights of a child in need of immediate and long-term placement.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 13(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, from January through October 2018, the agency terminated parental rights to A.T., who was in the care of another family member who was unable to meet the child's needs.  In its order, the court found that there was insufficient evidence to determine that a termination of parental rights was in place when there were multiple available relatives and DHS failed to fully explore relative placement in compliance with the concurrent goal of the case established by the trial court.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from future violations of Section 9(a)(3) and 10b)(5) and orders her to submit to random drug screens, complete a counseling assessment and follow any recommendations, submit to a psychological evaluation, successfully complete counseling if recommended, and maintain stable housing and employment. The court also granted the agency's request for a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered her to return to the custody of her father and mother.  On March 31, 2020, the SEC filed an emergency action against the mother and father of the child in a related criminal case, ordering her to relinquish her parental rights and to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  A hearing for the case was scheduled for April 26, 2020.  An SEC examination that followed the examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson, Ms. O'Connor, and Ms. Migues. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services, and the Missouri Department of Child and Family Services in this matter."
