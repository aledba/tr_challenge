  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on June 14, 2017, entered a final judgment against Dakota Access Pipeline Company and its owner, Dakota Access LLC, ordering the company to comply with the court's order to vacate the company's prior approval of the pipeline.  The court also ordered Dakota Access to submit a detailed environmental impact analysis to the agency.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, filed on July 25, 2016, the court found that Dakota Access had failed to adequately assess the impact of a potential oil spill on Native American and low-income communities by failing to provide a sufficient basis for vacating the pipeline at the time the court issued its order.  As alleged in the complaint, the Court found that the Corps had insufficiently addressed certain of the concerns raised in its prior opinion, including that the pipeline's crossing at Lake Oahe is highly likely to cause significant harm to the Tribes' fishing and hunting rights.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Dakota today announced criminal charges against the company.  On June 6, 2017 the court granted a temporary restraining order and issued an order temporarily restraining Dakota Access from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered it to submit an amended environmental impact statement by the end of the year.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and orders the companies to pay civil penalties.  Dakota Access also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000 and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Spencer L. Bendell of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Tom Siguaw and Steve Rove of the Division of Environmental Quality. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
