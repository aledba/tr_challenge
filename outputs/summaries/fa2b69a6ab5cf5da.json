According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, Mississippi, Jackson made two false statements to a jury in Jackson, Mississippi.  The complaint alleges that Jackson failed to disclose to the jury that he had engaged in a pattern of aggressive, aggressive, and unprovoked conduct that resulted in multiple felony charges.  Jackson also allegedly used a knife to commit a separate felony, and the SEC alleges that, in Jackson II, Jackson III, Jackson IV, and Jackson IV engaged in similar conduct.  As alleged in the complaint, Jackson II and Jackson III violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5-203(A) of the federal securities laws, which require defendants to show cause and effect in a criminal proceeding.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Jackson III.  On May 4, 2015, the federal district court in New Jersey entered a temporary restraining order against Jackson, ordering Jackson III to surrender his passport, and ordering Jackson IV to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively.  At the same time, the court issued an order suspending Jackson III from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, barring him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against Jackson IV.
