  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Riverside, Inc., doing business as Riverside Harley-Davidson, to compel arbitration of claims arising out of or related to the sale of a motorcycle.  According to the SEC's complaint, on April 19, 2015, Alfredo Fuentes entered into a written agreement with a third party to buy a motorcycle from Riverside. The latter agreement included an arbitration clause; the former agreement did not. As alleged in the complaint, the third party beneficiary of the purchase agreement, Riverside, was not a party to the arbitration clause and was not an agent of any third party. In addition, the complaint alleges that Riverside entered into an arbitration agreement with another party that it did not include in its agreement. The complaint further alleges that, in its complaint, Riverside was not entitled to compel the arbitration because, as a general rule, a nonparty expressly specified as able to invoke the arbitration clauses is not an appropriate situation for applying equitable estoppel.  The complaint also alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Riverside.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s action, Riverside consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of its profits. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the Nevada Secretary of State Office of Financial Regulation in this matter."
