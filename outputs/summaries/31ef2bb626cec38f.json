  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee today entered a final judgment in favor of a former security officer who filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that he failed to timely file a charge with the agency.  According to the SEC's complaint, on August 4, 2017, a security officer at a shipping center in Memphis, Tennessee, failed to detect a weapon in packages about to be loaded on FedEx aircraft. The complaint alleges that Jones failed to file his charge within 180 days of his termination, and that he was entitled to the benefit of the 300-day filing period provided for by the federal agency. In addition, as alleged in the complaint, Jones was required to file a complaint within 300 days of the date of the alleged discrimination.  The complaint further alleges that, in relevant part, that Jones met with an EEOC legal advisor who told him he had 300 days to file the charge.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, however, Jones consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $250,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Civil Rights today announced that it has issued an order suspending Jones from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Eric Werner and supervised by Marc Blau of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York, and the Tennessee Department of State Office of Equal Opportunity."
