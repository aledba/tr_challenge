  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Arctic Cat Inc., a Canadian snowmobile manufacturer, for its alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Arctic Cat, a Canadian-based manufacturer of snowmobiles, and its subsidiary, Arctic Cat Snowmobile, Inc., violated the anti-infringement provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  According to the complaint, the defendants misrepresented to the jury that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not be motivated to combine a pyramidal brace assembly with an upper-level strut assembly.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to establish that the upper-tier strut assembly was simply an extension of the strut assembly, and that the lower-leg strut assembly had no support in the claims.  In addition, the court found that the suspension of the trial, which began in November 2017, was unnecessary because the jury had already deliberated on the merits of the defendants\u2019 claims, and the jury found the defendants liable for violations of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the Defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of judgments that impose permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Canadian Securities Inspection Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service (CFIS), and the U.K. Secret Service.  For further information, see Press Release No. 5, 2018."
