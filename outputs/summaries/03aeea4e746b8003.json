  "summary": "On March 29, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a New York-based insurance company for its role in an insurance policy liability.  The SEC's complaint, filed on June 10, 2009, alleges that Cesar Arias, while employed as a kitchen worker at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York City, slipped on a slippery surface of the hotel floor and fell, causing him serious, severe and permanent injuries and disabilities.  According to the complaint, Arias was an additional insured under the policy, and thus entitled to a duty to indemnify.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Stoncor consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2.5 million.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Arias.  Among other things, the SEC also announced that it had filed a civil injunctive action against a third insurance company, alleging that it was liable for liability arising out of the company's use of a substance called pyrrhotite in constructing plaintiffs' homes, allegedly causing defects in the homes.  It also charged a fourth insurance company as a defendant in a related action, claiming that its duty to defend and indemnify was triggered by a filing of a civil action by a state or foreign court, and that the company was not required to pay a penalty in the same manner as it was charged in the Wilton/Brillhart action.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that the insurance company failed to comply with a federal court order requiring it to provide timely and accurate information about claims arising from the insurance claims in its insurance policy.   In addition, the Complaint alleges that, contrary to the stated intent of the Commission, the Commission has not provided sufficient information to determine whether a judgment should be entered in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges: (1) StonCor with violating the duty to protect, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. (2) The Commission has agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval. (3) The Complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, and an officer-and-director bar."
