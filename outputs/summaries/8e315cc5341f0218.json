  "summary": "On July 1, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against a New York City licensed boiler operator.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that, in 2013, Christopher R. Gross, a former custodian at New York State & Local Employees' Retirement Sys., was denied an HPBOE license because he stole an unidentified liquid from DOE, used DOE property, and concealed his receipt of payment for work on DOE property.  According to the complaint, Gross and his brother, Rickey Lombardi, engaged in a scheme to defraud DOE of hundreds of thousands of dollars in custodial payroll funds through bid rigging.  Gross and Lombardi also allegedly engaged in bid rigging that resulted in the loss of their jobs.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Gross, Lombardi and Schmeidel violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, Gross consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,655,078 in prejudgment interest, a civil penalty of $100,000, and an officer-and-director bar of $75,000.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Gross for his participation in a bid rigging scheme.  On August 15, 2014, the Honorable Judge Richard G. Kasper of the New York Court of Appeals issued an order suspending Gross from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney, ordering him to provide the SEC with a copy of the judgment, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against Gross.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, and No. 17(b)(5).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Department of Education's Office of Inspections and Examinations, under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone, Director of the Office of Inspector General's Criminal Justice.  A hearing scheduled for November 16, 2013, will be conducted by Mark Assa and supervised by Gregory Kasper.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Cohen, Michael E. Schiff, Robert Katz, Kenneth Loeffler, and Robert Stiles, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Cohen and Ms. Schiff."
