  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Vermont today announced criminal charges against Fortieth Burlington, LLC, a Vermont-based real estate developer, for defrauding the city of Burlington in connection with an extension request.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Vermont, alleges that, in September 2016, the Vermont Department of Natural Resources granted Fortieth's request for an extension of the city's 2011 Conditional Use Determination (2011 CUD) for the Champlain Parkway project.  According to the complaint, Fortieth alleges that the city failed to comply with the 2011 CUD and was required to redelineate the project's wetland boundaries prior to seeking an extension.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Fortieth failed to disclose that the project had significant impacts on the wetlands that were included in the original CUD.  Fortieth also alleges that he failed to adequately assess the impact of the project on the wetland and other wetlands on the project site.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's Complaint, the SEC has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Fortieth from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Fortieth to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Vermont Office of Inspector General."
