  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of multiple counts of attempted first-degree murder in connection with a home burglary.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on May 6, 2017, Monteco K. Frost went to Rayville, Louisiana to \"hit a lick\" or commit a robbery or burglary. According to the complaint, Deshun McDaniel, Sr., a resident of the McDaniel family, and Rontarrius Jackson, a relative of Deshun's, agreed to testify against Frost, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, that they had specific intent to commit attempted first degree murder. The complaint further alleges that Hardiman, Jackson, and Hardiman were childhood friends of the defendants, and that, based on the defendant's extensive juvenile history, they had the requisite mental capacity to commit the crimes. The SEC alleges that the defendants entered the house with the intent to steal drugs, and when confronted by the intruders, Hardiman and Jackson replied, \"No, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to hit a lick.\" The SEC also alleges that Deshun Jr. and Jackson, who are also childhood friends, were the first to enter the house and fired multiple shots into the house, striking Deshun and Jackson's little brother in the head. Deshun Sr.'s testimony, which was corroborated by the evidence presented to the court, was not sufficient for the SEC to conclude that the defendant had a sufficient mental state to commit a first- degree murder of a victim under the felony murder doctrine. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Frost.  In a related matter, the SEC today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Frost and charged him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On November 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, ordering the SEC and the U. S. Attorney's office for New York to conduct a parallel criminal investigation, and ordering the issuance of an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver. The court also ordered the receiver to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver, and to provide an accounting of the alleged misconduct. The receiver has agreed to the appointment of a receiver and to the payment of a penalty equal to the amount of his or her imprisonment."
