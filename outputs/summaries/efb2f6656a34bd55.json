Koeltl of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a judgment against HTV Industries, Inc., a New York-based registered representative, for breach of contract in connection with a $1 million loan default.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, HTV's complaint alleges that, on September 25, 2015, the defendant, Scott A. Ziluck, Esq., agreed to pay $616,275.63, representing outstanding principal due and owing under the Guaranty, in the amount of $43,756.59.
