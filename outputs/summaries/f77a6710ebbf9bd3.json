  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a former Ohio narcotics officer who was convicted of three felony counts of possession of a controlled substance.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the officer's assets, and ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  According to the court's order, on March 30, 2016, officers Michael Bruening and Ryan Butler of the Lake County Narcotics Agency observed a tan Saturn pull into the parking lot of a Target retail store.  As alleged in the complaint, the officers were on the lookout for cars with multiple people, some of whom would make multiple trips into a store while others remained in the vehicle.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against one of the officers for his role in the alleged scheme.  On March 31, 2017, the court issued an order suspending the officer-involved sales of pseudoephedrine, a chemical used to manufacture methamphetamine, for an aggregate term of 60 months.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Defendants agreed to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin Defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Defendants also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, which is equal to the penalty imposed by the court on Defendants in the second trial.  Defendants also were ordered to pay civil penalties of $25,000 and $50,000 for the same amount of time and amount of money they received as a result of the alleged misconduct.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221, July 17, 2017."
