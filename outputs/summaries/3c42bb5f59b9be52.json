  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a former Ohio urologist who was convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, Ashley Padgett worked for Ohio State Pharmacy Board member Leslie Arnold and was hired by Appellant to write prescriptions for Percocet and Adderall. The complaint alleges that during the course of the investigation, she allegedly used a previous relationship to get Appettant to sell her drugs. According to this complaint, Appettants told Padgettt that he gave her the drugs when she was working for him and that he would give her some of the drugs after she bought them. The SEC alleges that, in reality, the two had no romantic relationship and were not engaged in a drug-related relationship. The court also found that, despite having the knowledge and access to contraband, the defendant did not take any money to buy the drugs.  The court's order against Appetterer was granted on the basis of the evidence presented in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced that it has obtained a court order freezing the assets of the defendants and imposing a civil injunctive action against them.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District ofOhio granted the court's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $25,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, which is equal to the amount of money they have already paid in restitution to the victims of the alleged drug-trafficking. The final judgment also orders Appeterer to pay a $20,000 civil penalty and a $10,000 penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Ohio Office of Inspector General, and the case was supervised by Assistant Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley."
