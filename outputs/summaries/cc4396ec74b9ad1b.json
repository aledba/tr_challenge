  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 11, 2016, entered a final judgment in favor of the Social Security Administration (SSA) in a civil injunctive action brought by the agency.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from November 8, 2001 through December 31, 2001, Frank K. was employed as a bridge mechanic, bridge foreman, and road foreman in the State of Vermont. The complaint alleges that he was limited to \u201coccasional reaching overhead with his right shoulder\u201d but that the SSA determined that he had \"[n]o limitation to reaching in any direction.\u201d  The complaint further alleges that Dr. Brovender testified that he did not engage in substantial gainful activity during the relevant period because he \"always assumed that he would heal up or get better.\"  According to the complaint, however, the SEC's 2014 decision added limitations that were not included in the 2011 decision and did not preclude reconsideration of the RFC.  In its 2015 remand order, the court found that the agency had erred at step five of the sequential analysis and that the SEC should have followed the mandate rule.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the Commission has agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-5 thereunder, and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The Commission has also agreed to an order appointing an independent medical examiner to conduct an independent examination of the matter.  On May 10, 2015, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Martin issued an order ordering the SEC to comply with the court's order. The order also imposed a temporary restraining order against the SEC from further violations of the federal securities laws, including the issuance of a cease-and-desist order and the appointment of a receiver. The SEC is continuing its investigation into the matter, with the assistance of the Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Department of Justice. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Frank K., supervised by Craig Jarvis, and supervised by Amy Gwiazda. The Division of Health and Human Services has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about potential scams targeting seniors."
