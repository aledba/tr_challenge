  "summary": "On July 27, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan entered a final judgment against Henry Ford Community College Support Staff Association (the Association) in a civil action brought by the City of Dearborn.  The court found that the Association violated the federal securities laws by failing to adequately protect its members and their families.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Michigan, the Association and Cialone violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the association consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins the defendants from violating the securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In addition, the court granted the Association's motion for summary disposition on the basis that it was satisfied that it had sufficient evidence to determine that the association was liable for the association\u2019s violations of Section 5(b).  The judgment also prohibits the City from imposing any civil penalty against the association.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David Kloian and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Insurance, and the Michigan Office of Inspector General. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
