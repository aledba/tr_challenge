  "summary": "The Texas Medical Board executed an administrative subpoena on Dr. Joseph Zadeh's medical practice on October 22, 2013.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, alleges that the Texas Board of Directors issued a subpoena on the same day that it conducted an administrative search.  According to the complaint, the subpoena was for the immediate production of the medical records of sixteen patients.  As alleged, however, the search was a pretextual search, not a valid administrative search, and the Board did not have the authority to compel immediate compliance with the subpoena.  In its order, the court found that the Board violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Board consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $10,000.  Additionally, the Court granted the Board's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the Board, and ordered the Board to conduct a search of the office and medical records.   The court's order, which is subject to court approval, also prohibits the Board from imposing a search warrant on any physician or practicing physician performing a medical practice.  It also prohibits any search that is not conducted pursuant to a reasonable expectation of privacy, including the search of medical records by a licensed physician.  On the other hand, the District Court held that a search conducted by the Board was not a reasonable substitute for a warrant and that a reasonable person would have believed that the search should be conducted without unreasonable suspicion of wrongdoing.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 589 (Aug. 2, 2018).  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson in the Office of Inspector General and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Health, the United States Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice and the Texas Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0"
