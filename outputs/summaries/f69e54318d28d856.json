(\"Gap\"), a California-based apparel and accessories company, that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, charges Gap with violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws and seeks injunctive relief, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.

The complaint also alleges that, as alleged in the SEC complaint, Gap violated Sections 17 (b)(2)(A), (3), and (4) of The Securities Act and Sections 10(d) and 14(e)(1)(B) and 15e-3 of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b-11, and 14e-13 thereunder; that Gap has a duty of disclosure under Section 5 under the UCL and Rules 10d-1 and 13e-14 thereunder under the SEC registration provisions; that it has an obligation to"
