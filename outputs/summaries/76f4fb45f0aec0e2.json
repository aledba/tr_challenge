  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant insurance company that found the instant plaintiff and other acupuncture PCs to be unlawfully incorporated and not entitled to receive no-fault benefits.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 31, 2013, Downtown Acupuncture, LLC (Downtown), a medical services provider based in Buffalo, New York, received no fault claims from a number of corporations owned by one Valentina Anikeyeva, a licensed acupuncturist, in 2004.  The complaint alleged that the defendants had failed to demonstrate reasonable cause for their non-compliance in complying with the preclusion order, and that they had provided independent contractors to perform acupuncture services at the defendants' offices.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants attempted to avoid the consequences of the conditional order by serving responses about a month late which were \"evasive, unresponsive and consisting mostly of objections.\"  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2004, when Downtown was a party to a prior action finding that it was unlawfully incorporated, it failed to reimburse the defendants for assigned No-Fault benefits submitted under the prior action.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Downtown and other defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $914.33, prejudgment interest of $1,038.33 and a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced criminal charges against Downtown and its purported owner.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Golia and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office.
