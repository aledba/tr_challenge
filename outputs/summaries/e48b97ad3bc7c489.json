  "summary": "On March 21, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky entered a final judgment against the Fayette County Sheriff's Office and the Kentucky Department of Health and Family Services in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fayetteville, Kentucky, alleges that, on January 12, 2018, Mother was arrested and charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that Mother was not properly served in the underlying Juvenile Case when she was arrested, and that, throughout Mother's pregnancy, she had failed to complete any of the court-ordered drug screenings required to properly resolve her own warrant for a proper placement for a child. In addition, the complaint alleges that she was non-compliant with her substance abuse treatment at the Pathways program and had previously lost custody of her other children due to substance abuse concerns and failure to complete case plans required by the Cabinet. The court also ruled that, without service of process, Mother could not participate in the reunification process because she was under the influence of a substance abuse drug. The Court also found that, despite Mother\u2019s repeated requests for a continuance of the Termination Hearing, the Cabinet did not use reasonable efforts to reunite her with Child. The SEC alleges that the Cabinet violated its discretion in failing to provide reasonable efforts at the time of the termination hearing, and the court improperly ordered Mother to appear in person.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Mother consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains her parental rights to Child, permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related matter, the SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigation\u00c2\u00a0to\u00c2\u00a0find\u00c2\u00a0whether or not there is sufficient evidence to determine whether or not to terminate a parent's parental rights.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against Mother. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mother, Father, and Child against her. The investigation was conducted by Jennifer C. McKinley and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson"
