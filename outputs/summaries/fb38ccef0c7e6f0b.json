  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Pennsylvania yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of Adoptive Parents, Inc., a Pennsylvania-based nonprofit organization that seeks to adopt children.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that, in April of 2018, the court issued an order requiring the parties to sign a pre-adoption contact agreement (PACA) that included the provision that a neutral third party would be required to supervise the visits.

The SEC also prohibits Defendants from using the SEC as an unregistered broker or dealer to sell or offer to sell securities in the same securities.
