  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon today announced criminal charges against a former prison chaplain for his role in a scheme to manipulate the prison population.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, alleges that the Department of Corrections (DOC) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that DOC failed to comply with the relevant rulemaking provisions of Sections 183.400(1) and 183.402(2).  According to the complaint, the DOC policies that govern searches of inmates\u2019 dreadlocks and Native American medicine bags violated the federal securities laws, and the DOC rules that require the chaplain to administer the religious sincerity test are not subject to the formalities of rulemaking.  In addition, the complaint alleges that DOC did not comply with rulemaking procedures when it adopted a rule that prohibited inmates from participating in three-way calls or call forwarding.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, DOC has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the institution to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  Additionally, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and ordered DOC to provide an accounting of the amount of money that has been lost in the alleged scheme, as well as a civil injunctive relief order.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the above-mentioned provisions, and granted the institution the right to request a permanent injunction against future violations of these provisions. The court also granted the agency's request to appoint a receiver to determine whether to issue an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver. The receiver will determine the appropriate amount of funds to be distributed to the receiver, and will determine how to proceed with the receiver's investigation. The order appointing the receiver is subject to court approval.  For further information, see SEC v. OAR 291-143-0111(1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) Rules No. 206-1, (4), (5), (6), and (7) of Criminal Justice Reform, (8) Rules 206-2, (9) (11) (12) and 13) (13) (14) (15) (16) (20) (17) (18) (19) (23) ("
