  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a default judgment against Stone Mountain Roofing & Restoration, Inc., a Georgia-based company, and its owner, Lendr, LLC f/k/a Viking Funding Group, LLC.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas on November 14, 2017, Novik, a resident of Harris County, Texas, claimed that the Texas Secretary of State signed a \"Payment Rights Purchase and Sale Agreement\" (the \"Agreement\") and that he was entitled to receive a percentage of future sales or receipts from the company.  The complaint alleges that the agreement and the personal guaranty were signed in Harris County and performed in Texas, and that Novik was not given notice or citation personally.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  Novik also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Novik.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Insurance in this matter."
