  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maine today entered a final judgment against the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) for unlawfully withholding consent to the adoption of Paisley.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Maine, alleges that the DHS violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that, in violation of Section 9(a)(3), the Department acted unreasonably in withholding consent.  According to the complaint, the D.C. Attorney General's Office issued a case management and pretrial order on June 29, 2017, denying the agency's request for an emergency court order to expedite the application of the court's order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's case, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requiring the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  On June 30, the court granted the appellants' request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendants from further violating the securities laws and requires the parties to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court. The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  A hearing scheduled for July 5, 2017 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. EST. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 24, 2017)."
