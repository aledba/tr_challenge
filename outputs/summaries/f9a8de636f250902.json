  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of parents seeking to recover extraordinary expenses incurred to care for a disabled infant who, but for a physician's negligent failure to detect or advise on the risks of impairment, would not have been born.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, Dr. Alan Copperman learned that an egg donor had tested positive for the fragile X trait, a chromosomal abnormality that can result in intellectual disability and other deficits.  The complaint alleges that, after birth, the egg donor was implanted with fertilized embryos using the donor eggs, and the couple was discharged to their obstetrician/gynecologist within one year of the birth.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the limitations period began to run upon the birth of the child and did not last until the child could have reasonably discovered the malpractice.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced parallel criminal charges against the parents.  To settle the charges, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the assets of the defendants and imposing a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Becker of the New York Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Becker. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.N. Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the British Columbia Securities Commission, the Canadian Securities Inspection Agency, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority and the Swiss Securities and Exchange Commission."
