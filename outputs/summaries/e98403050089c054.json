  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Rowland Timber Co., Inc. and its insurer, National Fire & Marine Insurance Company, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on August 22, 2015, at about 7:40 a.m., a truckload driver in Tensas Parish, Louisiana lost control of his car due to mud on the road near a sugarcane operation.  According to the complaint, the driver, David R. Glover, was driving the truck when the accident occurred.  Glover allegedly attempted to pass the truck on the shoulder of the road and hit the front passenger side of Glover's truck, which was parked alongside the road.  Saldana's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, alleges that Glover violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Glover consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Glover and his company, Noland Trucking, LLC, on the issue of liability for Glover's actions, and ordered Noland and Noland to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 each.  Noland agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10\u00c2\u00a0b of the Exchange Act, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, and to pay a penalty of $20,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
