  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Town of Lake Arthur and its orthopedic surgeon in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on May 12, 2014, the Medical Director of a Louisiana-based health care company denied an employer's request for a second opinion for a lumbar work injury.  According to the complaint, the medical director's opinion was premature, as it contradicted Dr. McDonnell's recommendation, and the recommendation was not in accordance with the medical treatment schedule.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Dr. Boudreaux, a licensed clinical trial physician, failed to timely submit a medical opinion for the patient's condition.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's judgment, the employer and its medical director consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the payment of disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On December 19, 2018, the Commission issued its final judgment, which permanently enjoins the employer from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders the employer to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by David M. Basinger and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the SEC's New York Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's litigation will be led by Mr. Beringer and Ms. Karpel."
