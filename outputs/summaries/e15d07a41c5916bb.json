  "summary": "On July 29, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against various defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that defendant Kathy Mehalko filed a three-count complaint in July 2016 alleging defamation, violation of the pre-judgment provisions of Rule 219, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that, in an attempt to comply with the court's order, she created a new Facebook page, ostensibly administered by Doe's deceased mother-in-law, that revealed her identity as the person behind the alleged online harassment.  Mehalkowo also allegedly used the alias Justin Guy to post comments on her Facebook page revealing the name of Doe's mother in-law and her city of residence.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, charging them with violating Rule 219 and ordering them to pay $7,329.02 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On August 2, 2017, the court granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered them to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, to pay civil penalties, to be determined by the court at a later date, and to pay attorney fees and other expenses.   The court also issued an order requiring the defendants to provide depositions to confirm the accuracy of the information contained in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order to the court, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to disgorge their alleged illusory gains with interest, imposes civil penalties against them, and orders the destruction of evidence. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0instant.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and\u00c2\u00a0investors.gov users.\u00c2\u00a0In a related case, the SEC charged a defendant with defrauding investors by making false and misleading statements to investors in connection with an investment in a private company.
