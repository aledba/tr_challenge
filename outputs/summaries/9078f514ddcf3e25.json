  "summary": "On October 19, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of DG Trading, SBMH Group DMCC, and other non-signatory parties in an arbitration action brought by the United Arab Emirates.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that DG Trading and its principal, Steven Neiger, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, DG Trading consented to arbitration without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint. DG Trading agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins DG Trading from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and requires DG Trading to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United Kingdom's Attorney General announced criminal charges against DG Trading. The U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida today announced parallel criminal charges. The SEC also announced that it filed an emergency action in which it obtained an emergency court order freezing DG Trading's assets and ordering the asset freeze and other emergency relief. The court's order freezes the assets of the defendants, and prohibits them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David Neiger and Emma Hazzan of the SEC's Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Neiger. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of International Affairs. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Financial Conduct Authority in this matter."
