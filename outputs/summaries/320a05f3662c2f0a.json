  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a dispositional order against Ashley S. Kenny and her biological father, Vincent S. (Kenny), for failing to provide sufficient evidence to determine whether the children were at risk for harm.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Omaha, Nebraska, from November 2016 through February 2017, Kenny and Ashley S., who are the biological parents of Lilly S., Vincent S., and Vincent, were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 43-247(3)(a) of the Nebraska Juvenile Code. The complaint alleges that the court improperly took judicial notice of the issues raised in the complaint and entered dispositional orders without providing notice or a reasonable opportunity to be heard.  The complaint further alleges that, in reality, the court observed the witnesses and accepted one version of the facts and used it as evidence to support the children\u2019s claims.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Ashley had continued to allow Kenny to supervise the children despite knowing he \u201cabuses methamphetamines and amphetamines\u201d; that she engages in domestic violence with Kenny and has failed to provide proper parental care, support, or supervision for the children; and that, as a result of this conduct, Kenny was denied due process of law when the court entered dispositions and dispositions as to the children in separate proceedings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Kenny has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the Division of Enforcement's Office of Child Advocacy and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and Ms. Berger and supervised by Amy Gwiazda. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Division of Child and Family Education."
