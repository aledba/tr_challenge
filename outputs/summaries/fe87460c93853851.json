  "summary": "On April 6, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama entered a temporary restraining order against two Alabama-based abortion providers, Scott Harris and Yashica Robinson, who are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that Harris and Robinson violated the federal anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws by issuing a series of emergency orders that delayed or delayed abortions.  According to the complaint, the defendants misrepresented to the court that the emergency orders were designed to protect the life and health of the mother, not delay an abortion.  Instead, as the complaint alleges, the emergency order imposed the restrictions on medical procedures and related restrictions.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to consider that, as a reasonable medical judgment, a delay in obtaining an abortion does not erase even the patient's short-term need for medical care.  For instance, the SEC alleges that, in a parallel action, the Alabama Department of Public Health issued an emergency health order suspending certain clinics and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against the defendants.  On April 3, the court granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval, and granted the defendants' motion for a final judgment ordering a permanent injunction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  Additionally, the order requires the defendants to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requires the providers to pay civil penalties of $50,000 and $100,000, respectively, in the amount of $1,000 each, for a total of $2,500, which represents a substantial burden on the providers and the public to comply with the court's order.

The court also granted the state's motion for an emergency court order against Harris, ordering him to sign a cease-and-desist order, ordering the cancellation of all scheduled abortions, and ordering the destruction of any evidence that may have been obtained in connection with the alleged violations of the anti-abortion provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b) of"
