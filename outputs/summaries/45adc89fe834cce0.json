  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against San Diego County, California, and San Bernardino County, Calif., on the basis of a finding that the city lacked standing to challenge the validity of a municipal bond transaction.  The court's order, which was entered on May 18, 2015, found that San Diego had standing to bring a civil action under Section 1090 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Bernardino, California on March 17, 2015 and unsealed on May 19, 2016, the court held that the City of San Diego and Public Facilities Financing Authority (PFFA) had standing under Sections 1090 and 1092 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, San Diego consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the city from violating these provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of any disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Southern California today announced criminal charges against the city of San Bernardino and PFFA for their roles in the issuance of the bonds.  San Bernardino also agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the city to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $50,000, respectively, to the parties to a public contract, and ordering the issuance and sale of bonds subject to a court-ordered injunction.  On May 20, 2017, the San Bernardino District Court entered a judgment against the defendants, finding that San Bernardino had standing as a party to the bond transaction, that it lacked standing as an independent party, and that it had no discretion with respect to whether to seek relief under section 1090.  It also ordered the city not to violate Section 526a, which requires that a public agency or a member of its governing body be required to show that it has a duty to act in a fair, just and equitable manner when it is required to do so, and to impose a civil monetary penalty of $150,000. The court also ordered San Bernardino to comply with a court order requiring it to provide a copy of the final judgment, which is subject to approval by the court.
