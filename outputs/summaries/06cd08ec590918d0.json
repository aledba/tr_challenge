  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment in favor of a Texas-based insurance company in a civil injunctive action brought by a jury in 2015.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that American National Insurance Company (A.N.C.) violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing when it failed to pay Holland's extracontractual claims.  According to the complaint, American National falsely claimed that Holland was making a claim for both PIP and UIM benefits when, in fact, she was not.  In fact, the complaint alleges that the jury found that the insurer had no duty to pay the PIP benefits and that Holland did not intend to make a PIP or UIM claim at the time of the alleged failure to pay them.   The complaint further alleges that, based on the jury's findings, American N.C. violated its duty of fair dealing by failing to timely acknowledge Holland's claims and failing to reimburse her for her medical expenses under her PIP coverage. \u00c2\u00a0   In its second and third issues, the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) and the Texas Secretary of State's Office issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can quickly and easily check whether their investments are being used to fund their retirement savings by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website to quickly and accurately identify whether their investment is being evaluated.\u00c2\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Enforcement Division's Fort Worth Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York."
