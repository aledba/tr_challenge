  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment in favor of the Virginia Attorney General's Office's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that Sarah Flanders, a Virginia resident, intentionally drove a red Dodge Durango into a school parking lot, causing the victim to lose consciousness, and then driving away from the scene.  According to the complaint, Flanders and her husband, Rick Pentz, stole a car one day, then struck and killed a pedestrian while leaving the scene the next day. The complaint alleges that Flanders drove the Durango and intentionally caused the victim's death by causing the car to roll over.  In a parallel action, the Virginia Secretary of State's Office today announced criminal charges against Flanders for her role in the alleged scheme.  Flanders has agreed to settle the SEC's charges against her by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, a $50,000 civil penalty, and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order.  To learn more about felony homicide, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Virginia Department of Justice in this matter."
