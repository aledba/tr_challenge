  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of multiple counts of felony child molestation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on December 30, 2013, a prison counselor was attacked and severely beaten, resulting in severe memory loss.  According to the complaint, Glenda Hudspeth, who was the counselor's wife, told her husband that defendant had abused her and told her that he planned to turn himself in to the authorities.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, that Glenda had no memory of the alleged abuse, and that she did not remember telling her husband about it.  Glenda also allegedly claimed that, when confronted by officers, defendant had admitted to having sexual contact with her during the course of the day.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant told Glenda that he had been \"on chemotherapy for almost two years before these charges arose.\"  The complaint further alleges that when Glenda confronted defendant, defendant replied that he \"couldn't tell you if it was true or false.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Glenda.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Kathleen M. Burns of the U.N. Division of Justice issued an order suspending Glenda from appearing before the court as a witness under the \"Confrontation Clause\" of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Glenda to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission v. Davis, the Court granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of Glenda's assets and liabilities, and ordered her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2,500.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Stincer and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigation\u00c2\u00a0to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to determine whether to charge Glenda with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933.\u00c2\u00a0"
