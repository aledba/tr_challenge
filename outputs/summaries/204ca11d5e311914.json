  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Joseph Poignant, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 10 months and 20 years of supervised release in 2003 for failing to participate in a sex offender treatment program. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, Poignant agreed to a three-part plan that included: (1) avoiding risky areas like beaches and bars, avoid adult or child pornography, and employ a third-step strategy to control his anger. (2) He agreed to attend two group sessions every week, attend two individual sessions every month, and present exercises or assignments at group sessions each week. (3) He also agreed not to use a computer or use an external modem without the prior approval of his probation officer. (4) The complaint alleges that Poignant was warned that failing to follow his ITP contract could result in his discharge from the program. (5) Poignant failed to comply with the requirements of the program, and he was subsequently discharged from the treatment program for not participating as required by the federal court's judgment. (6) The court also found that in several ways Poignant did not participate in the sex offender program because he failed to participate. (7) He failed to show any clear error in the district court\u2019s findings when it relied on it, and (8) he did not respond to repeated requests to leave the room. (9) He did not comply with a written consent order and, 10 years later, was later released from prison. (10) The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York Office of Inspector General in this matter.  The SEC encourages the public to check the background of anyone who has been convicted of a felony by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an Investor.gov website\u00c2\u00a0in order to detect signs of fraud and to quickly identify people who may be at risk of being targeted by investment fraud."
