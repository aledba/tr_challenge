  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against William Shine, a trustee of a revocable trust, for defrauding the trust and its charitable beneficiaries.  The court found that Shine violated the antifraud provisions of the trust, and ordered him to pay $1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  According to the court's order, Shine also violated the trust\u2019s indemnity provisions, which require trustees to pay attorney fees in the event of an emergency.  In addition, the court ruled that Shine failed to adequately account for expenses and income in the trust or maintain written records of his actions as trustee.  As alleged in the complaint, Shine was not entitled to indemnity for fees incurred in an unsuccessful defense of a trust amendment and instead relied on the advice of an attorney to delay funding the trust.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, Shine consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interests, pay civil penalties, and pay a $100,000 civil penalty in the amount of $800,000.  Shine also agreed to be permanently enjoined from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any securities in the public company.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17 (2014).
