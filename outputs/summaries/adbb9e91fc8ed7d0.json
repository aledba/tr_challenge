  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Jason Timothy Link for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 12, 2017, Link was stopped for allegedly running a stop sign at the intersection of Polk Hollow Road and US-50 in Ross County, Ohio.  The complaint alleges that Link failed to stop at the stop sign and instead continued to drive past it.  As alleged in the complaint, Link's stop sign was not properly placed and he failed to yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against Link.  On May 13, 2018, a federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, entered a judgment against Link that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Link to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his civil penalty.  Link has consented to the entry of the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mascianica of the Chicago Regional Office, and is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Department of State Highway Patrol, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio State Department of Transportation."
