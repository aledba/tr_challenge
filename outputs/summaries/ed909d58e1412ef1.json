  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against a Maryland-based businessman who obtained a default judgment against his brother.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, alleges that the clerk entered a judgment on the docket of a federal court on June 2, 2016, that was not entered as required under Maryland Rule 2-601(b)(2) and that the date of entry of the judgment was not consistent with the date that the court entered the judgment.  According to the complaint, the clerk also entered a hearing sheet on June 3, 2016 that did not reflect the date when the judgment had been entered.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the judge entered a separate judgment on July 6, 2016 without providing a clear indication of when a judgment was entered, and did not trigger the thirty-day appeal period set forth in Maryland Rule 8-202(a).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On May 14, 2019, the court granted a temporary restraining order and issued an order temporarily restraining the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendant to pay disgorgement of $141,059.44, plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $250,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that satisfied the requirements of the federal securities laws, and the judge granted the clerk's motion to vacate the judgment without prejudice.   The court also granted the defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered the clerk to enter the judgment on a separate docket, and directed the clerk not to record or index the judgment in the court's order, and to provide a copy of the final judgment for the court to determine whether to grant the motion for an injunction.  Finally, the Court of Special Appeals granted the motion to dismiss without prejudice to the relief sought by the relief defendant in the Complaint.  As to the timing of the filing of the Judgment, the SEC has not yet determined whether it is timely or premature.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17, Litigation Bulletin No. 206-1-17 (January 11, 2016).  The Commission of Inspections and Examinations has issued a Complaint Bulletin on July 24, 2017, which includes an order requiring the clerk enter a judgment within 30 days of the date the judgment is entered."
