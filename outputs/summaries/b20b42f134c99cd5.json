  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California yesterday entered summary judgment against Enterprise Rent-A-Car and its affiliates for liability for an automobile accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Joaquin County, California, alleges that, from 1992 through 2003, Enterprise was liable as a successor to a company that had purchased, for adequate consideration, a fertility drug distribution business from General Motors Corporation.  According to the complaint, in 2003, when the car rental business was acquired by New NCRS, it was strictly liable for product defects in the 1992 Oldsmobile that later came to be involved in a car accident. The complaint further alleges that in 2004, when New NCR went into bankruptcy, Enterprise assumed strict liability for the product defects that later resulted in the car's demise.  In addition, the complaint alleges that after the sale of the business, the new NCRS subsidiary was liable for the same product defect that had caused Hernandez's injuries.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Enterprise consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of any civil penalty that will be imposed by the court upon the parties.   The court also granted summary judgment in a related action brought by the SEC in July 2017 against a third defendant, Cerberus Capital Management L.P., for liability arising out of a product defect in a rental car business owned by a former car rental company. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the California Department of Insurance in this matter."
