Code, \u00a7 288.7, subd. (a)).  The court also found that Morales violated the \"quotable statement\" provision of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, Morales consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of $5,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  The judgment also prohibits Morales from associating with any law enforcement officer, and prohibits him from participating in any officer-on-officer conduct.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Morales.  Among other things, the court found Morales guilty on all of the charges and ordered him to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rules 206(3)-8 thereunder, and ordered Morales to pay a $40,000 civil penalty.
