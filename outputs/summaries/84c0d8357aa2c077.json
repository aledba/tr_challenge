  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Alaska today announced that it has obtained a court order to revoke the probation of Roy F. Silas, a convicted sex offender who was sentenced to probation for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alaska, alleges that Silas violated his probation by failing to participate in sex offender treatment.  According to the complaint, Silas's probation officer, his treatment supervisor, and his mental health provider all denied that they had ever prohibited Silas from participating in the treatment program.  Silas also allegedly told the court that he had engaged in acts of domestic violence during his probation, and that his probation officer had prohibited him from socializing with his romantic partner, Patsy Schreiber, the mother of his children.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the probation provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders Silas to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today issued a temporary restraining order against Silas and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Kerstetter of the U. S. District Court in the Southern Division issued a final order permanently enjoining the defendants from violating their probation and ordering them to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $100,000, respectively, for violations of the probation provision of Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2)(A) and (3)(B)(3) and of the Department of Justice's supervision of Silas.   The court also issued an order temporarily suspending the defendants' right to reapply after five years of probation, which is subject to court approval.  Last week, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, and an order requiring the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay for a conduct-based administrative proceeding.  This matter was investigated by the Office of Inspector General's Criminal Justice, which has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Surveillance Alert\u00c2\u00a0to detect suspicious patterns of criminal activity. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
