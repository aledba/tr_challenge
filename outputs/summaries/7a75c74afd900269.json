  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Andrew Sullo, a Houston attorney and partner, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that, from at least January 2012 through August 2013, Sullos and Zimmerman engaged in mail fraud, wire fraud, and other securities law violations.  According to the complaint, the Kuboshes allegedly solicited and received hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal sales of bonds and services in violation of the federal securities laws, including the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) and (a)(4) and of the securities laws.  They also alleged that, in connection with their solicitation of the Carter parties' traffic tickets and warrants, they used the telephone and electronic communications to solicit, file, and maintain the Carter party's claims against them.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Kubo parties used the telemarketers to solicit and solicit new clients for their traffic tickets, and that they engaged in wire fraud and common law fraud, both of which were covered by the SEC's Complaint Bulletin.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged provisions, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $10,000, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $50,000.  SULLo and Zimmerman agreed to settle the case against them by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, orders them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains, and requires them to provide for a conduct-based injunction against future violations. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 29, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Conrrad of the United States District Court in Houston granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and ordered the parties to pay civil penalties in the amount of $20,000 each.  A hearing on May 30, 2017 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. for the Kubosh defendants.   The court also granted the parties' request for a temporary restraining order, a temporary asset freeze, and a temporary officer-and-director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor"
