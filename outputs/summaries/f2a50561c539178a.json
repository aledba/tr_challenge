  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered summary judgment against a former prison inmate for his alleged role in a long-running opioid addiction.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that, in 1971, Brennan was hit by a truck while riding a bicycle and fell on a waxed concrete floor. As alleged in the complaint, Brennan suffered severe injuries on both his legs and one of his hips, requiring several surgeries. The complaint alleges that Brennan repeatedly refused to let a doctor or a specialist see him, refused to prescribe him pain medication, and refused to physically examine him beyond laying \u201cone finger\u201d on his neck and lower back. Brennan also allegedly complained to a certified registered nurse practitioner that he was being put on opioids in response to a patient\u2019s complaints of severe back pain. According to the SEC, Brennan ultimately received surgery to repair his damaged lumbar discs. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Central District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Brennan. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Brennan, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans."
