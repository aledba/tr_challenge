  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Montana today entered a final judgment against a former employee of the Billings Clinic for lying in an internal investigation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Montana, alleges that Ronis Bollinger, a registered nurse with over 40 years of experience, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that she was improperly terminated for lying during the Clinic\u2019s internal investigation into the matter.  According to the complaint, Bollinger lied to the Clinic about removing the schedule from the Clinic, which she believed was protected by attorney-client privilege and attorney work-product doctrine.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Bollinger told the Clinic that she would guard and treat as confidential all information pertaining to patients, she would access patient information only on a need-to-know-for-job-function basis, and the Clinic could discipline or discharge her if she did not comply with this policy.  Bollinger also alleges that the Clinic failed to inform her employer of the potential impact of her lying on its internal investigation, which was conducted by Ellen James, a former Clinic employee, and was supervised by the Clinic's Director of Health and Human Services.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay disgorgement of $9,370.59 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038.59 and a civil penalty of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment in a real estate development project.\u00c2\u00a0On January 24, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint against the Clinic for violating the anti-fraud provision of the Act and ordering Bollinger to comply with the Commission's order.  On February 2, 2019, the Commission issued an Order suspending Bollinger from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an attorney and ordering her to return to her duties as a registered representative.  It also issued an order requiring the Clinic to produce approximately 600 emails related to the possible privacy breach, including one from Bollinger's attorney, which the Commission found to be relevant to its investigation of the alleged privacy breach. The Commission also issued a Final Agency Decision affirming the Commission"
