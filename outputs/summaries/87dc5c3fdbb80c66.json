  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Dillingham on consent for his participation in the distribution of child pornography.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least June 2016 through August 2016, the defendant accessed the Pirate Bay website and used a tool called uTorrent to search for and download child pornography from the internet. According to the complaint, the tool provided by the defendant was designed to detect the presence of images of children in the torrent files.
