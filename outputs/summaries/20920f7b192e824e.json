  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against West Covina Auto Group, LLC (\"WCT\"), a California-based car dealership, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, WCT violated the right to arbitration provisions of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that WCT failed to comply with WCT's request for a court order requiring it to impose a class-wide arbitration provision.  WCT also failed to inform the court that the arbitration provision was unenforceable and that it could not be enforced.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against WCT.  On May 11, 2011, the court granted WCT a temporary restraining order and ordered it to return to court on June 10, 2011.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Additionally, the judgment orders WCT to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which will be determined by the court upon motion by the parties.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Marc J. Ricchiute. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
