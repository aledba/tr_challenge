  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against Hillel at the George Washington University campus, finding that it failed to meet the requirements of the federal government for variance relief.  According to the court's order, filed on March 27, 2014, the university filed an application for a variance and special exception relief, which would allow it to construct a new campus religious building.  The court found that the university failed to satisfy the criteria for obtaining variance relief, and that it had to forgo development on another of its sites covered by the Zoning Commission's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the college consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the university from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the university to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  In its order, the court also granted the university's request for an area variance, which is subject to approval by the court, for a total area of 4,575 square feet, including the right to build a new building. The court also issued an order requiring the college to comply with the federal requirements for a \"special exception\" for the building, requiring that the college provide an auditorium and a dining hall, and requiring the school to provide an \"accommodatory\" dining area.  On June 5, 2015, the Court issued an Order approving the college's application for variance and granting the university an exemption from violating these provisions. The Commission's Order also requires the college and its affiliated entities to submit a plan for the construction of a new facility. The college and affiliated entities have agreed to the issuance of the Order, which requires each of them to submit an application to the Commission. The SEC's Order requires each entity to provide a copy of the Commission's findings and conclusions, which are subject to court approval.  For example, St. Mary's and WECA have each submitted a written statement in which they affirmatively agreed that the Commission violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-1 thereunder. The university has also agreed to a $100,000 civil penalty for violations of Section 5(b).  The college has agreed to pay $75,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 penalty.  WECA agreed to settle the SEC's case by consenting to a judgment that imposes a permanent injunction, prohibits the college from destroying any evidence, and requires the university"
