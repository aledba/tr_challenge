  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against Stacy Tyrone Johnson, Jr., a former Lake Charles City Police officer who was convicted of second-degree murder in June 2016.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, Johnson, who was a resident of Calcasieu Parish at the time of the June 5, 2016, car accident that left one African American man dead, allegedly engaged in an armed robbery, and engaged in a fake shooting.  The complaint alleges that Johnson and two other individuals, T.Z. and J.L., were among the first to witness the carjacking, and Johnson and his brother, Robert Colston, were the next to witness it.  Johnson and Colston later told the court that they had observed a man with a gun on the day of the shooting, and that he had been in the area when he was shot.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the video and other evidence presented to the trial court did not support the defendants' claims that the defendant had engaged in the attempted armed robbery.  In fact, the complaint alleges, the jury found that Johnson had been shot multiple times during the course of the alleged armed robbery and failed to consider the specific nature of the crime.  Instead, the court found Johnson liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Johnson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  He also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any security or other security measure.  On June 18, 2020, the Court granted Johnson's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered Johnson to comply with the court's order by issuing an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott L. Gibson, John R. Rymas, and Paul G. Sansone of the Chicago Regional Office, with the assistance of the Office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Mississippi. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and supervised by"
