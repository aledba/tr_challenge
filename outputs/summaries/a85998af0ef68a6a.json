  "summary": "On May 8, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found not disabled by the court.  The court entered a temporary restraining order on May 9, 2018, freezing the defendant's assets and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in New York, Jake R. was born with congenital hydrocephalus, a rare condition in which the primary characteristic is excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain.  To determine whether a claimant is disabled, the court has to determine whether the claimant is capable of performing simple routine tasks, such as grocery shopping, cleaning, and housework.  In a parallel action, on September 5, 2017, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant.   The SEC's complaint alleges that the defendant was not disabled when, in fact, he was suffering from severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, short-term memory loss, and a history of substance abuse.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendant had a shunt surgically installed in his skull since he was eight months old, which drains fluid into the brain and causes him to have severe headaches and to have difficulty controlling his thoughts and actions.  He also had a severe headache, which caused him to get into fights at school over teasing, to lose a job, and even to have his mother seek police assistance in 2016 for his \"extreme behavior.\"  The complaint also alleges that defendant had difficulty with executive functioning and controlling anger, which is consistent with the medical evidence in the record.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (\"Advisers\").  The settlement is subject to court approval.
