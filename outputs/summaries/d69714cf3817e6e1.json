  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Hawai'i today entered a final judgment against Hawaii Electric Company, Inc., a Hawaii-based nonprofit organization that seeks to participate in a contested power purchase agreement (PPA) between the state and private companies.  The court found that, in 2012, the PUC approved the PPA without requiring a contested case hearing.  According to the court's order, the company failed to adequately consider GHG emissions related to its purchase and operation of a biomass power plant.  In addition, the court also found that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it failed to comply with the relevant agency rules.    In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Hawaii, charges Hawaii Electric with violations of Section 269 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hawaii Electric and its affiliated entities have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordering the company to pay a penalty equal to the amount of its profits.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge William J. Ostrove of the U.K. Division of Justice granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants from participating in any future contested case proceeding.
