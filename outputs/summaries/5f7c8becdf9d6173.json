  "summary": "On May 17, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against two towing companies, B&C Towing, Inc. and Nick's Towing Services, Inc., for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Newark, New Jersey, defendants agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The complaint alleges that defendants charged $290.85 for the non-consensual tow of a vehicle at the direction of a municipal towing company, and $35.00 for a private property towing service not listed on the schedule of services for which a certain fee may be charged as established by the director.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants charged more than $448.36 for the private property and related storage services that were not covered by the department's schedule.  In addition, the complaint alleged that defendants failed to establish a reasonable basis for charging the fees, which were outside the scope of the director's schedule, when the department had a duty to tow the vehicle.  Finally, the court found that defendants were not entitled to derivative immunity under the federal securities laws because they had no meaningful opportunity to withhold consent from the government.  As a result of the court's order, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On May 24, 2018 the UJ District Court in Newark entered a judgment ordering the SEC to conduct a preliminary examination of certain of the proposed amendments to the Towing Act. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Timothy J. Burt and Glenn S. Gordon. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Department of Transportation, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
