  "summary": "On May 18, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York entered a final judgment against Saint-Gobain Corporation, a Pennsylvania-based manufacturer and supplier of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) into the Village of Hoosick Falls's drinking supply.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, New York, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC alleges that, in violation of Section 8(e) and Rule 8b-3, defendants failed to show sufficient evidence to establish jurisdiction over the defendants.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants knew or should have known that PFOA was present in the Village's water supply and the nexus of that contamination was at the source of the contamination.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants have consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $1,000,000 and a $100,000 each.  On May 19, 2020, the Honorable Daniel J. Stewart of the New York District Court granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The Commission's order also prohibits defendants from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer or dealer in a securities law case, and bars defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, other than for the purpose of acquiring or selling a security deposit in a public company.  It also orders the Commission to provide a copy of the Complaint to the Commission for its examination and determination by the Court upon motion of the Commission.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-CV-1378, No. 13-cv-10, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. March 9, 2006).  In a related matter, the Commission has issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether a defendant is subject to the jurisdiction of a federal court, ordering the receiver to send a copy to the receiver, and to provide an accounting of the company's assets and liabilities. The Commission has also issued a subpoena for the receiver. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted"
