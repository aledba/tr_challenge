  "summary": "On June 26, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri entered a final judgment against Missouri-based lobbyist Ronald Calzone for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Calzone has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in St. Louis, Missouri, alleges that Calzone violated the First Amendment by failing to register as a lobbyist with the SEC and by not making any expenditures in connection with his advocacy. According to the complaint, Calzone also violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) and (a)(4) of Missouri's Securities Act of 1933. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 5(b), Calzone is a \"legislative lobbyist\" because he does not spend or receive money for his advocacy, nor does he spend money on legislators and legislative staff when he communicates with them about his public policy beliefs. In addition, the complaint charges Calzone with violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 17(b)(2)(A) of The Securities Act and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
