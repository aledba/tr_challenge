  "summary": "On April 25, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against a defendant and his company, Centro Medico Del Turabo, Inc. d/b/a HIMA San Pablo Caguas, to prevent the discovery of an unsigned draft of an expert's report recently amended.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York City, Dr. Gebel, a vascular neurologist, presented his draft report to a deposition of his expert on February 12, 2018.  The complaint alleges that while the deposition was taking place, Gebell's draft report was involuntarily produced, together with the other draft reports.  As alleged in the complaint, this was an inadvertent production made at the beginning of the deposition, when the undersigned was busy inspecting other documents.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced that it filed an emergency action and obtained an emergency court order to hold a hearing on the matter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil money penalties, and officer-and-director and penny stock bars. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Marc Blau of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Office of Inspector General, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
