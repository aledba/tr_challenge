  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against two former Lloyd Industries employees for their roles in an alleged insider trading scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in November 2014, Lloyd Industries, Inc. and its former plant manager, Mr. Matthew Spillane, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants engaged in a protected activity by taking pictures of the machine involved in Mr. Elbode's injury and providing information to OSHA inspectors who wanted to inspect the plant.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to establish a sufficient basis for the termination because they did not know or believe that the employee engaged in the protected activity.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  On March 29, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Spillanes and Sanna, charging them with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  In a parallel action, on April 2, 2020, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the Federal Bureau of Investigation entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15a-1 and Rule 15b2-2 thereunder, ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $822,000, and ordering the company to pay an officer and director bar and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.  Separately, the court granted the company's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations, and the company agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Thompson, Kelly L. Gibson, and Patrick J. McCluskey of the Philadelphia Regional Office, with assistance from John R. Rymas of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson and Ms. Gibson."
