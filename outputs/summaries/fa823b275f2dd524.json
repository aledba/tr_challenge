  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont today entered a final judgment against Binnacle Capital Services LLC and Wind Gap Farm LLC in a class action action brought by a former registered nurse.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston on May 16, 2016, Binnacle hired a registered nurse to perform home healthcare services as a Registered Nurse.  The complaint alleges that Binnacle agreed to pay $50.00 per hour for her services and was never paid overtime.  As alleged in the complaint, the complaint further alleges that when Wind Gap presented her with the arbitration agreement, it implicitly, if not explicitly, threated that if she did not sign the contract, she would not be scheduled to work any further and most importantly would be paid for reimbursable expenses that Wind Gap already owed her.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against one of Binnacle's former registered nurses.  Binnacle has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, B&r;s has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering it to be entered into a permanent injunction, and ordering the payment of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On May 17, 2017, the court entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants, freezing their assets, and imposing a $1,000,000 civil penalty.  A hearing on June 5, 2018, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.   The SEC&rquo:  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Williston and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Messrs. Welshhans and Klotzbach. \u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office, and the Vermont Attorney General's Office in this matter."
