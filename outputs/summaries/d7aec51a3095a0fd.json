  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico today entered a final judgment against Victor Mercedes-Guerrero, a convicted drug smuggler, agreeing to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Puerto Rico, alleges that, on April 24, 2015, a federal grand jury found that a defendant who was hired to transport 72.5 kilograms of cocaine into the United States illegally was not substantially less culpable than those involved in a broader drug-smuggling enterprise.

Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mercedes.  This action is the latest in a series of actions by the SEC against defendants who have violated the federal securities laws, including the issuance of a cease-and-desist order, and the appointment of a receiver.  On May 21, 2016, the federal district court in New York issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering Mercedes to comply with the court's order, which requires her to surrender her passport in the event of an emergency.  A hearing on May 24, 2016 was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. EST.  To determine whether to grant a minor participant reduction, the SEC requested that the court consider the defendant's background, studying his file, analyzing the arguments presented by defense counsel, and hearing defendant's consented opinion before it issued the order.
