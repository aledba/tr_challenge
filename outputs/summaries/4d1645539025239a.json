  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of two counts of sexual battery of a child under thirteen in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on January 24, 2014, a Kenner Police Department officer confronted a defendant in the front seat of a patrol car with allegations that he had engaged in a long-running pattern of sexually aggressive conduct. According to the complaint, the officer told the defendant that he would like to make a statement, but that he did not want to do so. The complaint alleges that defendant agreed to the officer's recommendation, without admitting or denying the allegations, that he should be sentenced to a minimum of fifty years without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. The court also found that defendant had no prior criminal history, had no previous felony convictions, and had the mental age of a five-year-old when he committed the alleged crime. The SEC alleges that the officer also told defendant not to tell anyone, because it was a \"secret.\" The complaint further alleges that after learning of the alleged misconduct by the officer, defendant changed his mind and said he wished to speak with the officer without a lawyer present. The defendant also allegedly told the officer that he \"had demons and, you know, I did something.\"  The court's order against the officer who allegedly violated the Miranda provisions of the federal securities laws prohibits the officer from imposing a penalty higher than the statutory maximum.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On December 19, 2013, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the officer to conduct a conduct-based examination of the defendant's background. The examination that led to the order was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the New Orleans Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The Court appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, and the New Jersey Department of Criminal Justice."
