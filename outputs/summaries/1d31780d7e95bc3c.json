  "summary": "On August 23, 2018, a U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama entered a final judgment against Gregory Blane Laakkonen, Jr., who pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance and was sentenced to 24 months' confinement in the Madison County jail.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Ala., alleges that, in 2013, the Alabama Department of Corrections issued a presumptive and voluntary sentencing standards for Class D felonies.  According to the complaint, the presumptive sentencing standards provided by the Alabama Sentencing Commission required defendants to be informed of the presumptive and mandatory sentencing ranges when sentencing for a Class D felony.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants with prior felony convictions could be sentenced to a presumptive sentence range of 15 to 97 months on a straight sentence or 8 to 27 months in a pretrial diversion program.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the pre-judgment provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $7,500, and requiring them to repay their ill-gotten gains with interest.  On August 24, the court entered a written sentencing order that permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the mandatory sentencing standards and orders them to comply with the court's order.   The court also ordered the defendants to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and a $10,000 officer-and-director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Gordon and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Office of Inspector General in this matter."
