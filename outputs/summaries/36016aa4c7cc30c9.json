  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama today entered a final judgment against Security Engineers Inc.'s (SEI) motion to dismiss a civil injunctive action filed in federal court in Jefferson County, Alabama.  The SEC's complaint, filed on November 14, 2017, alleges that SEI, as her employer, subjected Jenkins to sexual harassment, a hostile work environment, and retaliation, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as age discrimination. The complaint also alleges that Jenkins failed to comply with SEI\u2019s requests for discovery responses by the requested deadlines of August 8, August 1, and November 2, 2018, and failed to provide complete responses to its requests for production and initial disclosures by August 16, 2018. The SEC further alleges that, despite repeated requests from SEI to respond to its discovery requests, Jenkins did not comply with the court orders and, instead, failed to timely file a brief or appendix to the complaint.  Finally, the complaint alleges that the district court improperly granted Jenkins\u2019 request for an extension of the discovery deadline, which was previously granted by the court.  In its order, the court granted Jenkins a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against her from participating in discovery. The court also issued an order requiring Jenkins to provide a copy of her expert witness report to SEI and to provide an accounting of her experience.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, SEI consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against Jenkins. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Separately, the SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Office of Inspector General, and the Alabama Department of Criminal Justice."
