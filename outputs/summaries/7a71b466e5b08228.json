  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment in favor of the Missouri Petroleum Storage Tank Insurance Fund, which provides insurance to service station owners for the cleanup costs associated with spills and leaks from underground petroleum storage tanks.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, alleges that, in 2003, Williams Travel Centers, Inc. purchased a service station located in Higginsville, Missouri from Williams Travel and was issued a Participation Agreement with coverage for the purpose of cleaning up a petroleum spill at the service station. According to the complaint, the Partnership Agreement required the Board to enter into contracts with fund participants to recover costs previously reimbursed from the fund. The complaint alleges that the Board was not required to participate in any contracts with Fund participants. Instead, the complaint alleges, the Board received a judgment that permanently enjoins the Board from violating Section 319.129.4 of the federal securities laws and requires it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $723,932.20. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Williams has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 319 and ordering it to comply with the court's order. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Williams Travel. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  To learn more about indemnity, see Investor.gov."
