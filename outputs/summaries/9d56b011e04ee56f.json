  "summary": "On May 24, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Ohio entered a final judgment in favor of Arnold Black, a former East Cleveland Police Detective, on his claims for malicious prosecution, abuse of process, battery, false imprisonment, and other violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, Black filed an answer and a cross-claim on May 9, 2012, alleging that defendants arrested him without probable cause and used excessive force in doing so.  Black also alleged that the trial court issued orders and conducted a jury trial on May 25, 2016.  The court also issued orders requiring defendants to respond to the discovery requests on or before May 2, 2016 and to show cause why they failed to produce during discovery.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed an emergency action against Black and his co-defendants, Randy Hicks and Jonathan O'Leary, for failing to comply with a court order to conduct an ex parte jury trial.  As alleged in the SEC's complaint, Hicks was not acting as an agent of the East Cleveland police department on April 28, 2012.  On May 31, 2014, a jury found Black liable for violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act by failing to timely respond to Black's and Hicks's requests for an asset freeze and other emergency relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Black consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay $10 million in disgorgement, $12,000 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $11,000,000.  Hicks agreed to settle the case by consenting to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and ordered to pay a $20,000 civil penalty and a $10,000 officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 104912, 2017."
