  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming today entered a final judgment against Duane Lester Jackson, Jr., a Wyoming man charged with three counts of first-degree sexual abuse of a minor.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Jackson's home state of Wyoming, Jackson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of the invited error doctrine, Jackson waived his right to review the jury instructions and verdict form in order to determine whether he was entitled to a fair trial.  As alleged in the complaint, Jackson also failed to show that he was capable of performing the alleged sexual intrusion by means of \"for the purposes of sexual arousal, gratification or abuse.\"  The SEC also alleges that Jackson failed to disclose to trial counsel that he had engaged in a pattern of misconduct that led to his suspension from appearing or practicing before the court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jackson arising from the same conduct alleged in this complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Jackson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Jackson also agreed to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the sale or purchase of any security, including the right to reapply after five years in prison.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David M. Dickeson, John R. Rymas, and Glenn S. Gordon of the Denver Regional Office, with assistance from Eric R. Werner of the Division of Criminal Justice's Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Foltz and Ms. Gordon. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wyoming State Attorney General's Office, and the Wyoming Office of Criminal Investigations."
