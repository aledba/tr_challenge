  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a former federal agent for his role in a scheme to illegally ship guns and ammunition to Haiti.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that former agent Stephen J. Barborini, of Jacksonville, Florida, attempted to deliver a container carrying firearms and ammunition from the Port of Palm Beach to Haiti without providing written notice to the shipping company. According to the complaint, after being questioned by federal agents about the value of the guns in Haiti, he allegedly claimed that he had recently purchased two guns within a five-day period and that the guns were worth double to quadruple the U. S. purchase price and the ammunition was worth more as well. The complaint further alleges that, contrary to representations made to the court, Barborinis was unqualified to ship the guns to Haiti because his knowledge was stale and based on hearsay.  In a parallel action, on May 27, 2015, a federal district court in Miami, Florida issued a temporary restraining order, freezing all assets in the United States, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty. The court also issued an order freezing the assets of the company and prohibiting them from being used as an unregistered broker, dealer, or transfer agent.  On June 5, 2016, the U-S District Court for New York entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $25,000, and a civil penalty of $50,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains and pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Haitian authorities in this matter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Haitian Ministry of Foreign Affairs."
