  "summary": "On October 24, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against the Federal Election Commission (\"FEC\") for improperly disposing of an administrative complaint filed by the agency in 2015.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., alleges that the Commission improperly disposed of a complaint against three named respondents and an unknown respondent in the name of another person.  According to the complaint, the Commission reviewed the complaint and found that it had reasonable cause to believe that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and that the complaint was filed in violation of Section 30109(a)(4)(A) of FECA.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin the Commission from future violations of the federal securities laws, and order the Commission to pay a civil penalty of $350,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On September 21, the SEC filed a civil action against the Commission for failing to act on the complaint. The complaint charges the Commission with violating Sections 10(e) and 13(b)(5)(A), and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The Commission has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to a judgment that enjoins it from violating the charged provisions and orders it to conduct an independent investigation. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Aug. 24, 2016).  The Commission's investigation was conducted in the Office of General Counsel and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
