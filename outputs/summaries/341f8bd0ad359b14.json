  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee yesterday entered a final judgment against a Tennessee-based company and its owner for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 66-21-101 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Davidson County, Tennessee, alleges that Tennessee law provides for the enforcement of a statutory lien by means of original attachment of lien-subject property.  According to the complaint, in late 2011, a repairman's lien arising under Tennessee Code Annotated section 66-19-101 (2015) was enforced by a method other than attachment of the lien subject property itself.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2013, AeroCentury Corp. purchased a model SAAB 340B aircraft from a California-based manufacturer, Colgan Air, Inc., which was scheduled to return the aircraft upon expiration of the lease.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, this lien is not enforceable by statute and there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the United States Court of Tennessee for the purpose of enforcing a lien on the proceeds of a public sale of an aircraft.  Specifically, the Complaint alleges that, as a result of the alleged violations of the federal securities laws, the company was unable to reach the proceeds from the sale of the aircraft. The complaint also alleges that the company failed to inform the court that it had obtained an emergency court order requiring it to attach the aircraft to the property before it could be sold to a purchaser.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission Bulletin, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of Tennessee law, ordering them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and ordering the company to pay civil penalties in the amount of $351,465.20. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see SEC Complaint Bulletin No. 5, No. 622, and No. 17-cv-01-17 (2014).  The Commission Bulletin also issued an order certifying violations of Sections 66-20-101 and 66-22-101, and requiring the company and the owner to submit to the SEC a copy of the Commission's Order.  On March 25, 2014, the SEC issued a subpoena to acquire the Aircraft, which was later unsealed on March 26, 2014. The subpoena was obtained by the SEC pursuant to Rule 23 of the SEC. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Tennessee Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Tennessee Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
