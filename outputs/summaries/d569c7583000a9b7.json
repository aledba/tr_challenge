  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Sky View at Las Palmas, LLC and Abraham Gottlieb for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Hidalgo County, Texas, alleges that Sky View, Israely, and Gottliebb violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, in 2008, Sky View sought a second construction loan from Texas State Bank for $6.5 million, secured by a second lien deed of trust, for Martinez's benefit.  At the time, the complaint alleges that the loan was overworked and the amount of money owed to Martinez was excessive.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action, charging Sky View with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rule 206(3) and 207(4)-8 thereunder, as well as aiding and abetting Sky View's violations of Section 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(a)(3) of Securities Exchange Rules 12b-20, 13b2-1, and 13a-13 thereunder and Section 15(d) of Rule 15d-1 thereunder of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering Sky View to pay $2,665,832.72 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of up to $100,000.  Sky View also agreed to pay a $1.275 million civil penalty and to pay an attorney's fee of $140,000, which is equal to the amount Martinez has already paid in the civil penalty.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2013, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Sky View from violating these provisions and orders it to pay civil penalties in the amount to be determined by the court at a later date.   The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the securities laws, and ordered the defendants to pay attorney's fees in the amounts of $1,275 million and $282,625.00, respectively. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by"
