  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maine today entered final judgments against Reginald J. Dobbins Jr. and his friend, Samuel Geary, in a criminal case brought by the Department of Justice.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Maine, on March 1, 2015, Geary was charged with murder, found guilty by a jury, and sentenced by the court (Aroostook County, Stewart, J.) to sixty-five years in prison without the possibility of a fair trial.  The complaint alleges that the court improperly excluded evidence of Geary's guilty plea, including evidence that he had been at the victim's home the night of the murder, and that Geary had entered a guilty plea to the murder without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In addition, the court found that the defendants' admissions of guilt were inconsistent with the evidence presented to the jury and that they should not be permitted to impose the mandatory imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment without the option of pre-judgment approval.  Additionally, the Court found that, based on the nature of the alleged misconduct, the defendants could not afford to risk prejudgment interest in the outcome of the trial. The court also ruled that, as a result of the court's finding, the defendant could not be found guilty of the charges and that the jury could not determine whether he had acted in concert with the other defendant in the murder.  Without admitting to these facts, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, with the right to reapply after five years of imprisonment. The final judgments also impose a $25,000 civil penalty against Geary. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Maine Office of Criminal Investigations in this matter."
