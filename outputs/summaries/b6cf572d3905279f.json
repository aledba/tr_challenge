  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against Ashley Compise, a convicted felon who was sentenced to five years of probation and ordered to pay restitution of $22,998.76 to a victim.  According to the SEC's complaint, Compise was in possession of jewelry that had been reported stolen by a victim in thefts from her home. The complaint alleges that Compise had been hired by the victim to clean the victim's home when she noticed her jewelry missing. Compise allegedly sold the stolen jewelry to Dan\u2019s Cash America on several occasions and failed to make restitution to the victim. The SEC alleges that after Compise pleaded guilty to the charges, she was placed on pretrial diversion based on a finding by the court that she was a significant risk to the community based on her lack of accountability.  The complaint further alleges that the court never considered whether Compise could be managed in the community as a result of her non-compliance with the conditions of supervision.  Compise also allegedly failed to provide DNA to Probation and Parole when negotiating for her diversion.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Compise arising from the same conduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the court has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins Compise from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Compise to pay a restitution amount equal to the amount of restitution she will pay. The court has also agreed to a temporary restraining order against the defendant and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after five years in prison. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 17, 2018, a federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, entered an order suspending Compise for five years and ordering her to report to probation and parole for supervision of her diversion beginning May 1, 2017. On June 16, 2017, the same court granted Compise a hearing on a motion to revoke her probation. On August 9, 2017 the court granted the court's order to restrand Compise and ordered her to comply with the court order. On February 16, 2018 the court issued an order to revoke Compise's probation and placed her on home incarceration with a sanction. On March 27, 2018 Compise agreed to be placed on home confinement with a suspended sentence of five years. On May 16,"
