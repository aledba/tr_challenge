  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found liable for multiple counts of felony possession of a firearm.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 22, 2016, the defendant, Marquise Newsom, confronted him outside a nightclub in Springfield, Massachusetts, and confronted him with a gun. The complaint alleges that the defendant knew that the gun was loaded and that he had used it to commit a home invasion, but that he did not have the requisite knowledge to use it. The SEC alleges that, contrary to the defendants' claims, the jury was not instructed to find the gun loaded and therefore could not find the requisite amount of knowledge to convict the defendant. In addition, the complaint alleges, as alleged in the complaint, that Newsom was not cooperative in the investigation, and that the jury could not have concluded that he was liable for a miscarriage of justice had they been properly instructed.  The SEC also alleges that Mitchell failed to disclose to the jury that he held that he and Newsom were in rival gangs and that, although he had knowledge of the gun, he had not used it as a weapon.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Mitchell, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Mitchell consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 206 (1), No. 207 (2), No. 207 (3), No No. 208 (4) (4), and No. 7 (4).  The complaint also seeks permanent injunctions against future violations of Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder and a bar against Mitchell from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security or other security-related product, including the right to a jury trial.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California and the Division of Criminal Justice."
