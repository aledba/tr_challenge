  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that, on March 17, 2013, Christopher Castagna and his brother, Keith Kaplan, entered an apartment in South Boston without a warrant. According to the complaint, the officers entered the apartment without warrants because they were responding to a call about a disturbance at the intersection of East 6th Street and O Street. The complaint alleges that the officers' entry into the apartment did not violate the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that they were not entitled to qualified immunity for the purpose of obtaining a warrant for the entry of a person's home. The court also found that the defendants' entry was unreasonable because the officers were not engaged in criminal investigation activity, and the officers did not engage in a \"community caretaking\" function. In addition, the court found that Defendants' entry to the apartment violated Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder. The Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC is continuing its investigation into the matter. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Doreste-Rodriguez, and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Boston Police Department, the Massachusetts State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Connecticut Department of Banking and Securities, the Department of Justice's Criminal Investigations, the Internal Revenue Service's Retail Strategy Task Force, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission's\u00c2\u00a0Investigations Task Force\u00c2\u00a0Commissioned in this matter, the Division of Enforcement's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related case, the SEC also issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint to the SEC seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws."
