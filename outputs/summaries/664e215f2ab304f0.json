  "summary": "On November 29, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against two pharmaceutical companies for defrauding Medicaid in violation of the federal False Claims Act.  According to the SEC's complaint, from April 1, 2005 through March 31, 2010, defendants Astellas Pharma US, Inc. (Astellas) and Lilly and Company (Lilly) entered into agreements with drug wholesalers under which they agreed to lower their AMPs by deducting \"price appreciation credits\" from the service fees they paid to the wholesaler, thereby increasing their profits without raising their AMP.  The complaint alleges that, at the time of the filing of the complaint, Astelas and Lilly had been voluntarily dismissed from Streck I and Streck III, respectively, for reasons other than the fact that they had been previously dismissed.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that in 2010, the SEC issued an order requiring the defendants to return their profits to the manufacturer, which in turn resulted in a reduction in the AMP that the defendants paid to each wholesaler.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Additionally, the court granted the Relator's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants, and ordered the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the defendants' alleged violations of the anti-fraud provisions under Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  A hearing on the matter is scheduled for May 24, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-7547 (E.D. Pa. 2012).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and\u00c2\u00a0check whether they have any background in the field of pharmacy fraud.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Eric Werner and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office.   The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner."
