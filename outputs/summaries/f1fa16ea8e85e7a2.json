  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of class certification for refund of tax refunds.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that, in 1994, the California Department of Revenue (DART) issued an order requiring certain entities to pay a certain amount of refund in a class action against the city of Bakersfield, California.  According to the complaint, the DART order required entities to file claims for refund with the district court for the purposes of determining whether a class certification was appropriate.  For example, the complaint alleged that, as a result of DART's order, all of the entities in the class were entitled to a full refund.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, DART and DART agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  DART also agreed to the issuance of a temporary restraining order prohibiting it from issuing or enforcing any class certification order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 1, 2013, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Ventas Finance I, LLC, a California-based company that paid a tax refund under DART, alleging that it had failed to adequately assess the merits of its claims and that DART had violated the federal securities laws by failing to provide sufficient information to determine whether it was appropriate to proceed with class certification.  Additionally, on May 2, 2014, a federal district court in San Diego, California entered a judgment ordering DART to comply with the court's order that it would not impose class certification without first hearing from all of its class members, including those who had filed their claims.   The court also ruled that the amount of the refund owed to DART should be determined by the District Court at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Fischer. \u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Secretary of State's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy in this matter."
