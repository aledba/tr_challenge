  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against the city of Somerville and the planning board for approving the Union Square Revitalization Plan, a twenty-year urban renewal program to redevelop land in Union Square in Somerville (the site). In 2015, a Somerville landowner, plaintiff Aliki Pishev, and the plaintiff taxpayer group filed an amended complaint alleging that the city and planning board did not comply with various requirements of the federal urban renewal law, G. L. c. 121B, in approving the plan. According to the amended complaint, the defendants failed to timely commence their action within sixty days of the date of final plan approval in 2012, a procedural failing requiring dismissal of her count I claims. The amended complaint also alleges that the taxpayer group did not have standing to challenge the 2012 plan and, as such, was precluded from continuing its claims under count II of the complaint. The court's judgment, which was entered today, permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of $8 million, prejudgment interest of $1.2 million, and a civil penalty of $500,000. The settlements are subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office, and is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development, the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Office of Inspector General and the Massachusetts Office of Environmental Education and Advocacy."
