  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment in favor of Matthew and Mark Mateikat, the trustees of a haunted house attraction in Ohio.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants were required to show cause and effect of their actions in order to qualify for summary judgment.  For example, the complaint alleges that, at the time the defendants filed their motion to dismiss, they had not yet entered the haunted house when they were chased by a costumed character.  In addition, as alleged, the Defendants' motion to revoke the defendants' entry of summary judgment in their favor was subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Sections 5 and 5 of the Exchange Act, and to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any registered nonprofit organization.  Additionally, Defendants agreed to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of their profits, to be offset by prejudgment interest of $5,000 and a $100,000 civil penalty from the defendants.  Finally, Defendants have agreed to settle the charges against them by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the federal anti-fraud provisions, ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $150,000 each, and imposing a $75,000 bar on the defendants and prohibiting them from participating in any type of sporting activity.  On May 24, 2017, the court granted summary judgment for the Mateikats, without order of the court, for Dungeons of Delhi, a member of whom the defendants had previously agreed to a summary judgment, without requiring them to prove that they were members of an unincorporated nonprofit association with some type of evidence provided for in Civ.R. 56(C).  In a parallel action, the Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order against the defendants, ordering them to comply with the court's order, and appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the alleged violations.   The Commission of Inquiry has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment"
