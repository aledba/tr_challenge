  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland today entered a final judgment in contempt against Gary J. Klopp of Owings Mills, Maryland and ordered him to pay disgorgement of over half-a-million dollars of his contemptuous earnings.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, alleges that, beginning in 2011, Klopp began taking kickbacks from a title-service company that he controlled. According to the complaint, for every loan that Klopp or his agents steered to a particular title company, he received roughly $400 in return. The complaint further alleges that Klopp concealed this kickback arrangement from his customers and concealed it from the regulators. The court ultimately found that Klopp violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Klopp to disgorge $987,920 in ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $75,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Klopp. The SEC previously charged Klopp with violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws, and he has agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The Court also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Klopp from violating the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act. The judgment also orders Klopp to pay $2,000 in disgorgements and a $1,000 civil penalty. The final judgment also prohibits Klopp from acting solely as a personnel or human-resources manager for a mortgage business operated by an FDIC-insured banking institution. In addition, the court found that he violated the reporting requirements in the Consent Order, which required him to comply with certain reporting requirements, and that he had to submit a copy of the final consent order to the court. The order also prohibits him from contacting, soliciting, or otherwise dealing with any third party businesses engaged in offering any settlement service.  On the same day, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Klopp, charging him with violations of Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 5(b). The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of the Exchange Act, a civil monetary penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against Klopp from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The litigation will be led by Russell A. Kasper and supervised by"
