  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Pennsylvania yesterday entered a final judgment against the school district in a civil injunctive action brought by the District Attorney's Office.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on February 16, 2016, a school bus video was requested by a school district to record an altercation between a student and a parent. The complaint alleges that the video, which was recorded by the school bus camera system, showed a confrontation between a high school varsity basketball player and an adult, and the video showed the interaction between the student and the adult.  The complaint further alleges that although the video was not an investigative record, it was a record that was relevant to a noncriminal investigation.  As alleged in the complaint, the video did not relate to a criminal investigation, because it was not a record of a school disciplinary proceeding.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the district consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the district from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the district to provide a copy of the video to a television news station.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting the suspension and/or destruction of documents related to the suspension, destruction of records, and other emergency relief.  On December 5, 2018, the court granted the district's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the release of a video recording of the alleged incident. The court also issued an order requiring the district attorney's office to provide access to the video in a \"proof safe.\"  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Police Department, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service and the Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General in this matter."
