  "summary": "On May 3, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Colorado entered a final judgment against the defendants in a related case.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 39-1-102(14.4)(a) of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Denver, Colorado, the defendants misrepresented to assessors that their parcels of land constituted \"contiguous\" and \"used as a unit\" when, in reality, they were undeveloped.  As alleged in the complaint, these parcels were not contiguous and could not be classified as residential as the defendants claimed.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of the defendants' misrepresentations to the assessor and the court of appeals, they are not entitled to reclassify the parcels as residential.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the anti-fraud provisions, and order the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  On May 4, 2019, the court granted the Defendants' motion for certiorari and granted the defendants a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendants from violating these provisions, as well as other federal statutes, and orders them to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-14-4 (2019).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Denver Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mook and Ms. Kelly. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Colorado Department of Revenue, the Denver Office of Financial Regulation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the Denver Field Office of the Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to identify whether their investments qualify for a tax exemption."
