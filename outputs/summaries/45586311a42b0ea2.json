  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against two Michigan-based companies for violating the open and obvious danger doctrine.  The SEC's complaint alleges that BRK, Inc. and R & C Land, Inc., both doing business as Diamondback Saloon, violated the federal, state, and local laws that govern the use of accessible, barrier-free entranceways to public facilities.  According to the complaint, BRK and R&C Land failed to comply with the requirements of the federal and state laws and failed to adequately protect physically limited persons with disabilities.  Specifically, the SEC alleges that defendants failed to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition, failed to warn customers about the potential dangers, and did not replace the entranceway step with a ramp.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against BRK. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained a temporary restraining order, ordering BRK to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and ordering R &C Land to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions, imposes a bar on them, and requires them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes civil penalties of $20,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
