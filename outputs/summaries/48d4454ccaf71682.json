  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant John \"Jay\" Thomas, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Thomas to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on Thanksgiving night 2014, Thomas met Whitney \"Strawberry\" Blackwell at Club Venus in Detroit where she worked as a stripper and prostitute. According to the complaint, Thomas and his accomplices stole $50,000 in cash, 2,500 OxyContin pills, and an ounce of cocaine from Blackwell. The complaint further alleges that Thomas told Blackwell that he would \"squeeze my money out of him\" if she did not cooperate with the authorities.  As alleged, however, the court did not err on the side of caution and did not require Thomas to admit or deny the allegations in the complaint.  Instead, Thomas consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $45,000 and a civil penalty of $75,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Thomas has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Thomas.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans of the Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order against Thomas, ordering him to surrender his passport, and appointing a receiver to oversee the operation of the Atlanta Field Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for New York, and the Federal Office of the Inspector General."
