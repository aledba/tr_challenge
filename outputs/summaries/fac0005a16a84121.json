  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado today announced criminal charges against Carold Peoples for his role in an alleged overpayment of Social Security disability benefits.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, on May 30, 2010, the Department of Transportation (CDOT) filed a final admission of liability (FAL) for a worker who sustained a work-related injury in February 2010. The complaint alleges that after learning of the overpayment, CDOT began paying claimant TTD and PPD benefits in March 2010. In 2013, when the agency determined that claimant qualified as disabled, it awarded him a monthly sum of social security disability benefits (SSDI). The complaint further alleges that when CDOT filed its 2013 FAL, it failed to deduct the overpayments from the claimant\u2019s ongoing disability benefits, which were not reflected in the calculation of such disability benefits or death benefit. The SEC alleges that CDOT could have sought an order for repayment within one year of learning of an overpayment by filing an amended FAL that included a calculated overpayment that reflected the offsets. Instead, the complaint alleges, as alleged in the complaint, the agency failed to timely and timely advise CDOT of its obligations under Section 8-42-113.5(1)(b.5)(I) and Rule 8-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and ordering CDOT to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its overpayment. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Office of Insurance Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado Department of Health and Human Services."
