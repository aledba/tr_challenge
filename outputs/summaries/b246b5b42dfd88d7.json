  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Flint, Michigan, alleges that, beginning in the late 1990s, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) and the state Department of Environmental Quality (LAN) failed to adequately assess the health risks posed by the Flint River water supply.  According to the complaint, the MDHHS andLAN failed to inform Flint residents that the water supply was contaminated with lead and legionella.  In addition, the complaint alleges that during the course of the litigation, the defendants made numerous false statements to the public regarding the safety of Flint's drinking water.  For example, as alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Michigan DEQ failed to properly assess the risks of the Flint water supply and failed to provide timely and accurate information about the source of the contamination.  Further, the SEC alleges that the defendants failed to disclose to the residents that they were at risk of exposure to lead-tainted water from the Flint Water Treatment Plant, even though they knew the water was safe and could be used as a source of drinking water for Flint's residents.  Additionally, the Complaint alleges that in 2014, the MDEQ issued an emergency order requiring Flint to return to the DWSD water supply, which it did not do, and that in 2015, the city of Flint, then-Director of Public Works Howard Croft, issued an order requiring the city to comply with the federal requirements for water treatment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the federal criminal case, the Defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.   The defendants also agreed to be barred from serving as officers or directors of public agencies for five years, with the right to reapply after five years.  Finally, the settlements are subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and Carol A. McKinley of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the U."
