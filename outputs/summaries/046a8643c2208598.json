  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alaska today entered final judgments against the City of Fairbanks and Public Safety Employees Association (PSEA) in an administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fairbanks, Alaska, alleges that, in 2013, the city and PSEA began negotiating a collective bargaining agreement for fiscal years 2014 through 2017. The complaint alleges that the city council delayed ratifying the agreement until it was certain that it could meet its obligations under the federal contract and that it had the authority to order the city to execute the agreement. According to the complaint, the City Council then delayed the ratification until after the October municipal election to determine whether the agreement was a \"public employer\" and whether the city had the ability to appropriate money for the city's needs. The SEC also alleges that in August 2014, after hearing from the public and being persuaded by members of PSEA's negotiating team that the City could not afford to ratify the agreement, PSEA filed a complaint with the ALRA, alleging that city council members had unreasonably delayed and delayed the implementation of the agreement by more than two months. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the city.  In its complaint filed today, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the court also issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent review of the complaint.  On August 25, 2014, a federal judge in Anchorage issued a final judgment that permanently enjoins the city from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, and orders the City to comply with the proposed settlement provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of its books and records. The order also requires the city attorney and city clerk to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court.  A hearing officer will determine whether to issue an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, and the litigation will be led by John Rymas. The case is being supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Atlanta Regional Office."
