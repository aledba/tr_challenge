  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of Woodville Mutual Insurance Company (Woodville), Erie Insurance Exchange (Erie), and Jim Phillips Excavating, Inc. (collectively, \"the Phillips defendants\").  The court found that Woodville, Erie, and the Phillips defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The Court also found that the defendants failed to adequately disclose to the court that Jake Phillips was remodeling a barn for a friend, who resided in a condominium complex.  According to the Court's order, Jake Phillips, who worked for his father's company, had performed this type of work approximately ten times before the barn demolition project.  As alleged in the complaint, in April 2013, Jake and his father, Jim Phillips, were hired to demolish a barn on the property for $3,000.  Jake and Apling agreed to settle the case by agreeing to pay $313,553.55 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their respective losses.  In a parallel action, the Court of Common Pleas today entered a judgment against Woodville and Erie that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the business pursuit provision of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties of up to $1.5 million.  On May 12, 2019, the court granted the motion for summary judgment, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, to Woodville's and Erie's requests for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, and ordered the defendants to pay a $1,500 civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio State Department of Insurance, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Banking and Securities, the U. S. Postal Inspection Service, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Michigan, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
