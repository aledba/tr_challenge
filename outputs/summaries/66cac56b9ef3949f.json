  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Atlas Air, Inc. and its former CEO, Robert Kirchner, for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, since at least 2011, Atlas has engaged in a long-running campaign to obstruct or delay the implementation of a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA).  The complaint alleges that the CBA provides for the right of a party to engage in a concerted campaign to change the status quo in order to generate economic leverage in the ongoing contract negotiations.  According to the complaint, as a result of this campaign, Atlas's pilots have been calling in sick at a higher rate than they did prior to the Commission's announcement of the new CBA.  As a result, the complaint alleges, the majority of Atlas pilots have not been able to participate in any meaningful effort to resolve the ongoing CBA dispute.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has obtained an order appointing an independent arbitrator to determine whether Atlas is violating the duty-and-honor provisions of the federal contract.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Atlas agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and orders the company to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in the amount of $50,000.  Atlas also agreed to pay $75,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, and other emergency relief agencies."
