  "summary": "On January 17, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against New York Farm Bureau, Inc., a New York-based farm labor organization, and two other defendants in a related action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, the farm laborer exclusion is a violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, in 1938, the New York State Department of Labor and Agribusiness passed a provision that prohibited farm laborers from participating in collective bargaining.  In addition, in 1940, the Department of Economic and Risk Analysis (EASTA) issued an order requiring farm laborers to register as a \"person\" with the agency.  As alleged in the complaint, the Farm Bureau's exclusion is based on the nature of the farm laborers' work and the fact that many farm laborers \"often have very low levels of educational attainment,\u201d that they are \"predominantly racial and ethnic minorities,\" and that many \"lack lawful immigration status.\"  The Farm Bureau also alleges that the exclusion is not narrowly tailored to protect the right to organize and collectively bargain under the federal law.  Without admitting or denying these allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requiring them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 or less.  On January 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge William J. Donnelly of the U District Court in Brooklyn granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. McCluskey and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
