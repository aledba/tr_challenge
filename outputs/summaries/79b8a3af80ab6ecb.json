  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of Apache Corp.'s (AAPL) motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the company's assets, and ordering the company to pay $767,242 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that Apache violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Davis was terminated on December 3, 2012, shortly after she filed a complaint of age or gender discrimination with the Commission.  Davis allegedly told Ricotta that she was being terminated because she was \"tired\" of working overtime and did not understand why she had been passed over in receiving a promotion because of her age.  Ricotta allegedly told Davis that she would be happy to stop working overtime if she had a reasonable basis to do so.  In a parallel action, the Commission issued a right-to-sue letter to Ricotta, informing her that the Commission had sufficient evidence to determine whether she had engaged in a protected activity and that she should not have been terminated based on that finding.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Ricotta consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million, and orders Davis to disgorge her ill-gotten gains plus interest of $2.2 million and a $100,000 civil penalty.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Fort Worth office by Kelly L. Gibson, John R. Rymas, and Glenn S. Gordon, with the assistance of the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations' Office of Inspector General. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Gordon. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Commission, the Texas Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office."
