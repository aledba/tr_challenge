  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on June 7, 2018, entered a final judgment that permanently terminated the parental rights of a Michigan man who was previously incarcerated for drug-related charges.  The court's order, which was entered on July 23, 2018 in the case of Adoption of S.P., requires that the court determine whether a defendant has a right to counsel in contested involuntary termination of parental rights cases.  According to the order, filed on January 15, 2016, the defendant had been convicted following a jury trial on November 17, 2015, of inter alia DUI-refusal, and driving while operating as an unregistered driver.  He had been sentenced on March 4, 2016 to 12 months in prison for drug possession.  In a parallel action, the court also issued an order suspending Father's parental rights for a period of at least six months.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Father consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 2511 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 17(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder of Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  Father also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the termination of his parental rights, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The Court granted the request for a temporary restraining order against Father and ordered him to sign a copy of the court order that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000. \u00c2\u00a0The court also granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rules 5b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder; and ordered that he pay a $75,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 penalty.  On July 24, 2018 the court granted the SEC's request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered a hearing on July 26, 2018 to determine whether to proceed with a related administrative proceeding against Father.  A hearing scheduled for May 31, 2018 was rescheduled for April 12, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5,"
