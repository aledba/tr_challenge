  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who has agreed to settle charges that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, on October 16, 2003, a trial court improperly instructed a jury to determine whether to charge Walker with malice murder based on the fact that, at the time of her death, Walker had not lost any of his five children before she died.  Walker also alleges that the jury learned that Walker had made certain incriminating statements in a jailhouse letter to a fellow inmate while awaiting trial.  According to the complaint, Walker told the jury that he had never lost [any] of my five [children] before [Daijah], and that he never hurt any of them before her.  He also claimed that, during closing argument and the jury charge, Walker \"was more violent to Daijah than he was toward her.\"  The complaint further alleges that Walker failed to object to the jury\u2019s decision to charge him on the basis that, in the days and hours leading up to the death, he had sustained numerous injuries, including internal bruising produced by exterior blows.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he failed to adequately represent that Walker was guilty of the same felony that he was charged with, and that, as a matter of constitutional due process, he suffered prejudice as a result of his deficient performance.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Walker has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 24-9-80 (2014).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Walker arising from the same conduct alleged in the Complaint.  A hearing for the SEC today was scheduled for 11:30 a.m. Eastern.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment in a business."
