  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of possession of a controlled substance in a hotel room bathroom.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Jeremy Paul Flinchum, a former officer of the Archdale Police Department, provided false testimony to a trial court regarding the identity of the substance in possession of heroin in the hotel room.  According to the complaint, the defendant told an investigating officer that she had ingested heroin and that he had located a baggy of meth hidden in her bra.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant told the officer that the substance was a \"redish-tan or white rock\" and that several investigating officers identified the substance as heroin.  As alleged, however, the evidence presented by the investigating officers did not support the defendant\u2019s conviction.  Instead, the SEC alleges that the defendant failed to provide sufficient evidence to support her conviction, and the trial court ultimately denied her motion for a temporary restraining order, which would have required her to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000.  Additionally, the court granted the SEC's request for an emergency asset freeze and an officer-and-director bar, and ordered the SEC to conduct a field test that would determine whether the substance contained in the defendant's hotel room was heroin, and whether a chemical analysis performed by a person with expertise in interpreting the results produced by such an analysis was sufficient to determine whether a drug possession conviction should be dismissed.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the United States District Court in Charlotte entered a judgment ordering a temporary asset freeze against the defendant and ordering him to pay $1.5 million in restitution.  Burt also agreed to the judgment, which requires the court to consider the merits of the case against him, and that the court will determine the amount of monetary relief to be provided by the relief ordered by the court.  Finally, the Court of Appeals issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, ordering the receiver to identify the substance that the receiver had ingested.   The receiver has agreed to a $1 million civil penalty and to the payment of a $2 million penalty. "
