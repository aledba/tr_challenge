  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two New York City-based outdoor advertising companies for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, on May 28, 2015 and unsealed on October 29, 2015, the Court found that Ciafone, owner of five buildings in Long Island City, New York, and corporate building owner Franklin Street Realty Corp. and J.P. & Associates Properties Corp. violated Section 15(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1.

A hearing officer also agreed to be suspended from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney and to the appointment of a receiver for the purpose of recovering any ill-gotten gains from his or her misappropriation of funds from the sale of the building.  Finally, a hearing officer agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 15 of the Exchange Act, ordering him to comply with the court order requiring him to provide a copy of the Commission's Rules of Practice, which he has already issued, including an order that requires him to submit to a court order that prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, or promotion of any type of outdoor advertising, including any materials that may be commercially or otherwise valuable to a business, profession, service or entertainment conducted, sold, or offered on the same or a different zoning lot.
