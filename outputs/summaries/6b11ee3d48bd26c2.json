  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona today entered a final judgment against a parent who failed to show up at a scheduled severance hearing.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Phoenix, alleges that, on September 9, 2015, Trisha A. (\u201cMother\u201d) was admitted to Banner Behavioral Health for substance abuse treatment for which she did not have good cause for failing to appear at a pretrial hearing and, on an accelerated basis, severing her rights in absentia.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, the court improperly set aside the severance order based on insufficient evidence to determine whether a parent had waived her right to the care and custody of her children.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court did not consider the merits of the case presented to the court, and that, at the time of the hearing, Mother had not provided the children with reasonable support because she had not sent the children any gifts, birthday cards, or letters.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Mother consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a $10,000 civil penalty.  On March 22, 2017, the Arizona District Court entered an order granting a temporary restraining order against Mother and ordering her to attend a hearing scheduled for February 23, 2017. The court granted the court's order granting the temporary injunction against Mother, and ordered her to show cause for her absence at the hearing. The order also granted the juvenile court the right to expedite a hearing for a final determination as to whether to hold a hearing pursuant to Rule 64(C).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Arizona today announced criminal charges against Mother. The SEC is continuing its investigation, which is being conducted by John Rymas of the Arizona Office of Criminal Investigations. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Juvenile Justice. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and supervised by Ms. Gibson. The Commission on Children and Family Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage parents to check the background of anyone offering or offering them advice on how to protect their children.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of Arizona Attorney General Jeff Merkley and the Arizona Department of Child Safety in this matter."
