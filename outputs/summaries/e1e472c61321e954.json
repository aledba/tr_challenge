  "summary": "On March 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia entered a final judgment in favor of the State of Georgia, finding that it was unreasonable to delay obtaining a search warrant for the electronic devices of two former foster children who died while in the care of Jennifer and Joseph Rosenbaum.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, on June 23, 2017, the Henry County Police Department and its lead detective, Aris Thompson, conducted an impound inventory of an appellees' vehicle and found that the devices had been seized without a warrant.  According to the complaint, the delay was approximately a year and a half, and the complaint alleges that the officers did not diligently pursue their investigation as it relates to the content of the devices until after the hearing on November 6, 2017.  In its judgment, the court held that the unreasonable delay in obtaining a warrant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The court also granted the defendants a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from destroying any evidence or evidence in the possession of a person or property, and from participating in any conduct that constitutes a reasonable search.  On March 9, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Thompson, charging him with violating Section 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(2) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and seeking a permanent injunction against future violations.  To learn more about unreasonable search warrants, see Litigation Release No. 5-7-1 (a) (B) (2014).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Atlanta today announced criminal charges against Thompson.  This case was investigated by the Atlanta Regional Office, which also conducted an examination of the Apple and iPad devices seized from the Appellees\u2019 vehicle.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Professional and Risk Analysis, with the assistance of the Atlanta Office of the Chief of Police, and was supervised by Assistant Director of Public Health and a Senior Trial Counsel. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigational Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment."
