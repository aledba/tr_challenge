  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Thomas Nelson's motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing his assets, and ordering him to pay $3 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Thomas Nelson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Thomas Nelson misrepresented to EPAC that it was ready, willing, and able to perform under the terms of the Exchange Act, and that it did not have a duty to disclose.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, at the time of the alleged breach, EPAC's books and warehouse data were not being used as promised, and, in fact, it had not produced any books at all.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains, and requires them to pay civil penalties of at least $2 million.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 598 (Feb. 14, 2019).  The Court also issued an order suspending Thomas Nelson from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On March 17, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Thomas Nelson, charging him with violating Rule 50(b).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against him.
