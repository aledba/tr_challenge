  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jovani Textiles, Inc., a New York-based fabric manufacturer, and two insurance companies for their alleged failure to defend and indemnify it in an insurance policy breach.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Malibu Textiles violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Malibu violated the duty to defend, which is required under the federal securities laws, by producing and selling a product with a \"copyrighted\" design.  Malibu also allegedly failed to disclose that it had used samples of the same design in its advertisements.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Insurance Regulation (OIE) today announced that it has issued an order suspending the registration of certain insurance policies.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their respective profits.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 16-CV-8409 (January 24, 2017).  The Complaint charges Malibu with violations of the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rules 206(3) and 206 (4) and with aiding and abetting Malibu's violations of Section 17(a) of The Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and penny stock and officer-and-director bars against Malibu.  Separately, the SEC filed an action in the United States District Court in Manhattan against Sunham Home Fashions, Inc. and Commercial Union Ins. Co., both of which were defendants in the alleged breach-of-trust action.  On September 6, 2018, the Court granted the Complaint's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered Malibu to comply with the Exchange Act, and ordered it to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. McGlynn."
