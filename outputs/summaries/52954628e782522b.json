  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against defendant Debra Vandercook, a Michigan resident, for her role in an October 2013 automobile accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Michigan, alleges that, on February 18, 2015, defendant Deborah Andreson, a resident of Michigan, filed a claims log with the court that reflected her initial assessment of whether Debra had suffered a serious impairment of body function. According to the complaint, Debra and her neurosurgeon, Dr. Christopher Abood, agreed to settle the case by agreeing to pay $1.324 million in attorney fees and $15,465.67 in taxable costs to each defendant. The complaint also alleges that defendant agreed to a $50,000 offset with respect to Debra, which reflected the amount of her injured lower-back injuries. The settlement, which is subject to court approval, required Debra to pay a total of $1,324,112.68, including $200,000 for Debra's injured lower back. The court also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Debra.  On May 19, 2016, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an order halting the issuance of the court's order, ordering a preliminary injunction, and imposing a civil penalty of $100,000. The SEC previously issued an order freezing the assets of defendants and ordering them to pay civil penalties of $150,000 each.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendant consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge $1 million in illusory gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering him not to pay any civil penalties in the future. The order also prohibits defendant from participating in case evaluation, which resulted in a nonunanimous award. The judge granted the motion for an injunction and ordered that the court consider the merits of the case. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, David A. Kasper, and Amy C. Welshhans. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Michigan State Attorney General's Office."
