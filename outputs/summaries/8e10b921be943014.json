  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Norfolk Southern Railway Company (\"Norfolk Southern\") in a demurrage case.  The SEC's complaint, filed on November 22, 2017, alleges that Norfolk Southern violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, on January 16, 2018, a federal district court in New York granted the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered Norfolk Southern to pay a $951,025.00 civil penalty and to return possession of the rail cars to Judge.  According to the complaint, Norfolk Southern also failed to timely respond to Judge's request for a referral to the STB, despite repeated requests to do so.  Norfolk Southern's complaint also alleges that the court improperly delayed the filing of a motion to refer the matter to the agency for determination of whether it was unreasonable to refer a case to the court and whether it had sufficient expertise and expertise to determine when and in what circumstances to grant the relief.   The court's order also prohibits Norfolk Southern from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in a case where it is not a party to the rules and regulations of the federal securities laws.  It also prohibits the company from associating with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders it to pay civil penalties equal to the amount of the civil penalties it has already paid to the broker, and orders Norfolk to comply with the agreed-upon settlement provisions of the proposed settlement.  On January 24, 2019, the court granted the court's motion to hold a hearing on the merits of the case and granted Norfolk Southern the right to a preliminary injunction against future violations of the charged provisions, and to appoint a receiver to determine whether to issue an order appointing a receiver pursuant to the relevant rules and practices of the relevant federal agencies.  Additionally, the Court granted the request for an injunction against Norfolk Southern and ordered the receiver to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver.
