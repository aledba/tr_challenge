  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Grain Belt Express Clean Line LLC (GBX), an Indiana company formed to construct and manage a high voltage electric transmission line.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 10, 2015, the Illinois Secretary of State's Office issued an expedited order granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity to GBX for the construction of a new high voltage transmission line and related facilities.  The SEC alleges that GBX violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the expedited application process under Section 8\u2013406 of the Public Utilities Act of 1940 (\"PCA\").  The complaint further alleges that the Commission improperly granted GBX's request to expedite the approval of the Commission's order, which was subject to court approval.  In its order, the SEC also issued an order suspending GBX from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any new high-voltage transmission line or related project.  Without admitting or denying the SEC&rsquo;s allegations, GBX consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating Section 10\u00c2\u00a0b of the Exchange Act and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  GBX also agreed to pay disgorgement of $2,500 plus prejudgment interest of $0.05 per share and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public utility for five years.   The settlement is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott M. Mascianica of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Ms. McCabe and Mr. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Missouri, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Illinois Attorney General's Office."
