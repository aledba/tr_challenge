  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Florida today entered a final judgment ordering SunTrust Bank to show cause as to why it should not be held in contempt of a court order requiring it to release its second mortgage.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on December 7, 2012, Florida resident Jesus Enrique \"Debtor\" Batista-Sanchez developed high-end, luxury homes in central Florida through a company known as Kasa Development.  The complaint alleges that the Chapter 11 Plan and Confirmation Order provided for the right to release the second mortgage on the property without violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, SunTrust has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $250,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against Debtor.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Basinger. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Florida Department of Insurance, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Miami Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice's Retail Strategy Task Force, the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit, the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Fraud Task Force and the Florida Division of Banking Regulation. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also check the background of anyone selling investments using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's Investor.gov website to quickly identify if they are professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the U.K.'s Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against SunTrust, alleging that it violated the federal anti-fraud laws, and that SunTrust violated the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (d)"
