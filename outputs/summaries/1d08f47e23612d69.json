  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against Baltimore County Sheriff John S. Wolfe for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that, in violation of the federal securities laws, Commissioner Wolfe failed to comply with the mandatory requirements of the Exchange Act, including the 30-day time requirement for a hearing board to determine whether to increase a penalty.  According to the complaint, Wolfe also failed to record the hearing board's recommendation for a penalty increase.  As alleged, the SEC's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins Commissioner Wolfe from increasing the penalty, and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and a $25,000 officer and director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Wolfe.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the CFTC have agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the securities laws. The CFTC has also agreed to a temporary restraining order, which prohibits it from issuing or selling any security or other security-related materials, including documents, to the public. The Commission has agreed to an order appointing a receiver to conduct a hearing on the record. The receiver will determine the amount of the penalty that will be imposed upon the receiver. The hearing will be conducted within 30 days after receipt of the Commission's recommendation, and the receiver to determine the timing of the hearing. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.C. Secret Service, the Maryland Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Baltimore Police Department, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Maryland Department of Banking and Securities and Insurance."
