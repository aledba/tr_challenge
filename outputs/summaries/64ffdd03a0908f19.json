  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Ohio today announced criminal charges against an Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper for his role in a drug-trafficking scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Wood County, Ohio, alleges that, on October 22, 2015, Trooper Anthony Martin stopped a red Jeep Cherokee in the median of the southbound lane near Wales Road in Michigan.  According to the complaint, Martin observed the Jeep change lanes and then slowed substantially under the speed limit.  As alleged, the driver of the Jeep allegedly had a \"spur of the moment\" experience and was able to exercise dominion and control over an item.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the driver was \"unconscious due to sleep\" and \"visibly shaking\" when he was seen holding a plastic baggie in his right fist.  Martin also allegedly observed a male passenger in the back seat who appeared to be sleeping.   The complaint further alleges that one of the occupants of the vehicle, Layke Holmes, was asleep at the time of the stop and did not wake up when the trooper asked him to wake him up.  On the morning of the second day of the trial, the court found that Martin violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Martin consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities for a period of five years.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay disgorgement of $2,655,078 plus prejudgment interest of $192,768, and a civil penalty of $100,000, and requires him to be permanently enjoined from the securities industry, including securities law violations, from participating or participating in any offering of securities, including the issuance of an officer-and-director bar, from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Welshhans, John Rymas, and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office, with the assistance of the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, and the Ohio Department of Justice's Office of Criminal Investigations.
