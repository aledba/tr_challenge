  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Rancho Viejo Waste Management, LLC, a Laredo, Texas-based waste treatment company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, Texas on August 2, 2018, the City Council passed a resolution in opposition to a proposed regional landfill.  The complaint alleges that the city's decision to withdraw from negotiations was inconsistent with the Commission's finding that the landfill was not in the best interests of the community and that it did not meet the requirements of the federal law.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the company.  On August 3, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the city, charging it with violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Act Section 10b of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting the company's violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the city consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the federal securities laws, ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and ordering the company to disgorge its ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and pay civil penalties of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas of the Fort Worth Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Enforcement's Public Finance Abuse Unit. The SEC's litigation will be led by Kristina A. Cortez and Ms. Jordan. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Environmental Quality."
