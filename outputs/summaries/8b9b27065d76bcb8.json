  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a former employee of the Rockingham County Department of Social Services for her alleged misconduct.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that former employee Gloria R. Watlington violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Watlington accepted a $60 loan from a foster parent in December 2015, which she repaid within one week after she was notified of the misconduct. The complaint further alleges that Ms. Watlington used approximately six dollars ($6.00) of a child\u2019s money to purchase food for herself and paid the money back a week later.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Ms. Watletay has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay back the amount of her ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Watlington.  On May 24, 2017, the Honorable J. Randall May granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and a conduct-based injunction against further violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1. The court also issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an order imposing a civil injunctive relief order.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2018, is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-0117 (January 24, 2018).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, under the supervision of John Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
