  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California yesterday entered a final judgment against Restoration Hardware, Inc. (RHI) in a class action action brought by former class members.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia on September 5, 2014, the court issued a temporary restraining order preventing the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also ordered the defendants to pay $36,412,350 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $1.8 million.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against one of the defendants in connection with the same action.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendants committed numerous violations of the Song-Beverly Credit Card Act when it asked for and recorded ZIP codes from customers who used credit cards in making RHI purchases.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, RHI agreed to settle the case without admitting, denying, or denying its motion for a preliminary injunction, and appointing a receiver to facilitate payment of the judgment.  RHI also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $30,000.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for 11:30 a.m. EST on September 29, 2014.  On September 30, 2015, the Court of Appeal granted the class members\u2019 request for an emergency court order to halt the litigation pending before it.  After a hearing on Sept. 29, 2019, a jury found RHI liable for 1,213,745 violations of Section 902 of the Exchange Act and ordered RHI to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 penalty.  To resolve the case, the defendant agreed to a settlement that satisfied the parties\u2019 requests for an injunction and a civil injunction.  At the hearing, the jury deliberated for two hours before issuing its final judgment, finding that RHI was liable for more than 1,000,000 violations of Exchange Act Rule 902 and ordering the receiver to pay the judgment in a timely manner.  Finally, on September 31, the trial court issued an order suspending RHI from appearing or practicing before the court as a class member and ordering it to comply with the court order suspending the class action order and ordering RHI not to participate in the settlement proceedings.
