  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment in favor of the City of Baltimore in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio.  The court's order, which was entered on March 29, 2013, finds that the City violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that the city violated the First Amendment by failing to disclose that the Center for Pregnancy Concerns, Inc., a non-profit pregnancy center located in Baltimore, does not offer or refer for abortions, and does not require a waiting room disclosure. Instead, the court ordered the Center to post a disclaimer in its waiting room notifying clients that it \"does not provide or make referral for abortion or birth control services.\" The court further ordered the center to provide an accounting of the number of women who entered the center's waiting room during the offering of an abortion. The Court's order also imposed a $150,000 civil penalty against the center.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Baltimore on March 30, 2010, the Commission's order requires the Commission to determine whether the Center is economically motivated, whether it has a legitimate business purpose, and whether it is subject to reasonable regulatory scrutiny. The Commission's complaint charges the Center with violating the First and Administrative Rules of the federal government. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the Center. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Advocacy and Public Finance. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The Office of Compliance and Regulatory Affairs has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint\u00c2\u00a0on behalf of the Commission on\u00c2\u00a0Advisers to Public Finance Abuse,\u00c2\u00a0On\u00c2\u00a0September\u00c2\u00a01\u00c2\u00a02014.
