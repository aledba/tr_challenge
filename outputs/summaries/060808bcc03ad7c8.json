  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Billy Carol Anderson, Jr., a convicted felon, on seven counts of sexual battery and one count of touching of a child forlustful-purposes.  The court found that Anderson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, Anderson violated Section 97-5-23 of the Exchange Act, which requires defendants to show cause and effect of a court order imposing a penalty equal to or greater than the penalty imposed by the court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Anderson.  Anderson has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $500,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Anderson has agreed to a permanent injunction, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged conduct. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Mr. Barry and Ms. Basinger."
