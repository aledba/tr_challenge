  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against R.R.S., a Texas-based adult who pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated sexual assault.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in El Paso, Texas, alleges that, from the age of thirteen, R.S.'s father repeatedly sexually assaulted his five-year-old twin brothers.  According to the complaint, the father consented to the entry of a written stipulation admitting to the allegations, waiving his right to trial, and acknowledging his understanding that, in light of the nature of the conduct alleged, he could be placed on probation or committed to the custody of the Juvenile Justice Department.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an emergency court order halting the proceedings of the trial court.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the court of appeals ruled that R.RS. could not have committed the offense of sexual assault because he was not adequately informed of the potential defenses when he entered his plea, particularly the defense that he had not engaged in the conduct, and that, as a matter of law, a child under fourteen cannot legally consent to sex. The court also ruled that, based on the evidence presented to the court at the time of the adjudication hearing, there was insufficient evidence to support the court\u2019s finding.  For further information, see Texas Criminal Code \u00a7 22.021(a)(2)(B).  The Court of Appeals also found that, contrary to the stated intent of the court, the defendant had not acted \"knowingly or ardently\" to commit the offenses, and therefore could not consent to the conduct.  On May 5, 2019, the Honorable Judge Steven A. Mascianica entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  A hearing on June 21, 2020, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric R. Braunstein and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Department of Criminal Investigation."
