  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming today entered a final judgment against Strata Energy, Inc., a Wyoming-based company that sought a license to mine uranium in the Ross In Situ Recovery Uranium Project.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Wyoming, alleges that Strata violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it failed to adequately consider the potential environmental impacts of mining the Ross project.  According to the complaint, Strata's application was filed only after the Commission had issued a license for the Ross Project, and the staff relied solely upon the information provided in the FEIS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's opinion, the Councils consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Strata from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his or her profits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company.  Among other things, the SEC's investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious patterns in the background of an action. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Wyoming Department of Natural Resources. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to quickly spot any signs of fraud or a potential violation of the securities laws."
