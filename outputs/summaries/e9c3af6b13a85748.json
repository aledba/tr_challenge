  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by a former corrections officer who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity because they had been convicted on two counts of assault as a result of the same conduct.  According to the complaint, defendants were then confronted by a group of prison officials who beat, threatened, and harassed Mr. Sayed in a vestibule area, and then put him in segregation in retaliation for filing a grievance against Lt. Virginia. The complaint further alleges that the prison officials violated their clearly established right of access to the courts.  As alleged, defendants forfeited qualified immunity by failing to engage in any relevant analysis, failing to address the dual qualified immunity inquiry, and, further, that the claims were not barred by Heck.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 24, 2018, the U.N. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed an emergency action in which it temporarily suspended trading in the CFTC's securities for a penny stock and issued an order suspending trading in CFTC securities. The SEC is continuing its investigation into whether CFTC violated its securities trading rules.  To learn more about how CFTC trades in securities, see Investor.gov/Securities."
