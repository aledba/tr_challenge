  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Missouri announced today that it has obtained an emergency court order halting a planned asset freeze and asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbia, Missouri, alleges that Evelyn E. Bell and her husband, Joe A. Bell, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Mrs. Bell transferred assets at her husband's death in a manner that was deemed by the agency to be a disqualifying disposal of assets.  In a parallel action, the Department of Health and Human Services today announced that it filed an emergency action against Bell and Bell-Bell-Bell, charging them with violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hallam has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $607,000.  Hallam also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for the purpose of determining eligibility for federal Medicaid benefits.  On May 15, 2015, Mr. Bell entered a revocable trust, naming Hallam as trustee, with the final judgment requiring her to consent to the transfer of assets for less than fair market value, regardless of whether the property transferred to her spouse was worth the same amount as the value of the property.  After a hearing on March 22, 2016, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the Commission's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and ordered the Commission to conduct an independent review of the matter. The Commission's examination, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of the Director of the Division of Family and Health Services. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Social Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, and the Missouri Office of Insurance Regulation."
