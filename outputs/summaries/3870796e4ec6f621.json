  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Guam today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a related action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Guam, alleges that, since 1940, the United States government has taken control of substantial amounts of privately owned land on Guam for military purposes during and immediately after World War II. At the time, many of the landowners received little or no compensation.  According to the complaint, the federal government took over substantial portions of the land for the purpose of constructing the Guam International Airport.  In 2000, the Guam legislature passed the Guam Ancestral Lands Act, which provided for the release of claims by ancestral landowners whose land had been taken and used for the airport.  As alleged, however, the legislation did not provide for a reasonable expectation of entitlement to the land.  For example, the complaint alleges that the land return provisions of the federal laws did not apply to the ancestral landowners, and that, in some instances, the land returned to the original owners or their heirs was not eligible for compensation at all.  Further, as alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the GIAA and Guam Land Repatriation Commission (GALC) failed to implement the GALC's land return policies.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Additionally, the court granted summary judgment against the defendants on the basis of those judgments against the other defendants.  On August 17, 2018, the Honorable Kathleen A. McGrath of the U. S. District Judge in the Northern District of New York granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment in the case against McGrath, agreeing to a permanent injunction, and appointing a receiver to determine the amount of compensation to be determined by the court upon motion of the Commission.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Guam Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Homeland Security in this matter."
