  "summary": "On October 23, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against the Smithsonian Institution and its director in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that the National Portrait Gallery (N.P.G.A.) rejected a portrait of Donald J. Trump from its collection in 2015.  According to the complaint, Mr. Raven, who is a member of the board of regents of the Smithsonian, was not entitled to a fair hearing for his work.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the Smithsonian's decision to reject his work violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the National Ponzi scheme is a classic example of a government-funded art project.  In its complaint, the court also found that the Smithsonian violated the First and Second Amendment of the federal securities laws by failing to adequately consider the merits of the artists' work, including whether they were qualified to participate in the selection of an art piece for display at the museum.  For example, the complaint alleges that, as a result of its refusal to consider the work, the Gallery was not permitted to display the portrait in its collection for the purpose of displaying it at the time it decided to reject it.  Additionally, the Court found that, in its order granting the Gallery's request for a temporary restraining order, it also ordered the Smithsonian to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, which would be equal to the amount of its disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  On October 24, 2017, the Honorable Judge David P. Currie of the United States District Court in Dallas issued an order suspending the suspension of the suspension pending final approval by the court of motion.   In a parallel action, on October 26, 2017 the U-S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.
