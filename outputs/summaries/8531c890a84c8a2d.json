  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found liable for defrauding a jury in a civil proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, alleges that Gertrude B. Link and her husband, Clifford L. Layne, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Link and Layne consented to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Link, Layne's wife, Carlynn Newcom, Don Durham, and Reed Durham.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Ms. Link was the sole beneficiary of the 1998 will and, in violation of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, the pre-judgment instruction that required the jury to determine whether a defendant was entitled to a judgment based on the facts of the case.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that the trial court improperly instructed the jury not to question the defendant in connection with his or her execution of the will because he had no reasonable explanation for why the jury should not question him in the first place.   The complaint further alleges that, in the course of deliberating, the jury was told that the defendant had a reasonable capacity to execute the will and that he had the duty to consider all of the facts presented to the jury in the final judgment.  However, the court did not consider whether the jury had reasonable reason to question Mr. Link in the second-half of the trial.  Instead, the SEC charged the jury with misappropriating evidence, and the jury found Link liable in the third-and-a-half-final judgment against him based on that finding.  On November 9, 2015, the Honorable Judge Robert Banks of the U. S. District court for the middle district of Tennessee issued a temporary restraining order halting the defendants from violating the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $10,000 and $20,000, respectively, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting, however, the defendants agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws and orders them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment"
