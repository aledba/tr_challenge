  "summary": "On May 29, 2019, the Ohio Court of Common Pleas entered a final judgment against the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODFS) against Daniel Sharp.  According to the court's order, on February 8, 2018, Daniel Sharp was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, and epilepsy without status epilepticus.  The court found that, based upon Daniel's history of seizures and diabetic ketoacidosis, he was not medically necessary to receive insulin.  As set forth in the order, Daniel's need for insulin treatment is not routine and requires the individual judgment of a healthcare provider.  In addition, the court found Daniel had a history of requiring insulin during his day-to-day care, which included frequent fluctuations in blood sugar readings and insulin doses.  Daniel's diabetes and epilepsy, along with his limited communication and reasoning abilities, caused him to experience frequent and wide fluctuations of glucose levels.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Daniel has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 24, 2019 the court entered a judgment against Daniel that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to comply with the court order.   The final judgment also orders Daniel to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5123:2-6-03(A).
