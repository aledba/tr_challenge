  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of Redwood City in favor of the District Attorney's Office's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other emergency relief.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Mateo County, California, on May 1, 2006, the city issued a PDP for a residential project called the Laurel Way Development Project (LDP). The PDP is intended to provide for the development of up to 16 homes on a private, dead end street known as Laurel Way. The complaint alleges that the city failed to evaluate the legal status of the lots under the PDP, and failed to file a final report with the court certifying the lots as in compliance with the requirements of the federal district court for the District of Columbia. The court also ruled that the LDP does not require a city to evaluate lot legality before granting development permits or preparing an EIR under CEQA.  The court's order, which is subject to court approval, prohibits the city from issuing any final judgment on the merits of the litigation.  In its order, the court also ordered the city to provide a copy of the final PDP to the court for review.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the City consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The final judgment also prohibits the City from issuing or preparing any final report on the issues raised by the complaint. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Bort. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The examination that led to the decision was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center, with the assistance of the California Office of Planning and Zoning Regulation.\u00c2\u00a0 The case was supervised by Eric R. Werner, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and Trial Counsel for the Los Angeles Regional Office."
