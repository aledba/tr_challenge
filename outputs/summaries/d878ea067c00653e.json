  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon for failing to timely respond to a request for a speedy trial.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that, on June 16, 2016, a Mercer County jury indicted Shane P. Irish on two counts of securities fraud.  According to the complaint, Irish, who was incarcerated in the Belmont Correctional Institution in Ohio at the time of the alleged scheme, was unaware of the untried indictment when he entered his no contest plea.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Irish was unaware that the indictment was pending against him and that he had been incarcerated for unrelated offenses prior to his arrest.   The complaint further alleges that while Irish was incarcerated, he did not become aware of the pending charges and did not file a motion to dismiss until he was served with a final disposition of the case.  As a result, Irish was not adequately prepared to respond to the jury's recommendation for a timely response.  Finally, the SEC alleges that the delay was not sufficient to warrant the imposition of a penalty, as alleged in the complaint.  For example, the court found that Irish violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Irish to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his imprisonment.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Irish consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar against him.  On October 12, 2018, the Ohio Court of Criminal Appeals entered a judgment against Irish, finding that he was liable to a penalty of five years imprisonment, ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against him from further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws.  It also ordered him to sign a \"Waiver of Constitutional Rights\" form, which provides, among other things, that the court will determine whether to impose a penalty based on reasonable diligence and whether to issue an order suspending or otherwise imposing a bar against Irish.  Additionally, the Court ordered that Irish pay a $1,000 civil penalty, which is subject to approval by the court upon motion of the court, and that Irish be restrained from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the pending criminal charges. \u00c2\u00a0The court also ordered Irish"
