  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the House of Representatives' motion for a temporary restraining order against the federal government's planned construction of a border wall.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, Arizona, on January 6, 2019, President Donald J. Trump declared that \"a national emergency exists at the southern border of the United States\" and that Congress had the power to determine how and when to allocate federal funds.  The complaint alleges that the House had standing to challenge the President's declaration of an emergency and the allocation of funds to build the wall, but the House did not have standing to do so.  Instead, the complaint alleges, the House and the Executive Branch used the same legal tools as the federal courts to determine whether a federal law was unconstitutional.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that, contrary to the House's claims, the Senate has the right to revoke the president's emergency declaration and to issue an order suspending the issuance of the emergency declaration.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, however, the court has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining the House from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the House to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the penalty imposed by the court on the individual members of Congress.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Arizona State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Arizona Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor alert system to quickly spot suspicious patterns of activity.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the U.N. Secret Service today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing partial government shutdown, which has shut down the agency for the first time in over a decade.  On February 15, 2019 the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, charging the House with violations of Section 5 of the federal securities laws, including Section 284 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Section 2808 of the Department of Homeland Security's \"statistical sampling\" program. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. "
