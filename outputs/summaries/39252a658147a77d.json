  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against Franks Construction Company, L.L.C., a New Orleans-based construction contractor, for failing to comply with a court order requiring it to intervene in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Franks Construction violated the antifraud provisions of the Louisiana Limited Liability Act (LLA) and the general discovery provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Franks Construction failed to disclose that it had entered into three subcontracts with RAC totaling $6,691,448.00, and that it spent an additional 305 days on the project and incurred total damages in the amount of $8,372,629.00.  Franks Construction also alleges that, as the owner of the property, it had failed to pay RAC the total amount due for the work it had performed on the Project.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the Complaint alleges that the District Court improperly granted Franks Construction's request for an emergency court order to compel the construction contractor to produce documents that could be used to determine whether Franks Construction had a right of action to intervene.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's Judgment, Franks and RAC consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders Franks Construction to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Franks.  On June 16, 2017, a federal district court in Orleans, Louisiana, entered a judgment granting Franks Construction a temporary restraining order preventing it from violating the anti-fraud provision of the LLA and ordering it to pay civil penalties of $2,500,000 and $1 million, respectively.   The judgment also orders Franks to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $192,768.00 and a civil monetary penalty of a total of $3,500.00; Franks has agreed to settle the case by consenting to an injunction that prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any construction materials, and to pay an officer and director bar.  Additionally, the court has ordered Franks to provide a copy of the Judgment to be filed with the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 2451."
