  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Johnny C. Baker, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to a five-year prison term.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, Baker was charged with felonious assault, domestic violence, and kidnapping for allegedly detaining his girlfriend against her will and beating her.  The complaint alleges that Baker agreed to a three-year sentence without admitting or denying the allegations in the indictment.  Baker also agreed to be sentenced to five years of community control, which is mandatory under the federal securities laws.  As alleged in the complaint, however, neither the indictment nor the bill of particulars specified any underlying, predicate felony, and the prosecutor's recitation at the plea hearing did not identify one of the underlying felony.  In addition, Baker alleges that he did not want to withdraw his prior guilty plea because he understood the nature of the kidnapping charge and the risk in doing so was that the trial court would review the record, including the PSI report, and conclude that Baker's offense warranted a prison term longer than three years.   The SEC's Complaint against Baker, which was unsealed today, charges him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting to these allegations, Baker consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar.  On November 22, 2017, the court granted Baker's request for a preliminary injunction and ordered him to appear for sentencing on December 21, 2017. The court also ordered Baker to comply with the court's order to schedule a hearing for December 24, 2017 to consider whether to proceed with the sentencing.  A hearing scheduled for December 26, 2017 is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. EST. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, the Ohio Department of Justice Criminal Division, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, Criminal Investigations Division, and State Attorney General's Office in the Eastern District of New York to conduct an examination of Baker's past criminal history. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment."
