  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former cabinet maker who was found to have severe spinal stenosis.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, on September 24, 2013, a retired cabinet maker was found unable to perform any work due to a spinal fusion surgery.  The complaint alleges that Dr. Amrani, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon who performed the cervical fusion surgery in April 2015, failed to provide any basis for discrediting him for his inability to perform work related to his condition.  In addition, the SEC alleges that, contrary to his earlier opinion, Dr. Kearney failed to show that he had severe carpal tunnel syndrome, which is a form of spinal stenotic disease that causes severe pain and pressure in the neck and back.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Ostrove and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by G.A. Leusch and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York and the Department of Health and Human Services."
