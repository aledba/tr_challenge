  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (DFS) for terminating the parental rights of two children who were removed from their mother's care by court order.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that, in August 2017, the DFS terminated the children's parental rights to D.R.P. and H.I.P., who were eight and five years old respectively.  According to the complaint, Mother attempted suicide by overdose in front of her children, used a prescription drug not prescribed to the children to make them sleep, tested positive for cocaine, and smoked crack cocaine. The complaint alleges that at the time of the termination, Mother had not completed her service plan for the children and had to be located by law enforcement to determine whether she was in the best interest of the children.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Mother.  On December 7, 2018, the trial court entered an order terminating the children from being in the custody of the Department ofFS. The court found that Mother violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Mother consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to comply with the court order, and imposing a conduct-based injunction against her from violating the above-mentioned provisions. The final judgment also ordered Mother to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing on December 13, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. Eastern. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
