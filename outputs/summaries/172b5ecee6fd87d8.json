  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment against a defendant who allegedly made two false statements to a friend in an election flyer about a Washington, D.C. wedding venue.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that defendant made two online statements about the case that were sympathetic to her friend.  According to the complaint, the defendants made the statements in response to a Facebook post by Ferguson, who was also a friend of the defendant.  As alleged in the complaint:  The defendants made these statements in a single post on the website of The Columbian, and, shortly after the trial, defendant posted a comment on Ferguson's Facebook page after the jury acquitted plaintiff of the charges.   The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that defendants violated Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of that Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  A hearing is scheduled for May 5, 2017.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 567, 572-73, 323 P.3d 521. \u00c2\u00a0On May 9, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered a temporary restraining order against defendant, ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On May 10, 2020, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 17 (a)(2) of\u00c2\u00a0The Securities Act of 1933, and Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, a conduct-based injunction, and a penny stock bar against defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with an offering or offering of any security, including the right to reapply as an officer and director of a public company after five years of service.  To settle the SEC case, the defendant agreed to a permanent restraining order and to a $2,500 civil penalty and to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a public figure. "
