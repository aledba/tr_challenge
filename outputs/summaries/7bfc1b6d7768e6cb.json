  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Arizona announced today that it has obtained a court order halting an ongoing criminal case against Supranom Klos.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Tucson, Arizona, alleges that Klos, a native Thai speaker who began to learn English when she moved to the United States in 1975, made numerous self-incriminating statements to the FBI during an interrogation. Klos allegedly told the FBI that she had difficulty understanding \u201chard words\u201d but she could read and write in English at a tenth-grade level and had spent tens of thousands of dollars on dental implants and a luxury vehicle for herself. According to the complaint, Klos also allegedly claimed that in the days before she was arrested, she had taken over $200,000 of the victim\u2019s money from her bank accounts to an account jointly in her own name at a different financial institution. The complaint further alleges Klos did not express surprise at the amount of the amount and admitted she had not used the money for the victim's benefit.  Klos ultimately agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay a civil penalty of $311,833.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,078, which represents Klos' ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced criminal charges against Klos arising from the same conduct alleged in the Complaint. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Arizona Division of Criminal Investigations.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Arizona Department of Criminal Justice, and the Arizona State Attorney General's Office."
