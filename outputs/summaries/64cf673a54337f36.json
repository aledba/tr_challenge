  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against two individuals for defrauding a jury in a wrongful death case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Elba Janeth Jimenez, who killed the children's mother while driving drunk, and Maria Elena Rodriguez, who negligently entrusted her car to Jimenez's, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Jimenez and Rodriguez agreed to settle the case by agreeing to pay $11,250,000 each in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their respective losses.  Jimenez also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Rodriguez and Jimenez have agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jimenez.  On June 16, 2012, a jury found Jimenez liable for the death of Claudia Fernandez, who died in a car accident. The jury found that Jimenez was not okay to drive and ordered Jimenez to pay a $7.5 million civil penalty. The court also found that Rodriguez was liable for liability for the decedent's prior DUI conviction for which she had agreed to disgorge her ill-gotten gains, and that Rodriguez had consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay civil penalties of $11.250 million, $5,625,000 for past and future damages, and $7,145,376 in pre-judgment interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To determine whether to proceed with the litigation, the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the California Department of Insurance, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
