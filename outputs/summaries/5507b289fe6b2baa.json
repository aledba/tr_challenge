  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment in favor of terminating the parental rights of a Texas mother and her two younger children.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the Department's representations to the court, mother and father did not violate Section 161.001 of the Family Code. Rather, the complaint alleges that mother violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by failing to comply with the Department\u2019s requests for termination of her parental rights. According to the complaint, mother also failed to take medication consistently for her bipolar disorder and failed to complete a family service plan. In addition, mother has been incarcerated for two state felony theft cases, and she anticipated being released in November 2018. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mother. The SEC also announced that it would conduct a civil injunctive action against Mother, charging her with violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 15b2-3 thereunder, and ordering her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also issued an order freezing the assets of Mother and father, barring them from future securities law enforcement activities, and from participating in any offering of penny stock or penny stock.  In a related administrative proceeding, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced parallel criminal prosecutions against Mother and Father-in-law. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson, and supervised by C.J. W. Hershfang of the Fort Worth office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Office of Child and Family Education and Advocacy."
