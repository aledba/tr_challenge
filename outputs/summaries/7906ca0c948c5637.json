  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against Alex Luna for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that, in 2006, Luna was charged with two counts of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute, 50 grams or more of crack cocaine, in violation of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the SEC alleges that Luna was also charged with a third count of possession of a controlled substance, which in turn was related to a previously imposed term of imprisonment for which Luna was convicted.  In addition, the complaint alleges that when Luna was sentenced on count one, he was convicted on count two, which is a \"covered offense\" and, therefore, qualifies him to a plenary resentencing under the First Step Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Luna has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of five years' imprisonment, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  He has also agreed to a bifurcated settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2).  The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 545, 556 (Jan. 26, 2019).  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained an asset freeze against Luna, which has allowed the SEC to obtain a temporary restraining order against him from further violations of Section 922. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Luna.  On May 15, 2019, a federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, entered a judgment against Luna ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The court found that Luna violated Section 404 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which requires a court to determine whether a defendant is eligible to impose a penalty based on the amount of a drug, and that the court can impose a \"total punishment\" upon the defendant based on those findings.  Among other things, the court also ordered Luna to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,"
