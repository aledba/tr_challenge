  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of second-degree murder and using a firearm in a criminal case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, Tshibangu Kazadi, a resident of Baltimore, used a series of false statements to convince a jury that he was innocent of the charges brought against him.  The SEC alleges that, in a parallel action, the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that a jury should determine whether a defendant has a right to cross-examination based on his or her immigration status and whether he or she has a duty or responsibility to testify on behalf of the state.  In its judgment, the court held that the jury had the right to determine whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of a reasonable basis for a reasonable response to a question posed by the jury.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, S.L.H. and her son, M.L., consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  On January 19, 2016, the trial court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction against the defendant and ordered him to comply with the court's order, ordering him to surrender his passport, pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and be barred from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  A hearing scheduled for Feb. 13, 2019, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  An examination that followed the examination was conducted in the absence of any corroborating evidence, and the jury was not allowed to question the defendant.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 4-263 (2014).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Office of the United States District Judge in Baltimore."
