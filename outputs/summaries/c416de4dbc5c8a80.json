  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a company that terminated its relationship with a member of a multi-employer bargaining unit.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that the Pacific Crane Maintenance Company (PCMC) and its subsidiary, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (ILWU), violated Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by failing to recognize IAM as the union representative for the employees performing maintenance and repair work at the three West Coast-wide terminals.  In addition, the complaint alleges that PCMC and ILWU failed to bargain collectively with IAM, despite the fact that IAM was already bound by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the employer.  According to the complaint, after the merger was announced, IAM terminated its contract with PMMC, which required it to recognize the union represented by IAM at the Oakland and Tacoma terminals. The complaint also alleges that PMMC and IAM did not bargain collectively as a result of IAM's termination, and instead hired six additional former PMMC mechanics to do the same M&R work at three newly acquired Maersk terminals. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On March 30, 2005, the SEC issued its final judgment, ordering PCMC to pay $130,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of money paid to the defendants in the SEC's action.   The court's order also imposed a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest in the amounts of money they received from the sale of the contracts.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any securities in the future. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner."
