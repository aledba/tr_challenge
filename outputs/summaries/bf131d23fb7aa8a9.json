The court entered a final judgment against Mother on April 5, 2018, that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 53(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder, and orders her to pay $500 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In its order, the court also ordered Mother to pay a $1,500 civil penalty.  According to the court's order, Mother failed to comply with the order, and the court ultimately granted her custody without admitting or denying the allegations in her complaint.

The court also granted Mother a temporary restraining order, barring her from participating in any child custody proceedings, and ordering her to provide an accounting of the amount of her alleged ill-gotten gains with respect to her son, I.W.B., born in August 2014.
