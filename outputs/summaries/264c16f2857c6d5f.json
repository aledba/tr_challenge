Moore, a California resident, began exhibiting provocative, oppositional, and destructive behaviors shortly after a head injury sustained in February 1985. The complaint further alleges that shortly after the head injury, Moore began exhibiting aggressive and oppositional behaviors, including aggressive and aggressive aggressive aggressive behavior, self-injury and attempted suicide, and attempted self-dealing. According to the complaint, Moore was unable to access the services provided by a regional center because he was not a qualifying \"developmental disability\" and that he did not have a \"substantial disability.\" The complaint alleges that Moore violated the antifraud provisions of Section 4512 of the Lanterman Act and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Moore agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000. Moore also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The litigation will be led by Samantha C. Moore and Ms. Moore. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Developmental Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
