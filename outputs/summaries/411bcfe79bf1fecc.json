  "summary": "On April 20, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that the VA violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and Rules 5b-5 and 5c-8 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that, in promulgating the VA's July 2017 Revised Rule, the Secretary improperly waived the notice-and-comment and 30-day delayed effective date requirements of the APA, and that the Secretary violated the hiring and hiring rules of the federal government.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the Secretary of VA.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on January 10, 2000, the VA changed the name of the agency to the Vocational Rehabilitation and Counseling Service (VR & E) to reflect the need for psychometric tests as part of the VA\u2019s statutory obligations to provide rehabilitation services to veterans. The VA previously hired Counseling Psychologists under the VR & E under the Psychology Series under the Social Science Series, but in July 2017, the agency terminated the hiring of a new group of CPs under the new name. The Department of Veteran Affairs announced the suspension of the VR&E, which had been in place since January 2000. The department also instituted a hiring freeze and other administrative relief, including a temporary restraining order, to prevent future violations of the anti-fraud provisions. The SEC also instituted an internal investigation, which is continuing. The litigation will be led by Vincent C. Hershfang and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The case is being supervised by Marc Blau, Chief of the Office of Inspector General, and John Rymas of the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Department of Health and Human Services, and the Virginia Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
