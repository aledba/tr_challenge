  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against a defendant in an affordable housing case.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 8-30g of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in East Haven, Connecticut, the defendants submitted an application on December 20, 2012, that sought to amend the East Haven zoning regulations to create a new \"mixed income housing\" zone, to construct 105 detached single-family homes in common interest ownership with thirty-two homes deed restricted for forty years, and to approve a site plan for a new development with a new drainage system.  As alleged in the complaint, defendants failed to adequately consider the risks to human health and safety posed by the proposed development and failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their denial of the application.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant failed to respond to the Commission's requests for a hearing on the merits of the case, or to provide a reasonable explanation for why the Commission denied the defendants' application. The complaint further alleges that, in preparing the application, Autumn View, LLC (Autumn View) and Statewide Construction Corporation (SBCC) reviewed the materials prepared by Jacobsen Associates and determined that the proposed site plan was within the scope of the District Court's remand order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal anti-fraud provisions and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,038,767, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On May 29, 2016, the court granted the defendants a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return to court on July 24, 2017.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael R. Wisniowski and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Office of Planning and Zoning Regulation."
