  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against a Kentucky State Police detective who allegedly conducted an unregistered custodial interrogation of a two-year-old Kentucky boy.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky on April 5, 2016, alleges that E.C., who was thirteen years old at the time, was questioned at the Cabinet's Office of Health and Family Services (COHFS) on August 21, 2014, four days prior to the meeting in question. According to the complaint, the defendant told the officer that he had seen his father having sex about three times and that he smacked his mother\u2019s face when he tried to touch him. The complaint further alleges that the defendant denied having ever had sex with anyone his own age, and that his mother had never asked him to leave her house after he was alleged to have engaged in a sexual assault. The SEC also alleges that, on the day of the alleged incident, when the defendant came downstairs to use the restroom, he had blood on his penis.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the alleged victim was not in custody when the alleged abuse allegedly took place, and the defendant was not present at the meeting when the complaint was filed.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against E. C.    The case was investigated by the Kentucky Office of the Chief of the Criminal Investigations and was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Brunson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Department of Justice in this matter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kentucky Attorney General's Office, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and other emergency relief agencies."
