  "summary": "On May 31, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a former pharmacist who was found eligible for unemployment compensation.  According to the court's order, filed on June 26, 2018, David L. Lisco (Claimant) was terminated from his employment as a pharmacist for excessive use of the internet while working. The court found that Lisco was entitled to the presumption of receipt when, in fact, he was not entitled to that presumption because he did not receive the notice of hearing.  The court also found that, unlike in the present case, Ms. Krysakowski could not testify to writing and addressing the specific letter at issue and, moreover, could not identify how the letter was entered into the mail.  In addition, as alleged in the court order, she could not provide testimony about how the notices entered the mail or whether they had proper postage affixed to them.  As a result, the court found Lisco ineligible to receive benefits and ordered a remand hearing for March 12, 2018.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, Lisco consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Lisco also agreed to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the Commission's order.  Additionally, the Court issued a temporary restraining order against Lisco from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to comply with the court-ordered injunction, and appointing a receiver to oversee the issuance and processing of Commission orders.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Philadelphia Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
