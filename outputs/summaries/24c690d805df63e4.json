  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment ordering the Florida Attorney General to conduct a limited review of a proposed citizen initiative amendment to the Florida Constitution and the corresponding financial impact statement prepared by the Financial Impact Estimating Conference (FIEC).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that the Florida Secretary of State's Office issued a false and misleading press release announcing the filing of an initiative petition.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on September 6, 2019, the Florida secretary of state's office issued a press release stating that the SEC had jurisdiction to review initiative petitions and financial impact statements.  The complaint further alleges that, in reality, the SEC did not have jurisdiction to determine whether a citizen initiative petition was valid and whether it should be included on the ballot.  In addition, as alleged in the complaint, the state Attorney General's Office has no jurisdiction to conduct an independent review of initiative petitions.  To determine whether the SEC has jurisdiction to do so, the Attorney General must first request an opinion from the court regarding the compliance of the proposed amendment with the single-subject rule, the accuracy of the ballot title and summary with the substantive and technical requirements of section 101.161(1), Florida Statutes (2018), and the jurisdiction to issue an advisory opinion.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, however, the attorney general has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000 and a civil penalty of $100,000, and to pay a $20,000 civil penalty.  On September 7, 2019 the SEC filed an emergency action against the Florida attorney general, charging him with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b2-2 and 13a-14 thereunder and with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, penny stock bars, and officer-and-director bars from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer or sale of any investment in any Florida-based business, and penny stock bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Department of State Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Internal Revenue Service."
