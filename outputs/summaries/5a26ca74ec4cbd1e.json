  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against a Connecticut woman who claimed that she was an unfit parent in order to relinquish guardianship of her son.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut on February 28, 2018, Kristi F. of Connecticut and her husband, Jorge P. Golding, Jr., of Connecticut, raised the issue of whether to reinstate the guardianship rights of Zakai.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to the court's findings, Golding and Golding failed to apply the \"clear and convincing evidence standard\" required by the federal securities laws to determine whether a child should be placed in the care and custody of a parent.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Connecticut today announced criminal charges against Golding for his role in the alleged misconduct.  On March 1, 2019, the court granted the respondent's motion for reinstatement of guardianship, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, for the first time in more than a decade.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, the respondent had been rehabilitated and was able to provide for her family when she was under the control of her live-in boyfriend, Montreal C., while the respondent was in the custody of the child. The court found that the respondent violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Golding violated her duty to the child and to the parent by failing to consider the safety and security of her relationship with the child when evaluating whether to revoke her guardianship.  Golding also failed to consider that, based on the facts as presented to him by the court, she was not in the best interest of her child to be relinquished to her care and custodial rights.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the New Haven Regional Office by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Jason J. Burt of the Division of Justice's Cyber Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families in this matter."
