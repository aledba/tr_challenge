  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a parallel action brought by New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Schneiderman violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Schneiderman has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  According to the complaint, Schneiderman also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the anti-fishing provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(c), and 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.

The SEC also issued an order suspending Schneiderman from appearing before the SEC as an attorney. The Court's order also temporarily froze Schneiderman & Hannan's assets and ordered that he pay a civil penalty of $10,000. Schneiderman agreed to a $75,000 settlement. The settlements are subject to Court approval.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a return of the defendants' allegedly illegal profits, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the operation of the New York-based harvesting companies.
