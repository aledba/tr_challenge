  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of first-degree sexual assault.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Lincoln, Nebraska, alleges that defendant Wilder A. Alvarado violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from March 17, 2017 to March 18, 2017, Alvarados allegedly engaged in a sexual act with a woman who had been diagnosed with genital herpes. The complaint alleges that the alleged victim fell down a steep staircase leading to her second-floor apartment and was subsequently diagnosed with herpes.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant did not consent to the entry of the final judgment, and the defendant was subsequently arrested and sentenced to 25 to 35 years imprisonment with credit for 298 days served.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint filed in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York, the SEC has agreed to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Alvarada.  On March 19, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation entered a temporary restraining order and issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The court also ordered the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the case and to determine whether it was appropriate to issue a civil injunctive action.  Among other things, the court ordered that the SEC determine whether to impose a penalty based on the facts of the matter.  A hearing on March 24, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The hearing was delayed until after the SEC examination that led to the determination of the appropriate penalty was conducted by the court.  During the examination that followed, the jury was instructed not to question the gynecologist regarding the exhibits relating to the herpes virus. The jury deliberated for a total of five hours before it was scheduled to consider whether to issue an order imposing an injunction, imposing an order requiring the defendant to surrender his passport, and ordering the examination of B.H.\u2019s genitals.   The court found that the evidence presented to the SEC was insufficient to support a conviction for first degree sexual assault of a child. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David A. Basinger in the Denver Regional Office."
