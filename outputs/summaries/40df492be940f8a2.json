  "summary": "On June 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against three men who were convicted of using a noxious chemical spray to subdue victims in a New York City bank holdup.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Fernando Sandel, Isaias Rivera and Joey Cruz used the noxious substance pepper spray in a series of bank robberies, including one that left one woman gasping for air, and another that injured a security guard.  According to the complaint, Sandel and Cruz also allegedly used a can of mace, which is not a dangerous chemical, to pepper spray victims.  In one instance, the complaint alleges that the defendants sprayed their victims in the face with pepper spray and then tied their wrists and ankles to prevent them from opening their eyes and attempting to flush out the chemical from the victims' faces.  As alleged, the defendants' actions were so severe that they were unable to breathe.  On September 30, 2015, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return to New York to be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered them to pay disgorgement of $10,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint filed in the SEC, the three defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any public company, and impose a $75,000 civil penalty against each of them. The court also granted the defendants the right to reapply for a hearing in the future on the same matter as the final judgment.   In a separate case, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against a bank robber who used pepper spray on several of his victims leaving one woman with severe burns to her face and eyes, and ordering him to pay a $50,000 penalty. The SEC also issued an order suspending the sale and registration of certain types of \"dangerous\" non-lethal chemical spray, including pepper spray, for a period of five years.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 2, 2018. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper."
