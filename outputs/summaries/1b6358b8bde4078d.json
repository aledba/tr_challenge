  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a New Jersey man for his role in the death of his daughter.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, N.J., alleges that, on the morning of March 14, 2011, a jury found defendant Andrew L. Lilavois guilty of two counts of murder and one count of attempted second-degree murder.  According to the complaint, the jury deliberated for approximately nine-and-one-half hours, with the majority of the time spent on the phone with the defendant, during which time defendant allegedly engaged in a series of verbal and physical confrontations with the jury.  In one instance, the complaint alleges that defendant repeatedly kicked and punched his daughter in the chest, causing a fatal liver injury.  During the trial, the court found that defendant had no history of prior criminal convictions, and that he had not engaged in any prior misconduct with a juror, despite repeated requests from the jury to do so.   The complaint further alleges that the jury was not adequately trained in the subject matter of the case and that defendant failed to adequately assess the impact of the juror's actions on the jury's deliberation.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties he will pay in a parallel criminal case.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.  For example, the SEC\u00c2\u00a0recently issued an Investor Alert warning investors to be aware of the potential for fraud in the securities industry.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Financial Regulation today announced that it has issued a\u00c2\u00a0statement\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
