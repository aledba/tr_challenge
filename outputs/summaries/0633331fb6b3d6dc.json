  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of North Carolina's mandatory lifetime SBM program, which requires individuals to register as a sex offender with the Department of Justice for the purpose of obtaining a warrant to search their homes.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina on May 24, 2017, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order halting the program.  The court also issued an order suspending the program pending final approval of the court's order.  In its order, the court found that the program violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the individual to comply with the requirements of Section 14-208 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 26, 2018, the Honorable Kathleen M. Burns of the United States District Court in Charlotte issued an Order suspending the suspension of the program and ordering it to be conducted by the Division of Criminal Justice, with the assistance of the Office of Inspector General's Cyber Unit.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Ms. Burns and Ms. Gibson, and the case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (2014).  The case has been supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Cyber Unit, under the supervision of John R. Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office, with assistance from Eric R. Werner of the Division's Office of Advocacy and Public Education.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages the public to check the backgrounds of people participating in a criminal investigation by using the free and simple search tool on http://www.sec.gov/report.php.
