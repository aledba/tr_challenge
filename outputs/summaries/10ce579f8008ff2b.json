  "summary": "On September 14, 2018, the Missouri Court of Appeals entered a final judgment against Missourians to Protect the Missouri Constitution, finding that the Missouri Initiative Petition violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that the Initiative Petition was defective for failing to accurately identify the provisions of the federal law that govern the allocation of state legislative districts.  According to the court's order, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri, the proposed amendment would impose a two-year waiting period before legislators and legislative employees could serve as paid lobbyists, and require the commission to adopt a final reapportionment plan by the end of the calendar year.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from violating these provisions, and orders the Commission to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $2,500. The Commission has also agreed to pay $1,500 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Ritter and Mehan, ordering them to comply with the Commission\u2019s order, and ordering the Commission not to violate the anti-fraud provision of the Commission Act.  On September 19, 2018 the court granted the Commission the right to respond to a request for an emergency court order and issued an order suspending the Commission and ordering it to conduct a hearing on the matter.  A hearing for the Commission is scheduled for October 17, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.
