  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against defendant Antonio Salazar, Jr., who was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol and sentenced to 12 months in prison.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Lubbock, New Mexico, Salazar violated the antifraud provisions of Section 66-8-102(A) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.

The order also prohibits Salazar from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order. The Court also issued an order suspending Salazar and Sansone from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert in drug analysis.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court in New Mexico alleging that, based on the facts of the case, the District Court improperly held that a jury should not be required to draw blood without first obtaining a warrant, that a warrant should be obtained from a convicted felon, that an officer or director of a public company must obtain a warrant and establish probable cause and exigent circumstances to justify a warrant-less search.
