  "summary": "On June 18, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment ordering Philadelphia-based nonprofit organization, Christian Legal Services, Inc. (CSS), to comply with a federal order requiring it to provide services to same-sex couples.  According to the court's order, CSS agreed to be exempt from the mandatory student-activity fee and to be barred from serving as an unregistered broker-dealer.  The court also issued an order requiring CSS to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  In its order, the court found that CSS violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, CSS consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2,500.  Additionally, the Court granted the request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 13(b)(5) and (c) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and ordered the SEC to conduct an independent examination of all of CSS's books and records to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support a finding of neutrality in this matter.  On June 21, 2018 the court granted the SEC the right to request a temporary restraining order and an order appointing a receiver to oversee CSS's compliance with Section 12 of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20 thereunder, as well as the appointment of a receiver for CSS's continuing compliance with the federal requirements under Section 12. The SEC's order also provides for the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order, which requires the court to determine the nature of any violation of Section 12 and the scope of the complaint.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-20.  Separately, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against CSS.  An SEC complaint filed in federal court in Philadelphia charges CSS with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  A hearing scheduled for July 26, 2018 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  To learn more about religious targeting, see litigation release No. 12."
