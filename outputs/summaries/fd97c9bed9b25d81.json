  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Narkiewicz-Laine, a Galena, Illinois resident who brought a civil injunctive action against the defendants for the destruction of his artwork and personal property.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 2004, the defendants emptied the rental space and discarded the majority of the artwork and other personal property in the unit. The complaint further alleges that the defendants improperly allowed the defendants to impeach his expert witness by asking a question that improperly characterized him as an \u201cart felon.\u201d  The court ultimately agreed to the defendants\u2019 request for a new trial on the same charges, and the defendants agreed to settle the case by agreeing to pay $120,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, totaling $1.2 million. The SEC also agreed to a $100,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Narki-Lau.  According to the SEC, the jury deliberated for less than six hours before finding that the jury should consider the evidence of the defendants who had destroyed the artwork in the rental unit and awarded him $120 million in damages. The court also found that the defendant had failed to adequately consider the value of the work that he had lost in the destruction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-11 (January 21, 2019).  The U. S. Attorney\u2018s Office For the Southern Division of New Jersey today announced parallel criminal charges.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Brunson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois Department of Justice in this matter."
