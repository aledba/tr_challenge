  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Alain Pinel Realtors, Inc. (Pinel) and certain managing owners and brokers in connection with a real estate contract arbitration case. The court found that Pinel violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and entered into sub-licensing agreements with Fidelity National Home Warranty Company of California, which allowed those entities to contract their settlement services to Pinel clients using TransactionPoint. According to the court's order, after Pinel engaged in a transaction to buy or sell a home in California, he entered into a sub-registration agreement with a broker that required the broker to initial the arbitration provision. The complaint alleges that the broker initially provided the arbitration agreement to the broker, but failed to provide any evidence that he had initialed the arbitration clause. In addition, the court found no evidence of any arbitration provision in the complaint, and Pinel and all individual defendants have failed to show that they had violated Section 1550 of the Exchange Act and Rule 1550. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, charges Pinel, certain managing owner and brokers, and Fidelity with violating Section 1298(a), and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Pinel has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The court also granted the SEC\u2019s request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Pinel.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans entered an order permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged securities laws and ordering him to comply with the court order. The order also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any real estate, including residential property, without first obtaining a court order or requiring a court-ordered injunction. The Court also ordered Pinel to provide a copy of the arbitration order to the American Arbitration Association, which is pending approval by the court. The case is being supervised by San Francisco District Attorney Robert A. Kasper."
