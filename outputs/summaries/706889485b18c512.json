  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against Ryan Cole Stone, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for a second-degree felony.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that, in January 2016, Stone, a Colorado resident, stole a car and led the Colorado State Patrol on a high-speed chase around the metro area. The complaint alleges that the trooper was not entitled to permanent partial disability benefits because he was not a victim, and that he had no incentive to reimburse the state for the trooper's travel expenses.  According to the complaint, however, the trooper did pay restitution to the state, and the restitution order was based on the amount of restitution that the state paid to the trooper.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Stone.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Stone consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $252,027.69 plus prejudgment interest of $979.41 and a civil penalty of $250,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2019, the court granted Stone's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 18-1.3-603 of the federal securities laws. The court also granted Stone a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, and a penny stock bar against him. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, the Denver Police Department, the Criminal Investigations Division, the Department of Justice Criminal Division's Office of Inspector General, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Colorado Office of the Attorney General."
