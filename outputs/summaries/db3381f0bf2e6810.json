  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Tyco Integrated Security, LLC and three other companies for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Tyco and the Alarm Companies violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") by failing to provide reasonable, reasonable, and reasonable assurances that the defendants were entitled to relief under the Contracts Clause of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Tyco, for example, had been in the RSS business for five years, and had an almost decade-old exclusive arrangement with NWCDS, under which it would pay a fee for each account it links to the RSS model.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  Tyco also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in any future securities law enforcement action.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in the Southern Division of New Jersey entered a preliminary injunction and ordered Tyco to comply with the court order. The court also issued an order suspending Tyco from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney in a case that was being handled by the SEC.  A hearing scheduled for June 21, 2019, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  An SEC examination that followed the SEC examination was conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Insurance, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Chicago Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
