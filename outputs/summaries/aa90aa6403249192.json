  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Elk Hills Power, LLC (Elk Hills), a California-based company that owns and operates an independent power plant.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, Elk Hills was required to assess the value of its intangible assets and rights when valuing the powerplant.  The complaint alleges that, in failing to do so, the company improperly overstated the fair market value of those intangible assets in its unitary value of the unit.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that the company failed to include in its valuation a value of \"intangible rights\" that are necessary to the productive use of the property.  As alleged in the complaint, the district's valuation of the plant was based on valuation assumptions that failed to account for the presence of these intangible rights.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Elk Hills consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $100,000.  Elk Hills also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  Elkh Hills agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering it to provide for an accounting of its assets and reserves, and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Roehm and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Ms. Basinger. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the California Office of the Secretary of State's Office."
