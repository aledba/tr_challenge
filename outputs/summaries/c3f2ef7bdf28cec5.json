  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against a New York City man who was convicted of child pornography and, while awaiting sentencing, molested a four year old boy in his friend's care.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, John Doe, a registered sex offender, began watching pornography on a public library computer on March 5, 2009. The complaint alleges that, while watching the video, Doe began to tell his friend that he had touched the boy's penis, and that Doe then told the friend that Doe \"touched Mr. Winkie\" when he was outside with the boy earlier in the day. Doe also allegedly stated in the presence of a police officer that Doe had touched him, reported the same later on the same day, and then again when confronted by the officer. The SEC's final judgment, which permanently enjoins Doe from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, orders him to comply with the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The final judgment also prohibits Doe from serving as an officer or director of a public agency and from participating in the issuance of any officer-director or director-registration program.  The court also ordered Doe to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC announced criminal charges against Doe.  To learn more about child sex offenders, see Litigation Release No. 10800, 459 Mass. at 632, 947 N.E.2d 1263.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of the United States District Judge in Boston. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The court will determine the amount of monetary penalties to be imposed by the court upon motion of the SEC."
