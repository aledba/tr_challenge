  "summary": "On July 15, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawai'i entered a final judgment against Marcia Wilson, charging her with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Hawai\u2018i, charged Wilson with operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant.  According to the complaint, Wilson agreed to participate in a colloquy with a defendant before accepting the stipulation without consulting with the defendant.  Wilson also agreed to submit a form on which to indicate whether she would submit to a breath, blood, or urine test.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Wilson consented to the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $500,000 officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Hawaii today announced criminal charges against Wilson.  On July 16, 2018, the Honorable Kathleen M. Burns of the Umpqua Regional Office in Honolulu issued an order suspending Wilson from appearing or practicing before a trial court as part of a case-by-case review.  Judge Burns granted the court's motion for a temporary restraining order, ordered Wilson to surrender her passport, and ordered her to return to her home state of Hawaii, where she resides.   The court's order also temporarily suspended Wilson from participating in the trial of a defendant who had been convicted of an OVI-related felony.  As part of the settlement, the court agreed to a permanent injunction against Wilson and to the imposition of a civil penalty of $250,000, which is equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17.  Separately, the SEC filed an amended complaint in the parallel criminal case against Wilson, alleging that Wilson violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by failing to comply with a court order suspending her from appearing and practicing before the court as a trial attorney.  This amended complaint charges Wilson with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a penny-per-share bar against Wilson"
