  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of home invasion, home invasion and possession of a stolen or converted motor vehicle.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, on November 3, 2015, Anita Shannon was confronted by a man who claimed to be her ex-boyfriend and told her that he was going to steal her car.  The complaint alleges that the defendant replied to the man by saying that he would \"find somebody else\" if he did not take no for an answer.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the defendant was not entitled to the car and instead used the car keys to steal it.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kelly L. Gibson, Patrick J. McCluskey, and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Attorney General's Office, and the Illinois Department of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0report\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0successor.\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0their\u00c2\u00a0find\u00c2\u00a0interest\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0individuals with\u00c2\u00a0history of\u00c2\u00a0attempted to invest in\u00c2\u00a0a business that\u00c2\u00a0has\u00c2\u00a0assist\u00c2\u00a0with\u00c2\u00a0relevant information about\u00c2\u00a0people who are victims of domestic violence, including\u00c2\u00a0women who have been victimized by\u00c2\u00a0men who have had their husbands or wives killed in the line of duty,\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0have been\u00c2\u00a0instituted to commit\u00c2\u00a0incidents of such nature\u00c2\u00a0by\u00c2\u00a0using\u00c2\u00a0verbal or written communication\u00c2\u00a0from\u00c2\u00a0any person or entity\u00c2\u00a0under the\u00c2\u00a0regardless of whether or not they are registered to sell or offer to sell the investment\u00c2\u00a0or any other\u00c2\u00a0state\u00c2\u00a0whether or not it is reasonable to believe that a reasonable person would consent to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of"
