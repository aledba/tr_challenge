  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Indiana today announced criminal charges against a Franklin, Indiana man for his role in a 2017 carjacking and other criminal activity.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on May 14, 2017, Keith entered the garage of the nearby home of Clayton Dixon and his wife, Ella Dixon, and demanded to know why he had broken into the Dixons' home and taken their car, money, and guns. Keith allegedly told his wife that he wanted a divorce and that he had tried to rob her.  According to the complaint, Keith also claimed that he was intoxicated on methamphetamine when he gave his first statement to Detective Carter.  Keith also allegedly claimed that his wife had cooperated with law enforcement by speaking with them after he was arrested and sentenced to prison.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois today announced parallel criminal prosecutions against Keith.  On May 24, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Keith, and ordered Keith to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Keith consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  A hearing on May 25, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Indiana Department of Corrections in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221."
