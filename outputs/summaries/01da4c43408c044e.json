  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty on all counts of menacing.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, on September 1, 2006, a defendant was charged with 13 counts of aggravated murder and other noncapital crimes.  The complaint alleges that defendant had brandished a flashlight at his neighbor during an argument, then went inside his house and returned with a gun.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the defendant did not have the gun or the gun, and instead used a combination of verbal and written statements to convince the jury that he had committed a serious and serious felony.  In addition, the complaint alleged that defendant was liable for a civil injunctive action, for which he was ordered to pay a civil penalty, and for an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,038, and a civil monetary penalty of $100,000.    The SEC's investigation was conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oregon State Attorney General's Office, and the Oregon Bureau of Criminal Investigation."
