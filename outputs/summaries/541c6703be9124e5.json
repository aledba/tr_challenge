  "summary": "The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services today announced that it has obtained a court order halting the implementation of a 2020 census question.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Secretary of Commerce Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., issued an order on March 26, 2018 to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.  According to the complaint, the citizenship question is a sensitive question that affects the self-response rates of noncitizen and Latino households.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, based on the Census Bureau's own research, it is highly likely that the Citizenship Question will cause a significant decline in the number of people who respond to the census because of the question, resulting in a significant differential undercount of noncitizens and Latinos in the United States.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on May 2, 2017, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced that they would conduct a series of citizen-to-citizen follow-up surveys to determine the impact of the Citizenship question on the country's self-responders.  Among other things, the SEC alleges that the census question is sensitive and capricious, represented an abuse of discretion, and represented a threat to the accuracy and quality of the census.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the federal criminal case, Ross has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Separately, on May 9, 2018, the United Kingdom's Attorney General announced criminal charges against Ross in connection with the same matter.  On May 10, 2018 the UHS announced that the agency had obtained an emergency court order freezing Ross's assets and ordering the asset freeze and other emergency relief ordered by the court.  To learn more about this matter, see Press Release No. 17-20-19, May 24, 2018.
