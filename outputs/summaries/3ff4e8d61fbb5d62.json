  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on June 28, 2018, entered a final judgment in a civil injunctive action brought by a group of sex workers who are seeking to protect their clients from online solicitation.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, Eric Koszyk, a licensed massage therapist and co-founder of Soothing Spirit Massage, and Alex Andrews, a registered representative of Rate That Rescue, falsely claimed that they would protect victims of online solicitation by providing them with information about products and services that they commonly use.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the defendants had no such right of action, and that they had no right of association with any of the companies involved in this conduct.  In addition, as alleged in the complaint, Koszyk has alleged that he suffered constitutional and monetary injuries when Craigslist shut down its Therapeutic Services section shortly after the passage of FOSTA, thereby drying up his client base.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Andrews and Andrews consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $10,000.  Andrews also agreed to be enjoined from associating with any third party in violation of Section 230, and from participating in any offering of or sale of a product or service that constitutes a \"permanent or substantial threat of prosecution.\"  The court also ordered the defendants to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On June 29, 2019, the SEC filed a civil action in the United States District Court against Koszyk and Andrews, alleging that he violated Section 230 by engaging in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a federal statute.  As alleged, the complaint also alleges that Koszyk violated Section 1595, which provides for the right of a person to engage in a conduct that is inconsistent with the duties of a government agency, including that of a lawyer.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Matthew A. Goldstein of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Andrew Babbitt. \u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U."
