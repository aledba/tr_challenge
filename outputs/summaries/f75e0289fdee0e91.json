  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado today announced criminal charges against Quinten Martinez.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in August 2015, Martinez was sentenced to jail and probation under section 42-4-1307(7)(c)(I) for a third or subsequent DUI conviction. The court twice revoked his probation and resentenced him. Martinez has served 608 days in jail related to this offense, of which 458 stem from probation violations. According to the complaint, the court revoked Martinez's probation and sentenced him to 355 days of jail with a 365-day suspended sentence. The complaint further alleges that Martinez moved for a stay of execution to impose a one-year reservoir of potential jail time on the defendant. The SEC alleges that the court granted Martinez's request for a certiorari review, which was granted by the court on the basis of the court's order.  In a parallel action, on May 3, 2010, a federal district court in Denver issued an order suspending Martinez from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The order temporarily enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $600,000. Martinez agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 4, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Martinez, charging him with violations of the federal securities laws, and with violating Section 16-11-206(7) and (8) of that federal securities law. Martinez consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of these provisions, ordering him to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, and ordering him disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest. The final judgment also orders Martinez to pay civil penalties in the amount of $400,000, which is equal to the penalty imposed under the previous sentencing order. Martinez also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to a five-year officer-and-director bar. In addition, Martinez will be prohibited from serving any prison term other than one year.  As a result of the settlement with the SEC, Martinez has already served 355 days in prison. The Court granted Martinez a temporary restraining order prohibiting him from associating with any third-time DUI offender. The Final Judgment also prohibits Martinez from participating"
