  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in favor of the heirs of several Jewish art dealers who were among the first to be charged by the Nazis with defrauding the Jewish community in Germany.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Berlin, Germany, in 1929, three art dealers formed a \"consortium\" and purchased a collection of medieval art called the Welfenschatz. The complaint alleges that, as a result of the Nazi takeover of power in Germany, the Jewish communities were left with virtually no means of making a living.  The complaint also alleges that the Jewish artists were disproportionately targeted by the Nazi occupiers, and that, in some instances, the art dealers were forced to sell their art to the occupiers as part of an effort to \"drive[i] Jewish people out of their ability to make a living.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the three Jewish artists.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Germany violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of its Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Germany consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. The court also granted the heirs the right to apply for a temporary restraining order, which is subject to court approval. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Mr. Bort and Mr. Werner, and is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case has been supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Austrian Ministry of Justice in this matter."
