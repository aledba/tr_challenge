  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Ohio today announced criminal charges against two Ohio residents for their roles in a scheme to illegally dredge the East Branch Chagrin River.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, Richard M. Osborne and his company, Osborne Co., Ltd., operated a track hoe in the middle of the river in violation of the federal water pollution control laws.  The complaint alleges that Mr. Osborne instructed Mr. Franz to use the dredged material to create a riparian buffer along the river bank.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the material was improperly dredged from the riverbed and deposited on private property.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced that it has obtained a court order to freeze the assets of Osborne Co. and related entities.  On August 15, 2014, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to pay $404,240.00 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael DeWine and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the Miami Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by John R. Rymas. \u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources in this matter."
