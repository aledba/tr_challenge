  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against Robert Carr, a convicted felon who was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for a series of felony charges, including criminal confinement while armed with a deadly weapon, a felony; battery resulting in serious bodily injury, a Level 5 felony; and escape from prison with intent to commit a felony.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Indianapolis, Carr, who was on house arrest at the time of the alleged conduct, made several phone calls to S.G., including one in which Carr allegedly told her that he was going to give her some of the money he had received from his aunt. Carr allegedly also allegedly told his aunt that he would give her the use of a car, cash, and a place to stay if she wanted to participate in the trial. The complaint further alleges that Carr's aunt, who also lives in the home, overheard Carr making the calls. The court found that Carr violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Carr to pay a civil penalty of $20,000. Carr agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson, John Rymas, and Justin J. Burt of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
