  "summary": "The Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has obtained a final judgment against a Pennsylvania liquor license violator who improperly sought to conceal his personal address and residency from the state licensing agency.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Pennsylvania, alleges that, on August 1, 2017, the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Resources (DOH) issued an order requiring the disclosure of the names, addresses, and residency of all employees of Pennsylvania licensed liquor licenses and/or permits submitted to the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board pursuant to Section 708(b)(17)(ii) of the Pennsylvania Licensing Act of 1940.  According to the complaint, the PLCB improperly permitted Requester to modify his original request on appeal to include home addresses and length of residency, even though the request did not require this information.

On August 2, 2018, the Court granted the request for partial redactions of all applicants' addresses and lengths of residency and granted the agency's motion for a final determination on whether to grant or revoke the exemption.  As set forth in the order, the final determination requires that the agency determine whether to revoke or revoke a license or permit based on the reasonable reasonable expectation that a reasonable person should have access to all of the information requested by the applicants.  Specifically, the order requires the agency to provide the names and addresses of all license holders and those with a pecuniary interest in the conduct of business on licensed premises.   The court also granted the application for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the issuance of any liquor license without"
