  "summary": "The Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting the suspension of a motor vehicle operator's license for forty-five days.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut, alleges that Nicholas Adams, a resident of New Britain, Connecticut, was arrested on May 14, 2016 and ordered to submit to field sobriety tests. According to the complaint, the officer observed that the defendant was virtually out of control at the time he was arrested, had just driven his vehicle into a stationary object, and was unable to complete the test. The complaint further alleges that after the test was performed, the defendant refused to submit a urine sample. The court found that the complaint was reasonable based on the facts presented to the officer, and that the officer had probable cause to arrest the defendant for operating under the influence of drugs. The SEC also found that, contrary to the SEC's findings, Armstrong did not fail to submit an adequate urine test. In addition, the complaint alleges that Armstrong failed to provide any corroborating evidence to support the finding that he had failed to comply with the court order suspending him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any motor vehicle, and, in a parallel action, ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC filed an emergency action against Adams, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 14b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Adams' violations of the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"). The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being handled by Jonathan Ross Sills, Assistant Attorney General, and Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Connecticut State Attorney General's Office, the Department of Justice, and the Connecticut Office of Insurance Regulation."
