  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against Delivery Express, Inc., a courier service company, and its founder, David Hamilton, in a parallel action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, alleges that, in 1996, the Department of Labor and Industries (DLEI) improperly classified trucks as \"workers\" under Section 51.08.180 of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, in 2010, DEI obtained a Washington Utilities & Transportation Commission (WUTC) intrastate common carrier permit, purchased vehicles, and hired drivers for whom it paid workers\u2019 compensation premiums.  In 2011, the DLEI issued an order requiring all trucks to be leased to a common carrier for the purpose of delivering packages to DEI customers, and requiring all drivers to maintain adequate records under RCW 51.12.020.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Board\u2019s order, Delivery Express agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $127,500, a $50,000 civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval."
