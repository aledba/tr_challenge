  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a former Algonquin police officer who was found guilty of driving over the posted speed limit.  According to the court's order, on September 27, 2016, Josh Latina was on patrol in the middle lane of southbound Randall Road when he saw a silver car drive through the intersection at a high rate of speed.  Latina allegedly used two tuning forks to test the radar device, set for different speeds, and did so again after the stop.  The court also found that Latina had failed to provide sufficient foundation for the evidence that the radar and speedometer had been tested and certified as accurate.  As alleged in the complaint, Latina's testimony about the radar reading and his personal observation of defendant's driving was not sufficient to convince the court that he had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $311, and imposes a $1,000 officer-and-director bar against Latina.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against him.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Transportation, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Homeland Security, the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations Division, the Missouri Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General, the FBI's Retail Strategy Task Force, the State Department of Health and Human Services Criminal Investigation Division, as well as the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations Division of Criminal Investigations."
