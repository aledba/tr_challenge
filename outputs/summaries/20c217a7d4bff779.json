  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Pfizer, Inc., a pharmaceutical company, in a multi-pronged litigation action brought by more than three thousand women alleging that their use of Lipitor caused them to develop diabetes.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, the defendants raised the issue of whether or not to add expert testimony to the litigation.  The complaint alleges that Dr. Nicholas J. Jewell, a registered representative of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, reviewed data from several clinical trials involving Lipitor and concluded that it was unlikely that the drug caused diabetes. The complaint further alleges that, based on his own testimony, Dr.Jewell concluded that Lipitor led to a statistically significant increase in the risk of diabetes among patients who took the drug.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court also ruled that the defendants had failed to adequately consider the evidence presented in the trial.  In its judgment, which was entered on a temporary basis, the Court found that, as a result of the litigation, all of the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that, in the alternative, Judge Daubert could impose a permanent injunction and order the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval, to the appointment of a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, and to the issuance of an order requiring the receiver to provide timely and accurate information about the receiver's progress. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Werner. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice."
