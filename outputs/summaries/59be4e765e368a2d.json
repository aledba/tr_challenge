  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a Miami-based company and its former CEO for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that, shortly after they purchased and operated an entertainment complex located in Miami Beach, the Miami-Dade County Board of Commissioners improperly delayed issuing building permits, improperly delayed permitting reviews, and attempted to repeal an existing special exemption.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that the defendants violated the federal securities laws by failing to show cause of action for violations of substantive due process.  In its judgment, the court found that defendants had a legitimate right to a fair and reasonable due process, and that they had a constitutionally protected right to engage in a chosen trade or profession.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.   The judgment also orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $1,000,000 and a $500,000 each, respectively, to be determined by the court at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Miami Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Miami Office of Financial Regulation."
