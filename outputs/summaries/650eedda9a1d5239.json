  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Albany, alleges that defendant Louis Sanfilippo invented the \"8,318,813\" Patent, which relates to methods for the treatment of Binge Eating Disorder with the drug lisdexamfetamine dimesylate.  According to the complaint, in connection with the filing of the IPR, the defendants sought a six-figure penalty based on the number of hours reasonably expended by counsel on the litigation.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to disclose to the court that they were unable to pay the $133,803.75 lodestar amount due to the defendants.  For example, in one case, the court found that a five-figure award is not sufficient to offset the costs and fees owed to each defendant.  Additionally, in another case, in which the court granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered them to pay a $15,000 civil penalty, the Court found that the Defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000 each.  On May 21, 2019, the Honorable Judge Richard G. Torres of the United States District Court in the District of South Carolina granted the Defendants' request for an asset freeze and ordered the payment of a $1.5 million civil penalty.  Separately, on May 24, 2018, Judge Torres issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  Judge Torres also ordered the Defendants to pay disgorgement of $3,078.75 plus prejudgment interests of $2,835.40 and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Last week, the SEC filed an emergency action against the defendants, charging them with violations of the anti-fraud provision of Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 15a-14 and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and seeking a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 20(b).  The court also issued a subpoena for the defendants"
