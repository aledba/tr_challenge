  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida yesterday entered a final judgment against a Florida-based chiropractor and two others for their roles in a 2014 automobile accident.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on July 9, 2014, Ninibeth Meyers was driving down Park Boulevard in Seminole, Florida when she was hit by a car that had suddenly changed lanes leaving her without room to stop.  According to the complaint, Ms. Meyers' car then hit the car in front of her, causing her to lose control of the car.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Meyers and her husband, Nicholas Bozick, claimed that the accident caused Ms. Shontz's injuries and that she was liable for the injuries.  In fact, the complaint alleges, the Meyerses' claims were based on false testimony from a single witness, who was not present at the time of the accident and did not testify at the trial.   The complaint further alleges that the trial court did not consider the totality of the evidence presented to the jury, and instead relied solely on the testimony of one of the witnesses, who claimed to have suffered a \"classical whiplash injury\" when, in fact, she had suffered a severe spinal cord injury and a sprain or tear of her left leg.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,078 in prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Eric R. Birkenheier and Glenn S. Gordon in the Miami Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, the Florida Department of Insurance, and the Florida State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
