  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a New York City school principal for his role in a teacher evaluation fraud.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that John McSorley, a tenured English teacher at Mott Haven School in New York, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he failed to comply with required review procedures.  According to the complaint, as a result of his failure to observe and observe petitioner's class, he received an \"ineffective\" \u201cMeasure of Teacher Practice\u201d (MOSL) score, which is based on the recommendation of a school evaluation officer, and an \"effective\u201d \"Measure of Student Learning\" score.  In addition, the complaint alleges that as the school's assistant principal observed petitioner during the 2013/2014 school year, he did not give him a copy of the MOSL when he should have, and did not ensure that he received a copy after the fact.

For example, the Commission found that, in 2013 and 2014, the school and its assistant principal had failed to adequately assess the effectiveness of the teacher evaluation process, including whether petitioner was competent to provide services to the students assigned to him, whether he was capable of providing effective teaching, and whether he had demonstrated a pattern of ineffective teaching or performance that was consistent with the Department's determination that he had not shown any extraordinary circumstances. The Commission also found that the school violated Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 and Rule 15c2-2 thereunder.
