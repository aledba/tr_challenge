  "summary": "On May 21, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Verizon Wireless employee Bianca Cunningham, finding that the company violated Section 8(a)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Brooklyn, alleges that Cunningham, a long-time employee of Verizon, was terminated for lying during an investigation.  According to the complaint, Cunningham told the company that she had received a series of text messages from a supervisor who had asked her to leave the company, and that the supervisor had told her not to tell her to go home.  Cunningham also allegedly told her supervisor that she would call someone to get advice on whether she could go or not.   The complaint further alleges that, in reality, Cunningham had not lied during the investigation and had not engaged in any conduct that would have resulted in her termination.  In a parallel action, the SEC today announced that it had terminated Cunningham for lying to the company.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Cunningham agreed to be permanently barred from the company\u2019s business practices and to be placed on paid leave until the company could complete an unrelated investigation and deal with both matters in a single meeting.  On May 22, Cunningham answered another phone call from a junior supervisor who was the subject of the investigation, telling her that she was going to clock back in to work.  She did not tell her supervisor, however, that the conversation with Cunningham had taken place over the phone, and she had not told her manager.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, the company had not given Cunningham permission to leave, despite repeated reminders to her to do so, and Cunningham had told Cunningham that he had given her permission. \u00c2\u00a0 The SEC complaint charges Cunningham with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 8 of the Exchange Act, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Additionally, the complaint charges Eshareturi with aiding and abetting Cunningham's violations of Section 10(b) of Exchange Act and Rule 12b2-1 thereunder, and charges her with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act and Exchange Act Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 13a-14 thereunder and with violating Exchange Act Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and Rules 12b-20, 13d-1, and 14d-3 thereunder in violation of Section 9(a).    In its order to determine whether to permanently bar Cunningham from serving as an officer or director of a public company, the court"
