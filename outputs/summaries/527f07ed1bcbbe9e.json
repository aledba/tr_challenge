  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Costa Victoria Healthcare, LLC and its owner, David Jorgenson, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Costa Victoria and its licensed facility administrator, David Worsham, failed to adequately supervise Cohoon while he was being treated at Victoria Center.  According to the complaint, the staff at the nursing center were not properly trained in the subject matter, and the staff were not adequately trained.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the staff did not adequately monitor Cohoon, despite repeated requests from the hospital staff to do so.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Costa Victoria failed to provide Cohoon with sufficient food and water and to provide him with adequate rest.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $320,000, prejudgment interest of $1,315,495, and a civil penalty of $350,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Office of Inspector General, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the California Department of Insurance, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and FINRA."
