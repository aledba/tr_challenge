  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Robert Ray, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 108 years in prison for his roles in three separate criminal cases.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from July 4 through August 4, 2004, Ray was charged with first-degree murder and accessory to murder in connection with the shooting death of Gregory Vann and attempted murder for trying to shoot Jeremy Green.  According to the complaint, in the days following the shooting, Ray allegedly made a series of aggressive statements to a crowd of people, including one in which he allegedly threatened to \"kill everyone.\"  The complaint further alleges that the defendant repeatedly threatened to kill everyone present at the event, including himself and his close friend, and that he had a nine-millimeter semiautomatic handgun in his waistband when he confronted the defendant about his aggressive behavior, head-butted him in the face, and heard him, at several points during the confrontation, threaten to kill everybody.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Ray consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Ray arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On August 5, 2017, the Honorable Judge Richard J. Krutsinger of the New York District Court entered a default judgment against Ray, ordering him to be enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering a conduct-based injunction, and imposing a $1,000,000 civil penalty.   The court also ordered Ray to pay a $2,500,000 penalty, which is equal to the amount of his prison time, and ordered that he be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the securities of any broker, dealer, municipal, or municipal securities dealer.  Additionally, the court ordered that Ray be restrained from making any statements or making any offer to sell any securities to the public in the interest of obtaining an injunction against future violations.  As a result of the court's order, the jury was not permitted to view the videotape of the defendant during deliberations, despite repeated requests by the defendant.  For further information, see People v. People, 2018 CO 72, 441, 448 (Colo. 2001).  The Honorable"
