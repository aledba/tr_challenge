  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against a Bel Air, Maryland-based company and its Vice President of Solar Energy for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Harford County, Maryland, Jonathan and Megan Blood purchased a single-family home in Bel Air in April 2015. The complaint alleges that when they signed the contract to install a solar collection system on their home, they mistakenly believed that SolarGaines would take responsibility for getting approval from their homeowners' association to install their system. In fact, the complaint alleges, as alleged in the complaint, the Association's order places an unreasonable limitation on the number of solar panels that can be removed from the front roof of a home.  The complaint also alleges that the Association improperly withheld its consent to the removal of the panels.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Maryland today announced criminal charges against the Bloods.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 2-119 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, and 14a-14 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the destruction of any evidence that may have been obtained in connection with the alleged violations.  On May 4, 2020, the court entered a judgment ordering the defendants to comply with the court's order, ordering them to remove the panels from their front roofs, and requiring them to provide a reason for denying their initial application for approval of the system.   The court granted the defendants' request for a preliminary injunction, ordered the installation of a new roof, and issued an order requiring that the defendants remove the solar panels from the back roof of their home. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Felicity Barringer. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Maryland Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency."
