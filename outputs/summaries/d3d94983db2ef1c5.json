  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of two felony counts of resisting an officer with force or violence in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that on June 6, 2016, Sgt. Joshua Stanford, a Deridder Police Department officer, received a phone call from an officer who asked whether he wanted to be arrested and arrested. The officer replied that he did not have reasonable grounds to believe that he was committing a felony and that he should be sentenced as a habitual offender subject to enhanced sentencing. The complaint further alleges that the officer confronted the officer and confronted the defendant, who refused to comply with the officer's repeated requests for an arrest. The court ultimately found that the defendant had not waived the mandatory twenty-four hour sentencing delay required by the federal securities laws, and that the judge did not err in applying the recently amended version of the Habitual Offender Law to the defendant. The SEC also found that, in a parallel action, the court improperly issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendant to surrender his passport.  In a parallel administrative proceeding, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Stanford. The case was investigated by the Office of the United States Attorney's Assistant Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations, and the case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Amy C. McKinley. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Inspector General, the Louisiana Department of Criminal Justice, the Department of State's Office of Public Safety, the Criminal Division's Criminal Justice Division, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations Unit, the Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit and the Louisiana Office of Financial Regulation."
