  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a temporary restraining order against a defendant in a case brought by the United States Department of State alleging that he was unfairly treated and unlawfully deprived of his 2015 visa.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Yung-Kai Lu was the lucky winner of the Diversity Visa (DV) program for the 2015 fiscal year, and that the delays in visa processing were the result of internal technical difficulties.  According to the complaint, Lu had previously resided in the country and had applied for a visa since 2002.  In 2015, Lu claimed that he had been selected out of a pool of applicants for a Diversity Visa, but was denied a visa because of \"technical\" issues and \"computer system glitches.\"  The complaint further alleges that Lu had been interviewed by the State Department's Office of Citizenship and Immigration Services (DOIS) in October 2015, and was informed that the DV program for fiscal year 2015 is closed, and winning entries from that year are no longer eligible for processing.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Lu consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $60,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  On May 24, 2017, the court granted a preliminary injunction against Lu and ordered him to comply with the court's order, which requires him to show cause and effect, including that he has complied with the order, that the court has jurisdiction to grant relief under Rule 12(b)(1) and that it has the right to revoke the visa of a person who has not yet submitted an application for a DV visa for the prior fiscal year for which he was selected.  Lu has also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or purchase of any security-related security-based security measure, including an officer-and-director bar, as well as a five-year bar.  To settle the case, Lu will be required to provide a copy of his visa application to the Department of Homeland Security, which will be reviewed by the court upon motion by the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1717.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in the U."
