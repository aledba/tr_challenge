  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found liable for failing to comply with a court order to terminate the parental rights of two minor children.  The court also found that Father failed to provide adequate housing for the children because he failed to complete the case plan.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Idaho on March 16, 2018, Father was incarcerated for over 23 months for drug use and neglect related to the children's placement in the Department of Health and Welfare's custody.  As alleged in the order, the court terminated Father's parental rights in March 2016 after finding that he had failed to fulfill a case plan and failed to adequately support the children financially.  Father also failed to participate in drug testing, attend parenting classes, and participate in parenting classes.  In a separate action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Father.
