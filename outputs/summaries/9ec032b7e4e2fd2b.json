  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment in favor of the company and its principal and sole member in a workers' compensation case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manchester, Connecticut, alleges that Fresh Start General Remodeling & Contracting, LLC (Fresh Start) and Fresh Start Realty, LLC (\"Fresh Start\"), hired the claimant to assist him in moving from his house in Manchester to a new house in Bolton, Bolton, Connecticut. The complaint alleges that the claimant failed to prove that he was an employee of the respondent and entitled to benefits under the employer-employee relationship, and failed to provide sufficient due process to hold him personally liable for the claimant's injuries. According to the complaint, the complaint also alleges that, contrary to the Commission's finding, Fresh Start was not liable as an employee under the act because it did not have reasonable due process sufficient to hold the respondent personally liable as the employer. Fresh Start also failed to submit a brief, which the complaint alleges was an error in its determination of whether the claimant was a \"regular\" employee. The Commission's final judgment against Fresh Start, which was entered yesterday, permanently enjoins Fresh Start from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Fresh Start to pay a civil penalty of $8,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Western District of New York today announced criminal charges against the claimant. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an order freezing the assets of Fresh Start. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendant. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The matter is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Secretary of State's Office."
