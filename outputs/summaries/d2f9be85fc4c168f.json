  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona today entered a final judgment against Jessica M. Mukavetz, a mitigation specialist who worked for the Maricopa County Office of the Legal Defender, for her husband's death.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, alleges that, having gained custody of Rene Durgin, a member of the Mexican Mafia who was awaiting trial on several felony charges, that she aided and abetted Durgin's and Hoover's violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that, in violation of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, she assisted Durgin and Hoover carry out their business.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the Arizona Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has filed an emergency action to freeze the assets of the Arizona Department of Justice and the Arizona Attorney General's Office in connection with a related criminal case involving Durgin.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans granted the court's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the destruction of any evidence or evidence that may be relevant to the investigation.   The court's order also temporarily halted the issuance of an order suspending the asset freeze and imposing a civil penalty of $150,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David J. Gipson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Quiroz and Ms. Stair."
