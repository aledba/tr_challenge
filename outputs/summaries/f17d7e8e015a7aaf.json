  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against New York State's Attorney General and several medical providers for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that the state's assisted-suicide statutes violate the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, from at least 1984 through at least 2014, the state passed a law that prohibited physician-assisted suicide.  In addition, the complaint alleges that New York's assisted suicide statutes prohibit physicians from providing or administering medication to terminally ill patients.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, the law does not impose a \"reasonable basis\" for a state's prohibition on assisted suicide, and instead requires that a reasonable basis be established to determine whether an individual has a legitimate right to self-determination and to control the course of their medical treatment.  For example, the SEC previously ruled that a surgeon who performed an operation without the patient's consent committed an assault and, in a parallel action, a criminal defendant was found liable for aiding and abetting the defendant's violation of Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The complaint also alleges that a physician who provides assisted suicide is not liable as a person for any reasonable purpose under the federal law.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of up to $100,000.  Finally, the court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from participating in assisted suicide activities, and issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the receiver's receivership.  On May 17, 2016, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of California granted the relief sought by the SEC in its Complaint. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Department of Health, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in the Division of Health and Human Services in this matter."
