  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against Navistar, Inc. and its former auditor, Douglas Pinney, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that Navistar misrepresented to the BTA that it had a 100 percent valuation allowance when, in fact, it had no valuation allowance at all.  According to the complaint, Navistar also misrepresented that the valuation allowance was based on raw, non-GAAP financial statements, and that the restated financials for the years ended October 31, 2003 and 2004 were not GAAP compliant.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, which was filed in the United States District Court in the District of Columbia on April 4, 2015, the Commission accepted Navistar's motion for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting and reporting suspension.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Pinney and Savage, who were also named as relief defendants in the complaint.  Navistar and Pinney consented to the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the Commission. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans granted Navistar &rsqua;s request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary asset freeze.  An SEC order appointing a receiver for Navistar was instituted on May 24, 2019.  A hearing on June 5, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5751.53 (A)(9) and (B).  The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Mr. Rawlings. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Ohio Attorney General's Office in this matter."
