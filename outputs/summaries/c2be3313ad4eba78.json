  "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a Massachusetts-based company and its founder for misappropriating trade secrets related to handheld x-ray backscatter imaging devices.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newton, Massachusetts, alleges that Viken Technologies Inc. and its CEO, Paul Bradshaw, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Bradshaw was the company's Director of Engineering when Viken hired him in 2013.  Viken alleges that Bradshaw used his personal Dropbox account to access confidential Viken documents and to develop and market a competing product using that information.  In addition, Viken allegedly used Bradshaw's Dropbox account for research and development purposes and Bradshaw allegedly used it to acquire and market the prototype device Viken developed.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule\u00c2\u00a05(b) thereunder, and Section 10(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 12a-1, 12b2-2, and 13a-13 thereunder and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers\").  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.    In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against Bradshaw. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0instant search tool\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Viken in April, 2019, charging Bradshaw with violating Sections 5, 5, and (a)\u00a0\u00a7 1030(a)(4).  In its complaint, the Commission also charged Viken's former Chief Technology Officer, Joseph Callerame, with aiding and abetting the violations of Sections 5 and 5 of the Exchange Act and Rules 5a-14 and 16a-17.
