  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against Michael Ross, Jr., who was convicted of premeditated first-degree murder and, in the alternative, felony manslaughter.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that, on November 9, 2015, Ross, then a certified nursing assistant at the Kansas City Regional Office, made two phone calls to his mother, telling her that G.H. had fallen from a standing position and hit her head on a door.  According to the complaint, Ross allegedly told his mother that he had just seen her fall and that she had been hit in the head by a TV.  He also allegedly told her that he was the only adult in the room when she fell and that he \"saw her crying.\"  The complaint alleges that Ross' mother replied that she did not believe his version of events, and instead simply told him that she was holding her ribs.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Ross.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Ross consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Ross also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  On November 13, 2016, the court granted Ross' motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered him to be enjoined from further violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  As part of the settlement, Ross agreed to a five-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock, and to be restrained from associating with any broker dealer, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  To settle the case, Ross will be required to show that he has a history of self-dealing with the issues raised in the complaint.  For further information, see State v. Davis, 306 Kan. 704, 704 P.3d 817 (2017).  The case was supervised by Eric Glendinning, Chief of the Kansas Department of Health and Human Services, and Timothy Gorrill, Regional Director of the Department of Justice's Office of Criminal Investigations."
