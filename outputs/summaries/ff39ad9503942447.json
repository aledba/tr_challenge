  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against the defendant in a wrongful termination case.  The court entered a temporary restraining order on September 21, 2018, freezing the defendant's assets and ordering the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $1.2 million.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, Texas, Matthew L. Anders filed a brief in September 2018 stating that, in fifteen cases dating back to 2014, this court did not strike Anders briefs in which the substantive portions were identical, word for word, to the brief filed in this case. The complaint further alleges that, after a conscientious examination of the record, counsel concluded that an appeal is wholly frivolous because the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to satisfy the court's findings. The court also found that Anders' brief satisfies the uniform Anders briefing requirements, which apply in criminal and juvenile appeals and to termination appeals. The SEC's order, which enjoins defendants from violating these requirements, requires defendants to file a pro se brief that includes a summary of the evidence at trial, a discussion of and citations to Anders v. California and its progeny, and an \"Argument\" section describing why counsel has concluded the appeal is frivolous. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Anders has conscientiously reviewed the record and concluded that he has concluded that there are no non-frivolous issues for an appeal. The judgment also prohibits defendants from acting as unregistered broker-dealers in terminating a parent's right to counsel.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Anders for his role in this matter. The case was investigated by the Texas Office of Advocacy, which issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage parents to check the background of anyone filing an emergency action by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Advocacy.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert on Investor.gov to encourage investors to consider investing in a fund that provides emergency relief to victims of domestic violence and other emergency relief.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly and easily identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office."
