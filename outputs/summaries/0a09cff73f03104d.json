  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment in favor of Marion County, Indiana, against the Board of County Commissioners for its failure to approve an early-in-person absentee ballot initiative.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that the Board violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the Board's failure to act on the Commission's recommendation resulted in a significant reduction in the number of early-voting days in Marion County.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in 2008 and 2009, the Commission failed to approve a satellite office for Marion County because it did not have sufficient staff or funding.  As alleged in the Commission&rsquo;s complaint, this was the first time that the Commission had failed to implement early-bird voting in the county since 1964.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Complaint, the Court agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from future violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments, and orders the Commission to conduct an independent examination of its policies and procedures to determine whether the Commission violated the federal securities laws. The Commission also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 civil penalty.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the U. S. District Judge's Office in Indianapolis issued a temporary restraining order against the Commission and ordered it to issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the issuance and operation of the new satellite offices. The order also ordered the Commission not to impose any additional administrative or financial burden on Marion County residents, including those who are registered to vote, and to pay an $8,500 civil penalty to be determined by the court upon motion by the Commission.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Jennifer C. Thompson and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Thompson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Indiana Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Attorney's Office for the Central and Southern Districts of Indiana. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov."
