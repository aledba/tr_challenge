  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of Deena Chambers, a Nebraska resident who died in January 2018.  The court found that Kent failed to prove the decedent stood in the acknowledged relation of a parent with an acknowledged relation to a parent.  According to the court's order, filed on August 7, 2018, in Estate of Malloy, Nebraska, Kent, as personal representative, filed an inventory for Deena's estate in the county court for the purpose of determining whether a parent-child relationship existed between Deena and Anthony.  In the inventory, Kent allegedly signed an affidavit stating that he was like a child to Anthony and that he had a close and caring relationship with Deena.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the document did not show that Anthony was a person to whom Deena was a \"like a child\" and that his relationship with Anthony was not out of the ordinary for family members in a rural society.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, Kent consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 77-2004 of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. The court also ordered him to sign a copy of the final judgment, which is subject to court approval.  On August 13, 2019, the court issued an order requiring a hearing on Deena\u2019s estate on her behalf, ordering Kent to submit an amended will that included language that acknowledged Anthony as a parent, and requiring him to waive his duty to represent the county and the state of Nebraska in making a determination of inheritance tax.   The order also requires Kent to sign an inheritance tax worksheet that includes the relevant facts concerning the relationship between Anthony and Deena, including that Anthony fit the category of \"Like a Child\" to Deena in the will and that Deena fit the description of a \"Class I\" to Anthony in the final will and testament.  Additionally, the order requires that the county attorney sign the amended worksheet and waive notice of the judgment.
