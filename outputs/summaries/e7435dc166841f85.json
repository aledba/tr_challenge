  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against the Jim Hutton Foundation for its alleged violations of the federal water laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Yuma County, Colorado, alleges that, in 1942, the General Assembly passed the Colorado Ground Water Management Act, which provided for the right to develop Colorado\u2019s groundwater resources.  According to the complaint, in 2010, the Colorado Legislature passed a water-law amendment that required the Commission to determine whether the water at issue is in fact designated groundwater.  In 2011, the Commission ruled that the water was not designated groundwater, and that the Commission had jurisdiction over matters not involving designated groundwater in 2010.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the amendment deprived surface-water users of the ability to petition the Commission for relief when the Commission determined that groundwater was not being used.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the Foundation has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to conduct a conduct-based examination of the water in its jurisdiction.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 10-52 (January 17, 2017).  The Commission's Order to Restart Rule No. 12(b)(1) and Rule 12b-5 thereunder, and the Division of Water Resources order to restate the Commission's findings in a related action filed in the federal district court for the Northern High Plains Basin. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's order also requires the Foundation to prove to the Commission that it has jurisdiction over any well that is not using designated groundwater and that such injury to those rights is caused by the pumping of then-designated ground water.\u00c2\u00a0 The Commission has not yet determined whether the well is designated groundwater; the court has not made a determination as to whether the wells are in fact being used designated groundwater yet.  It also has not issued any final judgments ordering it to restart its claims in the district court.  To resolve the SEC\u2019S case, the court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the Commission. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Denver Field Office, and Colorado State Water Resources."
