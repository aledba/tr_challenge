  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the New York City Police Department and New York State Department of Public Safety in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that the NYPD violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to disclose material non-public information about the officers involved in the September 6, 2017 fatal shooting of Mr. Richards.  According to the complaint, the NYPD also failed to disclose to the public that the officers were receiving medical treatment at the time of the shooting.  In addition, the complaint alleges that NYPD did not disclose the officers' actions after the shooting, despite repeated requests by the family to do so.  Further, the SEC alleges that, in response to the family's requests, NYPD waived the exemption at the administrative stage and instead raised it at the final stage.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On November 17, 2017, the court granted a request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against the defendants and ordered them to return the allegedly unredacted video and audio footage to the court for a hearing scheduled for January 26, 2019.  To learn more about the BWC pilot program, see Press Release Release No. 5, 849, 965, (January 24, 2019).  The complaint also seeks a court order requiring the NYPD to comply with the court's order by providing a copy of the FOIL request to the SEC.  For further information, see Matter of Beyah v. New York Police Department, 355 N.Y.2d 1049, 1050, 875 N.E.S.-2d 715, and Matter of Dobranski v. City of Albany, 206 A.D.3d 736, 737, 865, 895 N.YE.S-2d 865.  A hearing on January 25, 2019, is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter.   The case is being handled by Jennifer C. Barry and Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment."
