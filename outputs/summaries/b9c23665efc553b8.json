  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was sentenced to life without parole without the possibility of parole.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that, in 2008, a trial court in North Carolina found that a juvenile offender with a history of first-degree murder could be rehabilitated with the assistance of a trial judge.  According to the complaint, however, the court's finding that the juvenile offender was unlikely to rehabilitate as a result of his prior criminal conviction was speculative.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for North Carolina announced criminal charges against the defendant.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant was among the rarest of juvenile offenders for whom rehabilitation is impossible, and the trial court found that he was eligible for a sentence of life in prison without parole when, in fact, he was not eligible for parole at the time of the shooting.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint or otherwise, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The court also granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the imposition of a life sentence without parole for juveniles, and ordered the sentencing of the defendant to be determined by a court-by-judgment order.  To learn more about mandatory minimum sentencing for juvenile offenders, see Litigation Release No. 567 (2014).  The Complaint also alleges that the Court improperly held that mandatory minimum sentences for juveniles violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert C. McCluskey of the U.N. Circuit Court of Appeals in Charlotte issued an order imposing a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the sentencing authority to determine, as a matter of law, whether a defendant qualifies as an individual within the class of offenders who are irreparably corrupt, whether he would benefit from rehabilitation in confinement, and whether the judge should impose a mandatory minimum sentence.   The Court's order also prohibits the issuance of any civil injunctions or orders against further violation of the securities laws and orders the court to consider the merits of each defendant's case."
