  "summary": "On January 17, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Jan Rath, a citizen of the Czech Republic, ordering her to pay $89,490.26 in attorney's fees, $5421.00 in expenses, and $10,849.76 in fees.  The court found that Rath failed to establish that a reasonable attorney's fee award would be clearly inappropriate.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in New York, Rath violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its judgment, the court held that Rath violated Section 9003 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") and Rules 9003-8 thereunder, and that the court had the duty to award reasonable fees to a successful petitioner.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Rath consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, imposes a $75,000 civil penalty, and requires her to repay the amount of her ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and provides for an officer-and-director bar.  On January 20, 2020, the United States District Court entered a default judgment against Rath, finding that she violated the charged provision, ordering Rath to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $73,219.50 in attorney fees and expenses, for a total amount of $89.490.\u00c2\u00a0 The court also ordered Rath to reimburse the costs of providing legal representation for the child.    The SEC's complaint charges Rath with violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgements of $49,500, and a civil penalties of $90,000.  It also seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 17(a)(1) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against further violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(c)(3)(B).  The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's New York Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Florida Department of Justice in this matter."
