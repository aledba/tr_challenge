  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against Logan University and its Dean of Students in a civil action brought by two former students alleging that Logan failed to protect them against stalking and sexual harassment by a fellow student.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Morgan Katelin Pearson and Kirsten Elizabeth Kirkpatrick met with Sandra Periello, Logan\u2019s Associate Dean of Student Affairs, on December 8, 2015, to discuss their alleged misconduct. The complaint alleges that Pearson complained that FS had followed her inappropriately at a school event and had stopped to watch as a female classmate measured her hip bone at the library.  The complaint further alleges that after Pearson complained about FS, she was told that she could not go into the library during the duration of the investigation because she was afraid of being harassed by FS.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Education today announced that it has issued a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the books and records and records provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Pearson and Kirkpatrick have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of these provisions, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by James Madison University's Office of Compliance and Assurance, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Kirkpatrick. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
