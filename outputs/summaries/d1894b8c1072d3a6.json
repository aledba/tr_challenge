  "summary": "On January 11, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama entered a final judgment ordering Christopher E. Rose to pay a $45,000 attorney fee to represent him in connection with claims he was pursuing against corporate defendants pertaining to gasoline that had leaked from underground fuel-storage tanks into the soil on his property.  The court found that Rose was entitled to a reasonable attorney fee based on the reasonable value of services rendered.  According to the court's order, Rose signed a contingent fee agreement in which he agreed to pay the attorneys 45% \"solely from the proceeds\" of the net amount recovered, \"whether by settlement, trial, or otherwise.\"  Rose also agreed to have another attorney represent him on appeal.  On January 30, 2015, the trial court entered a summary judgment enforcing the first settlement agreement for $'100,000.  In its judgment, Rose agreed to settle the matter for $\u2002125,000, which represents a portion of the settlement proceeds owed to the attorneys.  After the settlement was reached, Rose and the attorneys filed an attorney's lien with the court, which was followed by an order to withdraw from their representation of Rose.  As alleged in the complaint, Rose was not entitled to compensation for services rendered before the attorneys' discharge on the basis of the fee agreement.  Instead, the court awarded the attorneys a fee of $43,464.50 based on their efforts to obtain payment for the services they had rendered to Rose before Rose discharged them.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, Rose has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay an attorney fee equal to the amount of his settlement with the corporate defendants.  Rose has also agreed not to participate in the litigation against him, to the appointment of a new attorney, and to the payment of a penalty equal to his disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest.  Additionally, the judgment also ordered that Rose pay a civil penalty of $'45,500.00, which is approximately $'20,000 less than the attorney fee he received in the second settlement agreement, and that he will be barred from serving as an attorney under the federal securities laws.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley of the Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Ms. Mazzone."
