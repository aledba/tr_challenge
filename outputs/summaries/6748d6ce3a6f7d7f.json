  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment in favor of a motion to suppress evidence obtained during an Oklahoma traffic stop.  According to the SEC's complaint, on August 12, 2015, Bryan J. Furman, an officer with the Iowa Department of Public Safety, intercepted communications from a mobile phone used by Mario Murillo-Mora, a member of the conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine in and around Marshalltown, Iowa. The complaint alleges that Murillo\u2013Mora allegedly used the phone to coordinate the illegal distribution of the drug, and that he used a fake name and birth certificate in an attempt to confuse law enforcement officers.  The complaint further alleges that, at the time of the alleged illegal distribution, Murillo and Mora were not cooperating with the government and were not authorized to conduct a thorough vehicle inventory.  At trial, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Perez-Trevino.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, impose civil penalties of up to five years, and impose officer-and-director and penny stock bars on the defendants. The court also granted the defendants the right to reapply for a jury trial in the future. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Castellanos. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, and the Iowa State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
