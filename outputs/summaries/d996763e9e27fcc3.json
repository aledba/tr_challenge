  "summary": "On May 1, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Washington entered a final judgment against Cavalry Investments, LLC, a Washington, D.C.-based private equity firm, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Seattle, alleges that Cavalry violated Section 15(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and that the court improperly granted affirmative relief on the basis of its finding that the defendants had not met their burden of proving the judgment had been satisfied.  According to the complaint, Cavalry also failed to provide an accounting of the Askinses\u2019 outstanding debt, which included prejudgment interest, costs, and attorney fees.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which, in its opinion, permanently enjoins Cavalry from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $11,158.94, a $10,053.00 default judgment, and orders Cavalry to return any remaining balance of the $7,754.39 owed on the underlying debt.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court in Seattle today entered an order to show cause why the court should not grant affirmative relief to Cavalry.  On May 2, 2020, the court granted Cavalry a temporary restraining order and ordered a hearing on the merits of the matter.  A hearing scheduled for May 4, 2020 will be conducted by James W. Moore, Daniel R. Coquillette, and Amy C. Hershfang of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, with assistance from Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Seattle Police Department, and the Washington State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
