  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against Frederick Ramirez, a Pennsylvania resident, on the merits of his motion to dismiss a prior court order that ordered him to file a timely filing of a petition to contest the Democratic Party nomination for representative of the 197th Legislative District.  According to the court's order, filed on June 20, 2018, Ramirez filed a notice of appeal on May 15, 1975, stating that he was contesting the Democratic nomination for state representative and that he would file a bond within five days of the date of filing the petition.  The court found that Ramirez failed to file the bond, which was required by Section 1759 of the Election Code.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Ramirez, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Ramirez consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the bond he has already paid.  On August 2, 2018 the court granted Ramirez's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from raising the issue of whether a bond should be filed with the court, and granted him the opportunity to file an application for a preliminary injunction against future violations.  At the same time, the court issued an order suspending Ramirez from appearing before the court for a hearing on the issues raised by the complaint.  As set forth in the order, Ramirez has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a hearing that is subject to court approval.  He has also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, charges Ramirez with violating Sections 1741(a) and (c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, and 1759(b) thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any such order.  Additionally, the complaint seeks a judgment ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a penalty of $250,000, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Philadelphia Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0"
