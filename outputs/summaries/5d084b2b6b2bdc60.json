  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Kansas announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against a Kansas City, Kan., EMS paramedic for failing to endorse a witness.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on June 23, 2014, an officer stopped and questioned Kyle Smith of the Kansas State Department of Health and Human Services (KSDHS) while he was driving his truck. The complaint alleges that Smith raised the issue of late endorsement of nonendangered witnesses by telling the officer that the law requires the state to endorse known witnesses when it files a complaint and only permits endorsement after that time if the state is unaware of the witness when it filed the complaint.  The complaint further alleges that Brosseit failed to adequately describe his training as an emergency medical services paramedic and about the procedure that he performs when drawing blood at the scene of a witness's arrest.  As alleged in the complaint, the state failed to endorse any witness at the time of filing the complaint and instead allowed the State to withhold the name of that witness until the date of the trial.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the state from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the district court to issue an order imposing a temporary restraining order, imposing a $10,000 civil penalty, and ordering the officer to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, which was filed in federal district court in Kansas City on February 20, 2016, the court issued an order suspending the suspension of the officer who recommended the suspension.  On March 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the U.C. District Court in Kansas granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws. The court also granted the Court of Appeals' request for an asset freeze and an officer-and-director bar.  A hearing is scheduled for May 24, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigation Release\u00c2\u00a0to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to determine whether to suspend or revoke a defendant's right to a preliminary breath test.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's case is being handled by Scott J. Mascianica, David A. Kasper, and Amy S. Cotter of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Kansas Department of Justice."
