  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Michael Messier, a Vermont resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, Messier attempted to serve Bushman with a summons and complaint by sheriff's service at her home on January 6 and February 1, 2017. The complaint alleges that Messier failed to timely respond to the summons or complaint and failed to provide a copy of the return of service on the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. Messier's complaint also alleges that Bushman filed an answer to the complaint on March 29, asserting insufficiency of service as an affirmative defense, and that the deputy sheriff's return was late by approximately four days.  The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, a federal court in New York granted a motion for summary judgment against Messier on January 13, 2017, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The court also denied Messier and his attorney's request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 12(b)(5) and Rule 12(a) and ordered Messier to pay a civil penalty of $15,000.  Messier has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $20,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a $10,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by C.J. Wright and A. Miller of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Messier.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Vermont Department of Insurance, and the Vermont Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
