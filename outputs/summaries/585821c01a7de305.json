  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for unlawfully withholding documents related to the agency's determination that a new pesticide product would have \"no effect\" on species protected under the Endangered Species Act of 1973.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, EPA failed to provide sufficient information to determine whether the requested documents were responsive to the requests.  In addition, the complaint alleges, as alleged in the complaint, that the agency failed to adequately record communications with the subject matter experts in its search for the documents.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the SEC has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the agency from violating these provisions, and orders it to submit a supplemental search of all materials. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Public Information and the Division of Enforcement's Office of Regulatory Affairs (OIEA) and has been supervised by Scott A. Thompson, Chief of the OIEA's Analysis and Detection Center. The litigation will be led by Michael J. Birkenheier and Graham Loomis. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Department of Justice, and the U.N. Office of Inspector General in this matter."
