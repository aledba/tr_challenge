  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in the course of his investigation, a child psychologist who was present at the time of the alleged abuse, provided expert testimony about the established protocols for conducting interviews of children.  According to the complaint, as part of the investigation, the defendant repeatedly raised the issue of whether or not he was being truthful in his testimony and whether he had engaged in an honest interview.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he had reviewed the evidence presented to the jury, including the testimony of a psychologist who had interviewed the victims and who had been present at trial when those interviews were conducted.  As alleged, however, that testimony was not admissible under the vouching rule because it was inconsistent with the facts of the case.  For example, the SEC alleges that when the defendant confronted the two victims about their allegations of abuse, he told them that he was upset with them because defendant had imposed dating restrictions on his daughter after discovering that she and her father had been intimate.  He also allegedly told the victims that he would \"trip[ing] herself up five minutes later\" if she said \"x\" in response to their questions.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Johnson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of the United States District Judge in the District of Columbia. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter, as well as the Missouri Department of Justice Criminal Division's Office of Professional and Risk Analysis."
