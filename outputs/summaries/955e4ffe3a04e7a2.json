  "summary": "On January 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee entered a final judgment against defendant Patrick Molloy, a former Assistant United States Attorney, for his failure to file a substantial assistance motion in a criminal prosecution in the Eastern District of Kentucky.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee on January 19, 2011, Molloys was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that, in 2011, defendant was convicted of drug trafficking and money laundering charges and sentenced to life imprisonment and to a concurrent sentence of 20 years on the money laundering charge. The SEC alleges that defendant was pressured by his former attorney, Dwaune Gravley, into filing a Rule 35 motion in exchange for his rebuttal testimony in a prison murder case prosecuted in Kentucky in 2011.  The complaint further alleges that the defendant was rushed for time and failed to make a substantial threshold showing that the government did not \"bargain away\" its discretion when it did not file a rule 35 motion.  In a parallel action, the federal district court in Tennessee today issued an order suspending Molluy from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  On January 24, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a penalty equal to the amount of his sentence.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit, and the case is being supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Koshy and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Attorney's Office, the United States Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Criminal Division's Office of Inspector General, the Tennessee Department of Banking and Securities and the Tennessee Office of the Attorney General."
