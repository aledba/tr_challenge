  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of nine felony counts of domestic violence, including first-degree assault constituting a felony, second-degree domestic battery, and first- and third-degree burglary constituting domestic violence. The court also found that defendant was entitled to a jury instruction defining \"substantial pain\" when, in reality, the victim suffered only fleeting pain. According to the court's order, defendant used a screwdriver to strike the victim in the face and hit her in the head with a closed fist.  The court granted the court\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order against defendant and ordered him to return to court on a later date.  On May 3rd, the court entered a judgment against defendant that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against defendant. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, charges defendant with violating Section 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(3) of Securities Act of 1933, and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunctive relief, and a penalty equal to or equal to the amount of any civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge $1,038,829, and ordering a $100,000 civil penalty against him. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (January 24, 2019)."
