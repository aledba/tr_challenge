  "summary": "On March 21, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against defendant Terell Davison, Jr., who was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to 50 years in prison.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on January 29, 2013, defendant was arrested by the Chicago Police Department for the murder of Anthony Jones. According to the complaint, the officers observed a woman exit the house and approached the woman. The complaint alleges that the officers asked the woman if she was tired of running and glad the police caught her. The woman replied, \"No.\" The complaint further alleges that as a result of a conversation he had with a non-testifying witness, one of the officers suggested that the defendant had used a firearm during the course of his investigation. The court ruled that the officer should not have been allowed to testify to the names Taylor provided because it went beyond what was necessary to explain the detective's subsequent conduct.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against Davison. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against him.  On March 22, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendant to return to the scene of the alleged crime. The judge granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The order also prohibits the defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with a criminal investigation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Davison consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $250,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing scheduled for April 24, 2016 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern. The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Chicago Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the Illinois State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
