  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against BMW of North America, LLC (\"BMW\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 17(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that BMW failed to comply with the court's order to produce documents related to similar engine oil consumption and air conditioning defects in vehicles of the same year, make, and model as Michael Jensen's vehicle.  According to the complaint, BMW's searches yielded 83,000 hits in the Warranty Repair database, but 0.01 hit in the Customer Relations/Contacts database.  BMW also failed to produce any documents.  In a parallel action, on March 4, 2019, the court granted BMW's motion for sanctions and ordered the production of documents and a supporting declaration from BMW, stating that the search produced no results.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, BMW consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders BMW to pay a civil penalty of $1100.00, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that BMW will pay to the court upon a finding of liability in the case.  On April 9, 2019 the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part BMW's request for sanctions, requiring BMW to produce certain documents within a certain timeframe, and requiring it to submit an affidavit confirming that it complied with the order.  As set forth in its order, BMW also agreed to be required to provide an accounting of the number of hits in its books and records that it had found in the warranty repair database, which it knew was not sufficient to produce results in the other two databases.  Additionally, BMW agreed to pay an additional $100,000 in civil penalties and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any automobile for a period of five years.  It also agreed not to impose a penny stock bar against BMW.  Finally, BMW has agreed to a settlement where it will pay a $10,000 penalty and be prohibited from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Jenson and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the San Diego Regional Office."
