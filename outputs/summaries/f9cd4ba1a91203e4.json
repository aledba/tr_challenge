  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a second amended complaint alleging that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 29, 2015, filed in federal district court in New York City, the defendants, Associated Auction Services, Ziegler, and Thompson Tractor, LLC, falsely claimed that they had an agreement to withhold used equipment from IronPlanet, Inc., a manufacturer of new heavy construction equipment, from participating in a planned merger between the two companies.  The complaint alleges that the defendants made the same threat to IronPlanet in a letter to the company's then-head of sales, telling the company that it would withhold equipment from the company unless it terminated its relationship with ICP.  In reality, according to the complaint, none of these statements were true, and the defendants used the same means to exclude ICP from the market for used equipment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the amended complaint, ICP consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burtch and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0On September 30, 2019, the SEC filed an amended complaint charging the defendants with violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and charges them with violating Sections 9(a), 10(c) and 13(b)(2) and 14(a) of Exchange Act Rules 10b2-1, 13a-11, and 14a-13 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Act of 1933.
