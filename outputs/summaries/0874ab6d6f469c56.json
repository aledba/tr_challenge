  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Houston-area commercial pilot for his role in an alleged insider threat.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that Nicholas Bonacci, a commercial pilot based at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, was randomly selected for passenger screening when reporting for his assigned duties. According to the complaint, Bonacci was not only subject to TSA\u2019s pat-down procedures, but was also subject to random screening. The complaint further alleges that Bonacci filed a petition for review on April 11, 2017, alleging that TSA lacked statutory authority to subject airline crewmembers to \u201cpassenger screening,\u201d including pat-downs, and that a judgment preventing him from doing so would not be sufficient. The SEC alleges that, contrary to these claims, TSA did not impose any such restrictions on Bonacci. Rather, the complaint alleges that the agency reviewed the background of the individual who filed the complaint and determined that he was not a threat to the safety of the United States and that he had no reasonable basis to challenge the TSA policies. In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting Bonacci's motion for review. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, however, the agency has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Bonacci from future violations and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,078, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the court. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Bonacci on March 29, 2017. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Mr. LaJoye. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter.  For further information, see Press Release No. 17-1116 (Feb. 19, 2017).
