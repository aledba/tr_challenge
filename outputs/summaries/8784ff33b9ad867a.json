  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment finding that New York common law does not provide a right of public performance for pre-1972 sound recordings.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, on February 15, 1972, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and an injunction preventing New York-based recording companies from violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC alleges that Schneiderman violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Schneiderman agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Schneiderman.  On February 24, 2017, the U. S. District Judge for the District of Manhattan granted Schneiderman's motion for summary judgment and ordered him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his profits. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the New York Office of the Attorney General's Office and is being supervised by Marc Blau. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter, the Office of Inspector General, and the Department of Justice's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy.
