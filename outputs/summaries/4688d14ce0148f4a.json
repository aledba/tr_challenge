  "summary": "On January 17, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of North Dakota entered a final judgment against Chad Schultz, a former township assessor, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000.  The court also ordered Chad to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $140,000 and $150,000, respectively.  According to the court's order, Chad brought more property into the marriage than Kelli, including a one-half acre parcel of farmland.  Chad's father, Herbert Schultz, testified to his opinion that the property should be allocated evenly between the parties.  As alleged in the complaint, the district court's allocation of the farmland was not induced by an erroneous view of the law, was within the range of the evidence presented, and was consistent with the value of the property at the time the parties were married.  In addition, the court found Chad to have had a long-term marriage when he brought in the property in 2001.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, Chad consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Chad to disgorge ill-earned gains with interest, pay civil monetary penalties, and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The court also issued a temporary restraining order against Chad, barring him from participating in any estate planning or investment decisions, freezing his assets, and ordering a hearing on the merits of the case.  On January 24, 2019, a federal district court in Fargo, N.D. issued an order appointing a receiver to determine the appropriate allocation of marital property.  It also appointed a receiver for the receiver of the receiver's assets, to determine whether the receiver is entitled to an equitable distribution of the marital estate.  To determine the receiver, the receiver must first determine the total value of a certain piece of property in the estate before it can allocate the receiver to the receiver.  For example, in the case of Face 2 Face Salon, Chad, who lives in Jamestown, North Dakota, requested an equal division of the estate between the amounts suggested by the parties in the Ruff-Fischer guidelines. The district court found the property to be worth $1,476/acre, and ordered a series of post-judgment equalization payments from Chad to Kelli. The receiver agreed to a 4% interest rate on any payment taking place over the course of the year."
