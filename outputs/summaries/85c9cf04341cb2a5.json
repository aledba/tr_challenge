  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for a second-degree rape of his daughter.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Roads, Louisiana, alleges that on November 13, 2018, a jury found Gerald Samuel guilty as charged with the first degree rape of N.P., a child under the age of thirteen.  According to the complaint, the jury deliberated for nearly two hours before finding Samuel guilty on all counts and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, on January 22, 2019, the court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and imposed a mandatory life sentence without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint. The court also denied the defendant's motion to add a second trial date for a third time, and ordered the jury to determine whether to impose a penalty based on the evidence presented in the trial.  On February 5, 2020, the Honorable Gerald A. McClellan of the United States District Court in the Eastern District of New York entered a judgment against Samuel that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, and orders him to repay the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest in a civil penalty of $2,500. The final judgment also prohibits Samuel from serving as an officer or director of a public agency and from participating in the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order. The Court also ordered the defendant to pay disgorgement of $3,500, which is equal to the amount he has already paid in restitution to the victims of the alleged rapes.  Without admitting or denied the SEC allegations, Samuel consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 15a of the Exchange Act and Rule 15a-1 thereunder. The judgment also ordered him to be barred from serving any prison term for five years and ordered to pay $1 million in restitution.  A hearing on February 13, 2020 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. for the SEC to consider the merits of the case against Samuel. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Louisiana State Attorney General's Office, and the Louisiana Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
