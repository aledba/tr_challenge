  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against four officers of the Baltimore Police Department for their participation in a racketeering conspiracy and substantive acts of racketeering, in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Baltimore, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and that they violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose to the jury that the officers engaged in a scheme to steal money from victims.  According to the complaint, the defendants also failed to disclose that one of the officers was under investigation for drug-related criminal activity.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Taylor and Hersl, who were also charged in the RICO case, were not present at the time of the alleged robbery when the officers entered the house without a warrant and searched the house.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, however, the officers did not steal the money from the victims and instead used the stolen money to make payments to a bank account they controlled.  Instead, the SEC alleges that one officer was arrested and the other was later convicted.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC complaint, Taylor, Hersl and the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restate the facts of the case and order them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains.  On March 22, 2018, the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial and ordered the officers to submit to the court a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, orders them to return their stolen cars, and orders the officer to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the judge granted the officers\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from using the internet, from accessing the phone, and from making any phone calls or sending any mail to anyone in the United States.  Finally, the jury was instructed not to search the home of any of the defendants and to check the background of anyone selling or offering them any services that may be related to the alleged scheme.  To settle the SEC case, the defendant and his co-defendant agreed to settle the case by consenting to permanent injunctions and to the imposition of civil penalties of $100,000 each.   The settlement is subject to court approval."
