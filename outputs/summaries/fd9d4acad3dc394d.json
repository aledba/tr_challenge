  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the Public Utilities Commission of California (\"PUC\") for denying an income tax allowance to a limited partnership that pays no income taxes.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, the PUC issued a series of ratesetting orders in May 2011, including one that incorrectly concluded that SFPP paid no income tax when it did not.  The complaint alleges that, based on this finding, the Commission failed to consider the merits of the proposed allowance, and instead relied on a set of boiler-room accounting principles to determine the appropriate rate of return.  In its final judgment, the court found that the Commission violated Section 1757 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), the Commission improperly granted an exemption to certain utilities for purposes of setting rates.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from violating Section 1759 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"), and orders the Commission to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The Commission's final judgment also prohibits the imposition of a penny stock bar, and prohibits the issuance of an officer-and-director bar. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger in the San Francisco Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).
