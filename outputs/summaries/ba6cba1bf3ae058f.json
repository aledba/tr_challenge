  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Florida resident Nikesh Patel, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in selling $179 million in fraudulent loans to an investment advisor. Patel pleaded guilty to all five counts and delayed his sentencing date for a year while he purported to help recover funds for the victims of his scheme. Patel also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. Patel has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws and to a five-year officer-and-director bar. Patel agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal district court in New York on March 6, 2018. Patel will be sentenced on April 9, 2018, and his sentencing is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Florida Department of Banking and Securities, and the Florida Office of Inspector General.

The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Patel arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.

Patel is also barred from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal bond dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. Patel previously pleaded guilty in a parallel criminal case to one charge of wire fraud. Patel's sentencing hearing was scheduled for March 6. Patel filed a civil injunctive action in federal court against the federal government on January 9, 2019, and was subsequently sentenced to prison terms ranging from 25 years to 100 years.
