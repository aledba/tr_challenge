  "summary": "On August 5, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the Louisiana State Attorney General's Office (\"Securities and Exchange Commission\") in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, alleges that the Louisiana Attorney General improperly delegated the SEC's authority to determine the jurisdiction of the juvenile court to determine whether a child should be criminally prosecuted as an adult pursuant to the federal criminal laws.  According to the complaint, D.T. retrieved a black semiautomatic weapon during an altercation outside his residence and fired two or three times into a car in which two women and a baby were seated. The complaint alleges that, after the alleged battery was committed, the defendant was not charged with a second or subsequent aggravated battery, and the court found probable cause for the child to register as a sex offender for life.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced that it filed criminal charges against the defendant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On August 6, the SEC filed a civil action against the state Attorney General, alleging that the Legislature overstepped its authority in granting the SEC a temporary restraining order, imposing a $75,000 civil penalty, and appointing a receiver to determine when to issue an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the attorney general consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $25,000 penalty, imposes a $50,000 bar, and requires him to surrender to law enforcement at the discretion of the district attorney.  A hearing on August 13, 2019 was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Eastern.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the New Orleans Regional Office and supervised by Eric Werner of the Office of the Chief of the Division of Juvenile Justice. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Texas Department of Banking and Securities and the Alabama Department of Health and Human Services."
