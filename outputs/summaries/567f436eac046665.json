  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Jersey on May 16, 2017, Roland Summit, a clinical psychiatrist and advocate for child victims of child sexual abuse, and his co-defendant, Dr. Anthony D'Urso, agreed with the court's finding that CSAAS is not a diagnostic tool and that it is not supported by scientific evidence.  The court also found that, contrary to what the complaint alleges, most victims delay disclosing their abuse and recant their allegations.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Summit for his role in the alleged scheme.  On May 17, 2017 the U. S. District Judge granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order suspending the defendant from appearing before the court as an expert witness.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Summit consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and bars him from participating in any future securities offering or offering of securities in the securities of any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the New York Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson, Mr. Werner, and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Office of Inspector General, and the FBI in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (January 17, 2019)."
