  "summary": "On August 16, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky entered a final judgment in favor of the Rowan County Fiscal Court in its motion for summary judgment against the defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Memphis, Tennessee, alleges that defendants violated the First Amendment when the Fiscal Court refused to grant it permission to erect a fence and an electric gate on its property in 2014.  According to the complaint, the court denied the request for the variance because it knew of plaintiff\u2019s support of Blevins in the local election and did not grant the variance.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant Ray White and two of his attorneys, James Frazier and Jaron Blandford, refused to sit for their depositions, citing confidentiality concerns under the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal  securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,038, and orders the defendants to pay prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,037, and requires them to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest in a civil penalty of $100,000.  On August 24, 2016, the Court granted summary judgment to the defendants in their individual capacities, without prejudice to the relief sought by the SEC in its action against the other defendants in this matter.   The court also entered a temporary restraining order against defendants, barring them from participating in any future actions related to this matter, freezing their assets, and ordering the destruction of any evidence that may be relevant to the case.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 57419 (Aug. 24, 2017).  The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction against future actions by the defendants, as well as a penalty from the court for any further action by the defendant.  Finally, the SEC is seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions against further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws and a conduct-based injunction prohibiting defendants from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in the securities of any broker, dealer, municipal, municipal securities dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
