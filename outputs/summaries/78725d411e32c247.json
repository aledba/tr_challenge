  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of Lisa N. Bostick, a University of Tampa accounting professor, against State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (S.D. Fla. 2009).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Tampa, Florida, alleges that, in mid-November 2013, a jury deliberated for an hour and a half before finding that the defendant had suffered grave bodily injuries and was liable to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that the jury was not required to consider the merits of the defendant's claims and instead excused him from the jury room because he was a \"holdout juror.\"  According to the complaint, the jury did not have the opportunity to consider whether or not Mr. Samelton was liable for the injuries and therefore she sued State Farm seeking underinsured/uninsured motorist benefits in state court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On November 2, 2017, the court granted the SEC's motion for a new trial and ordered the jury to return a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of $257,315.95 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Bostck's motion also seeks a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against her from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a juror.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating Sections 10(e) and 13(b)(2)(A) and 14(c) and 15(a) of The Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interests, pay civil penalties, and pay a $1.038 million civil penalty.  State Farm agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the issuance of an order requiring it to be entered by the court that it will determine the amount of monetary penalties to be imposed upon each defendant. The court also granted the defendants' requests for a hearing on November 7, 2017 and a hearing scheduled for November 8, 2017. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Florida Office of Inspector General."
