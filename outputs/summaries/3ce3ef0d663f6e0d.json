  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment in favor of the parties in a civil action in which the court found that the parties violated the antifraud provisions of Section 523(a)(2)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  The court granted the parties' requests for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, as well as an order requiring the parties to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the court's order, filed on May 2, 2019, the parties agreed that it was uniquely difficult to prove damages in this case because the parties had poor institutional control over its inventory, (1) Defendant destroyed all of its paper records related to the disputed deliveries in the case, and (2) Defendant failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claims.  In a parallel action, the court issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a defendant.  On June 25, 2019 the court granted a temporary injunction and ordered the defendants to pay $74,799.50 in attorneys' fees and $7,981.31 in costs.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $2,490. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 54(e)(3).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Idaho, charges the defendants with violations of the anti-fraud provisions and seeks a permanent injunction and a penalty equal to the amount of attorney's fees requested. The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, which was entered without prejudice by the court on June 26, 2019.   The complaint also seeks a temporary asset freeze, an order to halt the issuance of any emergency court order, and an order appointing a receiver for the relief sought by the parties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael Roe, Alex McLaughlin, and Keri Moody of the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Mr. Roe and Ms. McLaughlin. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Idaho Office of Financial Regulation, and the Idaho State Auditor's Office in this matter."
