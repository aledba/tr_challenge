  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against the State of New Mexican for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that the state violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on March 5, 2014, the State violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10-7E-19 of the Exchange Act.  In its complaint, the complaint alleges that, prior to the implementation of the exchange agreement, the state had not established a binding past practice for paying bargaining unit employees for time spent preparing for and participating in grievance meetings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, however, the Department of Labor and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have agreed to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin the State from violating these provisions and order it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $20,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On January 23, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the state, charging the State with violating the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Exchange Act and Rules 5b-20, 17a-1, and (2) and (3) thereunder, and against the District Court's order requiring the State to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $25,000 and $10,000, respectively, for each of the parties' alleged violations of the above-mentioned provisions. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the parties. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the New Mexico Office of Inspector General and the Division of Labor's Analysis and Detection Center.
