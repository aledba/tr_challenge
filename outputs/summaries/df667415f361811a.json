  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against Lamine Camara, a Virginia resident, for his involvement in a scheme to acquire and resell luxury vehicles using stolen identities.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, Camara was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC alleges that, by charging Camara as it did, the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was in the business of receiving and selling stolen property, that he was a co-conspirator, and that, in fact, he was not a part of the conspiracy.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Camara participated in five transactions within the scheme, paying as little as one-tenth of the market value of the vehicles.  Camara allegedly connected three other individuals, each of whom paid Ekobena and two of whom ultimately received stolen vehicles from him.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the defendants were not associated with any separate conspiracy, as the SEC alleges, and the defendants did not have any connection between their crime and the district in which they were charged.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On the same day, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Camara and ordered him to surrender his passport, which he did not do.   The court also issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting Camara from participating in the sale, purchase, offer, or sale of any luxury car, including luxury cars, without a valid driver's license, and requires him to show cause and effect the purchase, sale, or offer of a vehicle.  Additionally, the SEC charged Camara with conspiracy to commit a capital felony, on the basis of his receipt of stolen cars from a dealership, and charged him with aiding and abetting a separate, unrelated, and unrelated criminal enterprise.  It also charged him for violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and Section 15(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rules 5b2-1 and 17a-3 thereunder, and with violating Section 17(b).  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against both Camara"
