  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona today entered a final judgment in favor of the injured vinyl flooring installer, who was sentenced to five years of supervised release in October 2015.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, alleges that J.R. McDade Company, Inc. and its owner, Lee Moor Contracting Co. (formerly known as Adams Insulation Co.), improperly awarded Simmons a five-percent scheduled disability based on the fact that he missed three months of work due to a diabetic-related toe infection in late 2013.  According to the complaint, Simmons was suffering from diabetic peripheral neuropathy, which causes pain and numbness in the lower extremities, and required him to work a non-traditional schedule during his year-long tenure with the company.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, when Simmons was released to work in early 2014, after nearly two years of medical treatment, Simmons had reached maximum medical improvement, rating the permanent impairment to his right upper extremity at five percent.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Simmons consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans of the U. S. District court for the Northern District of New York issued an order granting Simmons a temporary restraining order and ordering him to return to work on July 1, 2019.   The court also issued an Order suspending Simmons from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any securities in the United States, including the securities of publicly-traded companies, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against him. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Arizona Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Arizona Department of Health and Human Services."
