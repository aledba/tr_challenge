  "summary": "On January 29, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment in favor of Mid-Continent Casualty Company v. Northstar Builders, Inc., a Florida-based insurance company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that Ruben Rangel suffered catastrophic injuries in a fall from a roof while working at a residential construction site, resulting in catastrophic injuries.  According to the complaint, Rangel's fall from the roof was so severe that he was unable to perform the roofing work required to qualify for workers' compensation benefits under Florida law.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Northstar and Caribe Edge violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Additionally, the court has issued an order suspending the registration of certain of the defendants' claims against them, freezing their assets, and ordering a temporary restraining order against them from further violating the securities laws.  On February 21, 2017, the United States District Court in Miami entered a judgment against the Rangels, finding them liable for violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Florida's Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 206(3)-7 thereunder, ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against each of them.   In a parallel action, the federal district court in Orlando, Florida issued a summary judgment on December 4, 2017 finding Northstar liable for liability arising from the company's alleged violations of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The court also issued a preliminary injunction against Northstar, Caribe, and DEAA Enterprises, Inc. (collectively, the \"Defendants\") from violating the provisions of the Commission's order, ordering Northstar to comply with the Commission Order, ordering Caribe to pay an $8,500 civil penalty, and requiring DEAA to provide a \"procedural fencing\" to prevent Northstar from violating Section 206. The Commission also ordered the company to provide an accounting of its losses, which it did not do.  Among other things, the Commission found that the company violated Sections 206, 206, and 206 (1), and that it was not entitled to an election of remedies as a matter of law."
