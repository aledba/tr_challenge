  "summary": "On July 19, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia entered a final judgment against Safe-Guard Products International, LLC (\"Safe-Guard\"), a West Virginia limited liability company that offered Guaranteed Auto Protection (GAP) insurance to vehicle purchasers in West Virginia.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Charleston, West Virginia, from July 2006 through July 2011, Hinkle, a resident of Delbarton, W.Va., purchased GAP insurance in violation of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that, by selling the insurance, she was not entitled to a duty to pay and, as a result of a prior purchase of insurance, did not qualify as a \"debt\" under the WVCCPA.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court also ruled that SafeGuard violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it violated the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) and 5(b)(5) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The court's final judgment, which is subject to approval by the court, permanently enjoins SafeGuard from violating these provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $5,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for West Virginia today announced criminal charges against Hinkle.  On July 24, 2015, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott Runyan and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Ms. Hinkle and Mr. Runyan.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia Secretary of State's Office, and the Virginia Attorney General's Office in this matter."
