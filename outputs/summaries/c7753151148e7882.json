  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against TargetSmart Holdings, LLC and its competitor, GHP Advisors, LLC, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1404(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston on January 23, 2019, TargetSmart alleges that GHP and GHP agreed to a settlement in which GHP would be required to show cause and effect, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, that it had acted as an agent of GHP in connection with a potential acquisition of TargetSmart.  The SEC alleges that the settlement is subject to court approval.  TargetSmart also agreed to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against GHP.
