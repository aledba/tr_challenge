  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Robert Temple Summers, III, a convicted felon, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Summers, while indigent, was ordered to pay court-appointed attorney fees as part of a community supervision order. The court found that Summers had not waived his right to appeal by failing to raise the issues raised in the complaint, and therefore was not entitled to an attorney to represent him in these cases.  In addition, the court also ordered Summers to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, Summers agreed to pay $219 in court costs and $400 in court appointed attorney fees in each of these cases, and agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions.  On April 4, 2017, the trial court entered judgments ordering Summers to repay court-ordered attorney fees and ordered him to pay community supervision costs.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, Summers has forfeited his complaints by not raising the issues in these appeals.  For example, the SEC alleges that in one of the cases, Summers pleaded guilty to evading arrest with a motor vehicle in April 2016 and was sentenced to twenty-four months in the institutional division, suspended for five years, and ordered on community supervision for the second time in 2017. The SEC further alleges that, in the other case, Summers was found indigent and unable to pay any amount in attorney fees at the time that he was sentenced.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Summers consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws. The final judgments, which were issued on April 4 and April 5, 2017 respectively, require that Summers pay a total of $450. $350 in court fees and $100.00 in court expenses, and require that he pay court costs of $219. In the third case, the Court of Criminal Appeals issued a final judgment that permanently enjoins Summers from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney under the supervision provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and orders Summers to comply with the agreed-upon financial obligations of Section 5(b). The court also issued a written judgment imposing community supervision on Summers. The judgments also impose a penalty of $250,000, and the court appointed counsel for each case is required to pay the court costs"
