  "summary": "On October 30, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana entered a final judgment in favor of the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, alleges that Christian Constantin violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  According to the complaint, Constantin was arrested on March 10, 2019 and booked into EBR Parish Prison on March 14, 2019. The complaint alleges that, before he was transported from Parish Prison to the EBRSO Financial Crimes Division to be interviewed by Corporal Leigh Rice, Constantin made several statements admitting to criminal conduct, including that he was a member of the gypsy social class in Romania and that he had no degree or familiarity with the criminal justice system.   The complaint further alleges that Constantin was able to express to Corporal Rice his concern about his wife and that his wife was a juvenile, which resulted in the decision not to book her into Parish Prison.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Constantin.  On November 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Constantin, charging him with violations of Section 13(b)(5) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  In its complaint, the Commission charged Constantin with violating Section 15(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Constantin consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil monetary penalty of $100,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Rice.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
