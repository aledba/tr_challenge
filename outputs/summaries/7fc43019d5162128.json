  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against two defendants for breach of contract arising from a real estate transaction.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on May 2, 2018, Hartwell P. Morse III and Deborah B. Morse, of Clarendon Hills, Illinois, entered into a contract for the sale of property to defendants for $410,000, which was contingent upon the bank's approval of the short sale.  The SEC alleges that defendants failed to disclose that the collateral-source rule, generally applied in tort cases, requires defendants to show that they suffered no actual loss.  In addition, the court found that defendants' short-sale agreement with the bank required them to pay a penalty equal to the amount of their losses.  As alleged in the complaint, however, defendants did not have to show any actual loss, because the bank had already repaid the $35,000 owed to them.  Instead, the complaint alleges that plaintiffs failed to adequately disclose to the court that the bank owed them a penalty of $3608 plus costs.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint or the SEC, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to their respective amounts of ill-gotten gains with respect to the amounts of their civil penalties.   The court also granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment against Hartwell and Morse, and granted the parties' request for an emergency court order halting the foreclosure proceedings.  On May 4, 2019, a federal district court in Illinois entered a judgment ordering the court to consider the merits of Hartwell's and Morse's claims against the defendants in a case that was not related to the actual loss of the property.  It also ordered Hartwell to comply with the court's order barring him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any real estate for which he or she is entitled to a judgment as to whether or not to do a short sale of the real estate.  Hartwell agreed to settle the case by consenting to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay civil penalties of $10,000 and $20,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. "
