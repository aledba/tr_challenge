  "summary": "On July 25, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against Jane Worthington, a resident of Mount Pleasant Township, Pennsylvania, who has been charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the Township and appointing a receiver to oversee the development of the well and well pad.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, Worthingtons raised the issue of whether she was entitled to standing as a party in an application for a conditional use permit for an oil and gas well pad located less than one mile from the school where her granddaughter attends. The complaint alleges that, contrary to the Board's decision denying Worthingttton party status, she was not an aggrieved party in the matter.  In its order, the court granted the District Attorney's Office's request for an emergency asset freeze and other emergency relief, including an asset freeze, an emergency telephone line, and an emergency court order to halt the construction of the Well Site. The court's order, which was entered on July 17, 2018 and unsealed on July 24, 2018 by the court, reserves the issues of standing and jurisdiction for further determination by the Division of Enforcement. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans and Glenn S. Gordon. The Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
