  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered final judgments in favor of the defendants in a civil action brought by Sweet Lake Land & Oil Company, L.L.C. and Oleum Operating Co., L.C., alleging that they failed to pay the overriding royalty interest due to Sweet Lake's failure to produce oil and gas in paying quantities.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, Mississippi on July 2, 2008, Oleum and Sweet Lake violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to comply with their obligations under the Exchange Act, and failed to provide timely and sufficient evidence to determine whether they were entitled to a partial summary judgment.  The complaint further alleges that Oleum failed to inform Sweet Lake that it was entitled to an offset and/or recoupment of the ORI payments made to Mr. Suire and that it had improperly taken certain offsets from the 1947 Lease in failing to provide J & J Onshore notice of its attempt to release the lease.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Steven Haller and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the New Orleans Regional Office. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Mississippi, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Louisiana Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
