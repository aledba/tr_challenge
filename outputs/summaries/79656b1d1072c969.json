  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Amtrak and a member of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen (BRL) for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Columbia, alleges that Amtrak violated the collective bargaining agreement and thus the scope of work under the federal contract.  According to the complaint, from 1989 to 2015, Amtrak and the union negotiated a collective agreement that guaranteed to the union all existing work at the time of the agreement, including signalmen work in the newly acquired REA Building.  As alleged, however, the scope rule does not apply to new work performed by train service employees.  For example, the complaint alleges that in 1984, when Amtrak acquired the ReA Building, it required the union to contract out work that was not part of the collective agreement.  In addition, in 1992, when the union purchased the building, it did not require the union's representation to perform any scope work at that time.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Amtrak agreed to the final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On June 30, 2017, the court granted Amtrak's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered it to settle the matter by the end of the day. The court's order also requires Amtrak to provide an accounting of the amount of work that has been performed at the Washington, D.C. train-services union facilities since the early 1980s.  It also orders Amtrak to pay civil penalties of $500,000 and $1 million, respectively, for each work performed in the new REA building. The order also prohibits the issuance of any cease-and-desist letter or order from the federal district courts, including those issued by the court in this matter.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Amtrak for its role in the alleged violations of the federal collective bargaining provisions. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David J. Ingersoll and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maryland Secretary of State's Office, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission."
