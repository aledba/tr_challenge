  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a company that filed a siting application for a municipal solid waste transfer station in Will County, Illinois.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on Dec. 12, 2014, Environmental Recycling and Disposal Services, Inc. (ERDS) filed an application for siting approval in the Will County Service Area.  The complaint alleges that ERDS failed to meet certain criteria in its application, including that the proposed facility would handle an average of 200 tons per day of solid waste, that it could not handle more than 200 tons of waste, and that it did not have the capacity to handle all of the waste.  In addition, the complaint alleged that the application omitted information about the capacity of the transfer station, which was not met by the Pollution Control Board's criteria.  As alleged in the complaint, ERDS also failed to provide evidence that the facility was necessary to meet the requirements of section 39.2(a) of the Environmental Protection Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them. The settlements are subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Eric Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Department of Environmental Quality, the Illinois State Department of Health, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
