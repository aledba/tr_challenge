  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Robert Taylor, a convicted felon who was sentenced to five years of community control and ordered to pay $250,000 in court-appointed counsel fees.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 19, 2016, Taylor was indicted for one count of rape of a person less than thirteen years of age in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1) and a felony of the third degree.  The complaint alleges that the trial court improperly ordered Taylor to pay a $130 court appointed counsel fee, a $250 supervision fee, and court costs, which were later calculated to be $1,138. The complaint also alleges that Taylor failed to inform his trial counsel of his obligation to pay the $130 fee at sentencing.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Taylor.  On November 2, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation entered a judgment against Taylor that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay restitution of $250. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. McCole and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. McGole. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.
