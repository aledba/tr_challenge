  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment in favor of the city of Philadelphia and its liquor licensees in a case that was investigated by the Philadelphia Regional Office.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office (Secretary of State) issued a false and misleading statement to the public regarding the availability of liquor licenses in Pennsylvania.  According to the complaint, the secretary of state's Office of Licensing and Regulation and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (SHOH) had previously issued an order requiring Pennsylvania liquor license holders to apply for a liquor license.  SHOH previously issued a similar order in 2016.  In its order, SHOH issued a temporary restraining order and issued a cease-and-desist order against SHOH, which, in effect, prohibited SHOH from issuing liquor licenses to SHOH-licensed establishments. SHOH also temporarily suspended SHOH's ability to issue liquor licenses for SHOH and HOH-related businesses.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, Human Services, and the Department of Justice today announced that SHOH has agreed to settle the case. SHAH agreed to pay $2,500 in disgorgement, $1,000 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  ShOH also agreed to a $50,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0SHOH agreed to be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay a $75,000 penalty in the amount of $20,000, $10,000 and a $25,000 joint bar. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Philadelphia Office of Municipal Affairs. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania State Police, the Philadelphia Police Department, the State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Pennsylvania Office of Financial Regulation in this matter."
