  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment in favor of a Colorado-based insurance company in a civil injunctive action brought by a former employee who sustained serious injuries in a car accident.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Kent Ryser suffered serious injuries while driving a car and sought UM/UIM benefits under an insurance policy maintained by another co-employee who owned the car. The complaint alleges that Forster was at fault for the accident, and the policy excluded him from UM/UM/UI benefits.  The complaint further alleges that forster was immune from liability because he had not procured workers\u2019 compensation insurance.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Forster. The SEC also announced that it would conduct an investigation into the matter, which is ongoing.  A hearing on the matter is scheduled for May 24, 2018.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Secretary of State Department of Health and Human Services and the Colorado Office of Insurance Regulation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling or offering them investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov website\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC also issued an\u00c2\u00a0Order\u00c2\u00a0requiring\u00c2\u00a0for investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling investments using the SEC Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature.  Investors should be aware that the SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions investors to be wary of investments in companies that do not offer workers' compensation coverage.  For example, in a recent case, a federal district court in New York granted a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct an internal investigation into whether the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $15,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 25, 2018, the court granted a preliminary injunction against Rysers and ordered a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, including Section 10-4-609, and ordered him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,038,"
