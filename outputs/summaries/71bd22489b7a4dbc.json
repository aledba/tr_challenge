  "summary": "On August 23, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Shawn Michael Taylor, Jr., a Peoria, Illinois man who was convicted of attempted residential burglary.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Taylor was arrested on May 26, 2016.  The complaint alleges that Taylor was confronted with a pattern of prosecutorial conduct that would be difficult to defend.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendant repeatedly told the arresting officer that he \"leaned in to talk to [defendant] to read him his Miranda rights\" and that he had occasion to meet with the defendant later that night.  In addition, the complaint alleges, Taylor allegedly heard a \"heavy pounding [or] heavy kicking\" on the house and saw a man running and wearing a dark hooded sweatshirt and khaki pants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Taylor consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Department of Criminal Justice."
