  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against Aetna Life Insurance Company (Aetna), a Connecticut-based managed care company, and two companies it controls, for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, alleges that AETna Life violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, that, for its self-insured health plans, AETNA Life violated Rule 13a-14, which requires that a court determine whether a party is a \"real and substantial party in interest\" in a diversity jurisdiction case.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the SEC's order, the defendants agreed to settle the litigation without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. The SEC also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be imposed upon the defendants in the future. The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 30, 2011).  The U. S.
