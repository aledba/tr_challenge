  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former registered representative of the Department of Social Security denying her claim for Social Security disability benefits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Miriam R. Graham, a registered representative at St. Vincent DePaul Medical Center, was falsely told that she had a long history of lower back pain and that she was able to perform light work.  According to the complaint, however, Graham was not able to do any of the work required for her to qualify for the benefits because of her severe back pain.  Instead, the complaint alleges that Graham had a history of back pain that was exacerbated by medication she took to treat it.  In addition, Graham's medical records, which were reviewed by the SEC's Office of Clinical Education and Advocacy, show that Graham has \"moderate to moderate limitations with respect to her right hand\" and \"mild to moderate limitation in personal grooming and activities of daily living secondary to shortness of breath and allergies.\"  The complaint further alleges that when Graham appealed her decision to the SEC, she was repeatedly denied medication for the condition and consistently denied having a \"reasonable probability\" that she would perform the work she had done in the past, when she had been diagnosed with severe migraine and vertigo.  Graham also allegedly had developed a severe back ache, which required her to cover the windows with sheets to keep the light from bothering her.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, Graham also has a severe anxiety disorder, which requires her to use her left hand to hold a bottle of water.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Graham consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17, July 17, 2018.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Graham on September 21, 2017, for her participation in a clinical trial that was conducted in the Office of the Chief Medical Officer in the Division of Health and Human Services (OHSA).  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone, with assistance from John R. Rymas, and the litigation will be led by Ms. Graham. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and"
