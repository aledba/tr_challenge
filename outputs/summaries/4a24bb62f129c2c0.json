  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against Loomis Sayles & Company, Inc., a financial services company, and its former president, Joel Weiss, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Weiss, as president of JoSol, Inc. (\"JoSol\"), a large information technology staffing firm, misclassified him as an independent contractor rather than an employee.  According to the complaint, Weiss was the only JoSol employee authorized to perform the services in issue, and he spent an additional ten to twenty hours per week on a cash flow project for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  Weiss's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges LoomIS and Weiss with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 148B of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending Weiss from appearing or practicing before the Commission on Economic and Risk, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to Weiss's pre-judgment interest in the matter.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by John Gidman, Kevin McGuire, and Luke Antolini of the Boston Regional Office, and was supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gwazda. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Massachusetts Department of Banking and Securities."
