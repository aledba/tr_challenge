  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against Kansas Secretary of Social and Rehabilitation Services (KSVPA) defendant Richard A. Quillen for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Kansas City, Kansas on April 16, 2018, the court entered a consent decree that requires the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a person with a mental abnormality or personality disorder is safe to be placed in transitional release. The consent decree also requires the State to show reasonable doubt about the nature of a person's mental condition and personality disorder before placing him into transitional release, and requires the court to determine whether the person has serious difficulty controlling his or her behavior if transitionally released.  The court's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to remain in the program.  In a parallel action, the Kansas Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action, which seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Kathleen M. Burns of the United States District Court in Kansas issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering the defendant to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requiring him to be permanently enjoined from participating in any type of criminal proceeding. The court also granted the defendant's motion for a hearing and ordered him to show cause and reasonable cause to believe that he has a serious problem controlling his/her behavior. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Kansas Division of Criminal Justice. The litigation will be led by Ms. Burns and Ms. Wilcox. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the Kansas Department of Justice in this matter."
