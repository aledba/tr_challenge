  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Ohio today announced charges against a Cleveland man accused of setting fire to a McDonald's restaurant.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, alleges that John Michailides violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, in August 2016, Michigan Attorney General Mark W. Javorski filed an emergency motion to dismiss the indictment against Michailide, charging him with two counts of aggravated arson, one count of arson, and three counts of inducing panic. The complaint also alleges that Michailites sought a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other emergency relief, including an officer-and-director bar, and a court order prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged misconduct.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in March 2017, the state filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which was denied by the trial court.  On March 9, 2017, a federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, granted the state's motion for an emergency injunction and ordered Michailies to be released from custody. On May 1, the date of the emergency injunction was set for a hearing to determine whether the emergency restraining order should be issued, and the amount of time that will be tolled will be determined by the court upon motion by the defendant. The court also granted the request for a court-ordered expedited hearing.  A hearing scheduled for May 1 was delayed until after counsel was assigned and the case was reviewed by the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-615203.
