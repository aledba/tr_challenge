  "summary": "On March 5, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia entered a preliminary injunction against Phillip Kord Stockwell, a former Vice President of Sales at HPS, for violating the company's non-competition provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that Stockwell violated Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  Stockwell agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $75,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $50,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Stockwell has consented to a permanent injunction, which is subject to the court's order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Texas today announced criminal charges against Stockwell.  On March 6, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action in which it obtained a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order freezing Stockwell's assets.  As part of the emergency action, HPS agreed to pay a $100,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of 24 months following the termination of HPS' employment. Stockwell also agreed to be prohibited from soliciting, recruiting, enticing, or hiring any employee of another company, and from engaging in any activity that would cause any HPS employee to terminate his or her employment with the company or violate any agreement he or she may have with HPS.  HPS has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 13(b)(2) and 14(e) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 14e-3 thereunder, and to pay an $8,500 civil penalty in the amount of $25,000 and a $10,000 officer and director bar, respectively.  A final judgment ordering Stockwell to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest and pay prejudgment interests of $2,065, will bar him from working for any third party other than HPS and from participating in any business or employment that is favorable to his/her employer's interests, and requires him to be restrained and enjoined from using or disclosing confidential or trade secret information to effectuate those services.
