  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, Missouri, alleges that Brian A. Murrin, a resident of Clay County, Kansas, attempted to induce his wife, Alea, to come home from work on August 18, 2014, by telling her that he would have to go home and \"deal with the consequences of my actions.\"  Murrin allegedly told her that his son would come looking for him.  According to the complaint, Murrin replied that he did not want to do anything wrong and that he had personally seen him on the property and knew that he was under arrest for criminal trespass.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Missouri today announced criminal charges against Murrin.  On August 19, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the Court of Appeals issued an order suspending Murrin from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering him to surrender his passport and other documents related to the case.  Judge Burt also ordered Murrin to comply with the court's order suspending him from appearing, practicing, or appearing before the Commission on Civil Litigation.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order halting Murrin's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act and Section 15(a)(2) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13d-1 thereunder, and ordered him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and pay civil penalties in the amount of $5,000, $1,500, and $100,000 in disgorgement and interest, and to appoint a receiver for Murrin and his family.  Finally, the court appointed a receiver to determine whether to issue a civil injunctive relief order against the defendant.  A receiver will be appointed by the court upon motion of the Commission upon its motion. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
