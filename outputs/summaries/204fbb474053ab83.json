  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in favor of a civil injunctive action against the Department of the Interior and Bureau of Land Management in connection with an ongoing FOIA litigation.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 9, 2017, filed in federal district court in Denver, Colorado, Grand Canyon Trust, a non-profit corporation with over 3,500 members, alleged that it was entitled to attorney's fees based on its timely receipt of requests for documents related to the federal government's coal program.  The complaint alleges that, in August 2016, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the United States District Court against the DOI-OS and BLM, alleging that, despite these backlogs, the defendants continued to work to satisfy the plaintiff's requests.  In addition, according to the complaint, in September 2016, shortly after the plaintiff submitted his FOIA request, the DOI\u2013OS and the BLM issued a second partial response of 5,830 pages of documents to the plaintiff.  As alleged, however, the DOJ-OS had not produced any records by the time the complaint was filed, and the agency sent the plaintiff a cease-and-desist letter the same day it requested the documents.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of $68,047.82 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $20,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to determine whether they qualify for an attorney's fee based on their experience and qualifications.  For example, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter, the Office of the Inspector General's Office, the Bureau of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Housing Finance Authority, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York."
