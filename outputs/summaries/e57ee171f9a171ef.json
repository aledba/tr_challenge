  "summary": "On May 17, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against defendant Plante & Moran, PLLC, in a civil action brought by Robert and Kimberly Broz.  The court found that Plante and Moran violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Plante&Moran agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In its order, the court also ordered Plante to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Plante agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act Section 5(b)(5) and (c) and ordering it to disgorge its alleged ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael O'Hara-Bruce, Kelly L. Gibson, and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
