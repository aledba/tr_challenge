  "summary": "On February 11, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a California-based woman who claimed to have been disabled as of December 1, 2011.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York City, Tracie H. was diagnosed with severe impairments related to her physical and mental health.  The complaint alleges that, from 2002 to 2011, she had ten different jobs, holding on to most for no more than a few months.  As alleged in the complaint, plaintiff had several severe disabilities that prevented her from performing sedentary work.  In one instance, the complaint alleges, she was mildly limited in her daily activities and social functioning, and had a history of severe anxiety and depression.  She also had severe lymphedema, which required her to stand for up to six hours in an 8-hour workday.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Office of Inspector General, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Massachusetts Department of Health and Human Services."
