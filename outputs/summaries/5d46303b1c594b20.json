  "summary": "On March 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a temporary restraining order against Texas-based real estate developer Park at Westcreek, LP (Westcreek). The court granted the court's request for an emergency asset freeze and other emergency relief.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, Texas, Park at Eastcreek claimed that it was entitled to a right to use an easement located in part on land owned by the County of Harris County, Texas. The complaint alleges that the County did not waive its governmental immunity from suit by filing an adverse possession claim against the County in 1973, and that, in addition to asserting its own claims for monetary relief, the County also failed to allege an actionable inverse condemnation claim.  The court also denied the County's motion for a preliminary injunction, which would have prevented the County from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against Westcott. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Fort Worth Regional Office and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.
