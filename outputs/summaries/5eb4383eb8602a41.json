  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against George Shrader, Jr., a Florida man charged with two counts of first- and second-degree felony murder, and a third count of sexual battery with a deadly weapon.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Hillsborough County, Florida on January 27, 1986, the defendant was found dead in a pool of his own blood in the middle of a dirt road.  The complaint alleges that the defendant had been stabbed thirty-six times and was wearing only a T-shirt when he discovered the victim lying in the pool of her own blood.  As alleged in the complaint, the victim was not dressed for cold weather and was almost completely nude when she was confronted by two officers with the same question: \"Have you ever had sex with a woman before?\"  The SEC further alleges that, on the morning after the murder, the officer found the victim's body and found her bloodstained shorts and panties under her bed.  He then allegedly cut his hand on a knife while reaching into a dishwasher and was left without bruising, lacerations, or tearing of her orifices.  In a parallel action, the Florida Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an emergency court order halting the case.  On November 9, 2016, the SEC filed an emergency action halting the trial, which was scheduled to begin on November 10, 2016. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Miami Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Criminal Justice. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's Biology and Forensics Division, the FBI, and the Florida Office of Inspector General."
