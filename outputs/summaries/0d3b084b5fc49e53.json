  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Rochester, New York man who was convicted of, among other things, pre-meditated rape in the first degree, and two counts of predatory sexual assault against a child.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that, from at least 2013 through at least 2015, defendant was falsely told at the start of the interview that he was not in custody and would be going home that day.  According to the complaint, however, the court did not read the instructions on the lesser included counts of the indictment, and defendant failed to preserve for our review his contention that the court interfered unnecessarily during the questioning of certain witnesses, thereby depriving him of a fair trial.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant was repeatedly denied access to the court's evidence during the course of the trial, including testimony from an expert who testified for the People regarding the child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome (CSAAS).  The complaint further alleges that defendant was not properly represented to the jury during the hearing, and the court failed to consider the absence of a strategic basis for defense counsel's choice not to again demand an instruction regarding the lesser charges.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  For further information, see People v. Kelly, 84 N.Y.2d 1349, 1351, 1314, 1316, 1317, 1319, 1320, 1321, 1322, 1323, 1324, 1325, 1326, 1327, 1332, 1333, 1334, 1336, 1349 and 1349 in the United States Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General's Criminal Justice Division.  On the same day that the SEC issued its final judgment, the Court granted a temporary restraining order against defendant and ordered him to comply with the court order, ordering him to surrender his passport and to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  It also issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Among other things:  The Court denied defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 10"
