  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Nebraska announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against Kelly R. Rosberg, her husband, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on November 4, 2016, Rosberg alleged that Kelly violated Section 28-311.09 of the federal anti-harassment laws by failing to show sufficient evidence to justify an emergency court order denying Rosberg's request for a harassment protection order against Kelly.  The complaint alleges that Rosberg lied to a probation officer 3 times and had to go to jail for 16 days and pay an attorney $10,000.  Rosberg also allegedly committed perjury by making up a lie that he earned $250,000 per year, which resulted in a sentence of jail time for Rosberg.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Rosberg from future violations of Sections 28-310.09, and orders Rosberg to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 28, 2017, entered a temporary restraining order against Rosberg and ordered her to appear and testify before the court on January 31, 2017.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson, Ms. Gibson, and Mr. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Nebraska Department of Justice, and the Nebraska State Attorney General's Office."
