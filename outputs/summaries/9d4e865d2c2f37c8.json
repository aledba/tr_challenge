  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Lisa and Rod Choate, who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that Lisa, Rod, and their two children, K.C. and I.C., were removed from the Choates' custody in June 2015 and adjudicated dependent-neglected by order entered August 24, 2015. The court subsequently terminated the Choate's parental rights by order in October 2016.  According to the complaint, the court did not have jurisdiction over the children at the time of the termination, and the children were not being reunified with their parents.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the children had regressed and were not demonstrating any parenting skills.  As a result of the court's decision to terminate their parental rights, the children have been placed with their grandparents, who are currently out of the custody of the children.  On January 25, 2018, the Arkansas Court of Appeals held that the court lacked jurisdiction to determine whether to proceed to termination based on the facts presented in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order, the Court held that there was no reasonable basis for terminating the parental rights.  It also held that, in the absence of sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case for termination, the kids should be returned to their parents immediately.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 9-27-341 (Supp. 2017).  The Court granted the Court's request for a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the children's assets, including the right to reapply, to conduct a permanency-planning hearing for the children, and to issue an order appointing an attorney to represent the children in the permanency planning hearing.   The court also granted the family's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2) of The Securities Act of 1933, and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and ordered the children to be placed with the grandparents, without the parents' knowledge or consent, at a later date.  To resolve the issues raised by the court, the defendants agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes a $25,000 civil penalty."
