  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Mississippi-based disability agency that denied her application for disability retirement benefits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that in 2010, Gloria Lang, a corrections officer with the Mississippi Department of Corrections, filed for non-duty-related disability benefits with the Public Employees' Retirement System (PERS). The complaint alleges that the PERS Board of Trustees initially denied Lang's request for disability benefits because she was close to retirement age and could no longer perform the duties of her job. The complaint further alleges that on June 12, 2009, Dr. Philip Blount and Dr. Samuel Peeples reviewed Lang's medical records and concluded that she was not disabled and recommended that she be denied disability benefits based on substantial evidence.  According to the complaint, the Board's findings and recommendation were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Lang arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Lang consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 22, 2008, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Lang and ordered her to return to work on June 24, 2009. The court also issued an order suspending her from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering her to comply with the court's order. The order also prohibits her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of service.  A hearing on June 26, 2009 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mississippi Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
