  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the preservation of Brace Cottage, a historic structure located at 112 Wilson Park Drive, Tarrytown, New York.  According to the court's order, filed on October 27, 2014, the Village Attorney's Office filed an emergency action to halt the pending litigation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, in 2004, Charles C. Brace and his estate Braceholme Mansion was demolished and replaced by a two-story stone house.  As alleged in the complaint, Brace was the only structure in the development area that was eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.  Brace is the only remaining structure that the Planning Board approved in 2004.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's action, the Board of Trustees has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer and director bar.  In a parallel action, on November 8, 2014 the U.N. Office of Economic and Risk Analysis and the Office of Inspector General issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the New York Office of the Secretary of State's Office and the Division of Environmental Education and Science and Health Care.  Among other things, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0On November 10, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans entered a temporary restraining order against further violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the SEC to conduct an examination of its books, records, and records, as well as an order appointing a receiver for Brace's destruction.  On November 13, 2019, the Court issued an order requiring the Commission to consider the merits of the Commission's action against Brace Holme Mansion, ordering it to submit a supplemental Environmental Quality Review (SEQRA) in which it would consider whether to permit the reopening of the site plan application pursuant to the Board's order.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson."
