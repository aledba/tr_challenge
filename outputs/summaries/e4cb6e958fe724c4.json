  "summary": "On June 11, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas entered a final judgment against the Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) in a civil injunctive action brought by the estate of Khyree Martin, a minor, alleging that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of the federal anti-lien laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Pulaski County, Arkansas, alleges that, in a settled administrative proceeding, the state agency in charge of Medicaid paid $1.9 million to a private hospital for the treatment of a severe brain injury at birth for which DHS paid $115,845.62 through Medicaid for medical expenses. The complaint further alleges that the estate settled the case knowing of a lien on the patient's \"property\" and that the amount of the settlement represented the value of the estate's case.  According to the complaint, the court's final judgment, which permanently enjoins DHS from violating the anti-ligacy provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, orders DHS to pay $260,209.99 for past medical expenses paid on behalf of the victim and $1,000,000 for future medical expenses, and orders the payment of a penalty equal to the amount the estate has paid to DHS.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the estate for its role in this matter.  On June 13, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action against the agency, charging it with a violation of the antiligence provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(e) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the agency has agreed to settle the case against the SEC. The settlement is subject to court approval. The court also agreed to the entry of a judgment that imposes a penalty of $'20-77-315(a)(2) and a $'1,500,000 civil penalty. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  A hearing for the estate is scheduled for May 24, 2019.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Ricks of the Atlanta Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by George Prange and supervised by Ms. Martin. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson."
