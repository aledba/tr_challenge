  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against the Peoria County Department of Planning and Zoning for revoking a non-conforming use certificate issued in 1974.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against FLM Enterprises, LLC, a company owned by Steven Maxheimer, Joseph LaHood, and John and Dian Steeg.  According to the court's order, FLM purchased the property for $640,000 in 2007 and made several changes to its plans to develop the 80-acre parcel. The court found that FLM's reliance on the Department's affirmative act was unreasonable because the nonconforming certificate allowed for mining and extraction of sand and gravel on the property. In addition, the court found FLM liable for violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, charges FLM with violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The case is being handled by the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John Birkenheier and Amy Gwiazda of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, with assistance from Eric Werner of the Chicago Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
