  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Wilhite family, agreeing to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $1,741,700.00.  The judgment also orders the Wilhs to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.00, a $1 million penalty, and a $10,000 civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, on December 31, 1997, a federal district court in Manhattan issued a temporary restraining order against the Wilheites, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, pay civil penalties, and pay interest.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Wilhites.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Wilhes consented to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the federal securities laws, ordering a temporary asset freeze, and imposing a penny stock bar against each of them.  On January 2, 2018, the court granted the family\u2019s request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered a hearing to determine whether to proceed with the asset freeze or to issue an order appointing a receiver for AFC.  A hearing scheduled for February 21, 2018 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-11.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U. S. Attorney\u2019S Office for the Northern District of California, and the Colorado Office of Financial Regulation."
