  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment in favor of a St. Louis man who was convicted of first-degree murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on October 2, 2017, the trial court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Appellant.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, the court found that the defendant had a restraining order against him, which required him to show cause and effect, that he had access to tools, implements, or any articles with which the particular crime was or might have been committed, and that a weapon of the same type used to kill Victim was found in the apartment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Judge Mascianica ruled that the jury had the right to determine whether the defendant was guilty or liable based on the evidence presented in the complaint. The court also found that, in the alternative, the defendant did not have a reasonable basis to prove his guilt, and the jury could not determine whether he had committed the crime.  On October 4, 2018, the Honorable Kathleen M. Burns granted the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendant to surrender his passport, which was due to expire on November 5, 2018.  Judge Burns also granted the motion for an expedited hearing on November 8, 2018 and ordered that the court consider the merits of the case before it. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri State Attorney General's Office, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Criminal Division's Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice Criminal Investigations, the Office of the Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, the Division of Enforcement's Criminal Investigations Division, as well as the Missouri Secretary of State's Office.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221, July 17, 2018 (Securities Act, Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 15(b)(2) thereunder).  The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Burns and Ms. Burns."
