  "summary": "On May 2, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Rashan J. Hunt, a convicted felon who was sentenced to a 23-year prison term.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cuyahoga County, Hunt was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Hunt was not aware of the provisions of the federal and state securities laws and that he was improperly sentenced for a repeat violent offender specification.  As alleged in the complaint, Hunt agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In addition, Hunt has agreed to be permanently barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.  Hunt also agreed to a six-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from associating with any third-party law violator.  On July 19, 2020, the court granted Hunt's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  A hearing for Hunt was scheduled for August 21, 2020.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 102371, 2015-Ohio-3349, 2015 WL 4997202.
