  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Michael Owen for illegally manufacturing methamphetamine.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, while riding in a vehicle with a seven-year-old daughter, Owen transported equipment that had been used to manufacture methamphetamine. According to the complaint, the items in Owen's bag contained equipment and chemicals used for the manufacture of methamphetamine, including a one-pot shake bottle. The complaint further alleges that Owen failed to take efforts to safely store the equipment and materials in a bag, and instead used a short-barreled shotgun to cook the methamphetamine. The SEC alleges that when Owen attempted to flee, he dropped the bag and attempted to return to the vehicle, but was intercepted by an officer who was trained in methamphetamine investigations. The court ruled that Owen violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Owen to pay a $250,000 penalty. Owen agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained a final judgment that permanently enjoins Owen from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. In a related administrative proceeding, the Department of Justice today announced a parallel criminal case against Owen. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Gaunt. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for New Jersey, the Federal Criminal Court, and the Ohio State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
