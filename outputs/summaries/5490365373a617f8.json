  "summary": "On March 13, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against the Commission for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that the Commission violated the pre-judgment provision of the federal parole laws by not imposing a one-year set-off.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., on April 13, 2017, the Commission issued an order requiring the Commission to hold annual parole hearings for repeat offenders who had not yet been granted parole.  In its order, the court found that, under the terms of the settlement agreement, the commission had the discretion to impose set-offs of more than one year, even if the offender had committed a serious disciplinary violation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's order, however, the Court held that it had improperly relied on the evidence presented in its order to determine whether to impose a five-year minimum sentence for those convicted of the same offenses.  It also ruled that, as alleged in the complaint, there was no reasonable basis for imposing such a long-term minimum sentence when the Commission did not impose such a time-frame as it did under the 1972 Guidelines.  Further, it ruled that there was insufficient evidence to support a reasonable determination of whether the Commission exceeded its discretion in imposing the mandatory minimum sentence, and that it should not have delayed issuing the mandatory two-year mandatory minimum.  Finally, on May 13, the SEC filed an amended complaint, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Evans and Ms. Basinger. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, and the Federal Office of Inspector General.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Feb. 13, 2019).  The SEC thanks the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for its assistance in this matter, including in its investigation of the securities fraud and other related matters."
