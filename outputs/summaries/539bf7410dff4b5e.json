  "summary": "On September 5, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that, in the five years preceding this case, defendant was convicted of multiple counts of second-degree animal neglect involving dogs and miniature horses. The complaint further alleges that defendant was indicted for unlawfully possessing 11 miniature horses, \u201cmultiple cats,\u201d and a dog. The court found defendant guilty of 13 counts of unlawful possession of an animal for five years following entry of the conviction, and entered 13 separate guilty verdicts for the same animal.  According to the complaint, the court did not err when it entered a number of separate convictions for the animal's violations.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant failed to grapple with the fact that the legislature intended for each animal to be a separate victim of the crime, justifying separate convictions.  As a result of the court's decision, the SEC's investigation was conducted by Karen Haberle, and the litigation will be led by Lee Bartholomew. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oregon Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, and other emergency relief agencies."
