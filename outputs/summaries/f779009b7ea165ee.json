  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a New York City Police Department officer who was injured while loading wooden police barriers onto a truck.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, Allison Gammons was injured during the course of loading a police truck onto the truck. The complaint alleges that on the date of her injury, defendant Police Department, nevertheless, had available newer trucks that were sufficiently long to accommodate the full length of the barriers without any portion hanging off the back, and could hold two officers.  The complaint further alleges that defendants failed to establish the existence of a \"recognized hazard\" within the meaning of the law, because plaintiff claimed her injury was due to the improper use of the truck, rather than the safety and health of her employees.  As alleged in the complaint, the truck was too short and lacked the proper railings for the task of barrier loading, and the back was left open and unprotected, and only one officer could comfortably fit on the truck during the loading process.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the officers involved in the alleged misconduct. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the New York Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Criminal Investigations. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the U.N. Office of the Inspector General."
