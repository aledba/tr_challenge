  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today issued a final judgment in favor of Utah State University, Utah, and Utah-based entities in the Immunity Act of 1940.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Utah, alleges that the Utah legislature violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to provide sufficient information about the nature and scope of the exemption provisions.  According to the complaint, the SEC's order, which was issued on May 24, 1940, and unsealed on May 25, 1940 and unseated on May 26, 1940 respectively, provided that the SEC had the authority to determine whether Utah State was an instrumentality of the state under the federal Immunity Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Utah State and Utah State have agreed to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions and ordering them to be permanently enjoined from violating the federal laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Utah today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Utah State, Utah Farm Bureau, Utah Secretary of State, Salt Lake City, Utah Department of Justice, Utah Division of Criminal Justice, and Salt Lake County District Attorney General. The SEC also issued an order requiring Utah State to provide an accounting of the amount of money it has paid to Utah State in connection with the purchase of a home, automobile, or other home, and to provide a copy of the final judgment for Utah State.  On May 31, 2020, the court granted Utah State's request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against future violations, which is subject to court approval. The court granted the request for an injunction and ordered Utah to comply with the court order. Utah State has agreed to a settlement where it will determine whether it is entitled to a permanent injunction and to pay a civil penalty. The settlement is pending approval by the court.  Utah State also agreed to an order appointing a receiver to oversee the issuance of the emergency relief letters.  For further information, see Salt Lake State v. Utah, 2017 UT 564 P.3d; Utah State Securities Commission v. Salt Lake, 2018 UT 569 P.2d; and Utah Securities Commissions v.
