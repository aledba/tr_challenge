The court entered the final judgment in Ashford\u2019s favor, ordering the suspension of educational assistance payments to Ashford, and ordering Ashford to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000.  Ashford has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 511(a) and 513(b)(2)(A).
