  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Gregory J. Smith of Pleasant Valley, Calif., for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that Smith violated the right of meaningful access to the courts by failing to disclose to a trial court that he was unable to adequately represent himself because of his incarceration, lack of education and training, and difficulty in obtaining an expert witness.  According to the complaint, Smith also failed to disclose that the trial court had the discretionary authority to appoint counsel for indigent defendants.  In addition, the complaint alleges Smith failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his claim that he had been denied meaningful access.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Smith consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $1,330.13 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  Smith also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and ordered to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  On May 27, 2017, the court granted Smith's motion for summary judgment and ordered him to comply with the court's order, which requires him to show cause and effect, including that he has met his duty to provide reasonable and competent medical care, by filing a motion for appointment of counsel in the form of a civil action and submitting a written response to a court order denying Smith's request to be appointed counsel for an indigent, self-represented defendant.   The court also granted Smith a temporary restraining order prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of securities in the securities of any public company, including publicly traded publicly traded companies.
