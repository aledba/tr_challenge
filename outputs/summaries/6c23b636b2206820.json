  "summary": "On April 4, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against a former officer of the Pontiac Police Pension Fund who was injured while performing a bicycle-patrol training exercise.  The court's order, which was entered on May 4, 2016, permanently enjoins the officer from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the court also granted the officer's request for a \"line-of-duty\" disability pension.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, Shawna Gilliam, a former Pontiac police officer, participated in a training program taught by Charlie Summers, an International Police Mountain Bike Association instructor. The complaint alleges that, while performing the training, Gilliam fell onto her right arm and wrist and was injured. The court also ruled that Gilliam was not entitled to line-of duty disability benefits because she did not perform the training in the capacity of a police officer.  Gilliam's case was handled by the Chicago Regional Office, Chief James Woolford, and the Chief of Police's Pension Fund. The SEC's case is being handled by John Rymas, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Assistant Director of the Chicago Division of Banking and Securities. The litigation will be led by Mr. Wadley. The case has been supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the Illinois State Department of Health and Human Services, the Michigan Department of Education, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan, the Minnesota Department of Commerce, the Missouri Department of Business and Insurance, as well as the Illinois Secretary of State's Office.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5/5/113 (January 2014).
