  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against Rebecca Hites for her role in a January 31, 2014 automobile accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that Hites violated the \"sudden emergency\" doctrine, which requires a jury to determine whether or not a person is at fault for a sudden emergency.  According to the complaint, Hites, who lives in Shipshewana, received a phone call from her friend, Dave Smith, who asked her if she would pick him up because his car had broken down on County Road 43. Hites allegedly lost control of her vehicle, causing her vehicle to swerve across the centerline of the roadway and strike Yates' eastbound vehicle. The complaint further alleges that, after reviewing the evidence presented by Hites's attorney, Trooper Marc Leatherman of the Indiana State Police, the jury found Hites not at fault because she did not cause the emergency. The court also ruled that, following his investigation, he concluded that the driver had been driving at a speed too fast for the existing weather conditions that day.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court also granted Hites a temporary restraining order, which prohibits her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Hites to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hites.  On September 12, 2017, the trial court granted Yates's motion in limine for a new trial, granted her motion for a preliminary injunction, and granted her request for a conduct-based injunction against further violations of the \"jurisdictional\" provisions of the federal securities laws.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for October 5, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 17-cv-01, Litigation Action No. 13-14-2017.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Indiana Department of Insurance, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
