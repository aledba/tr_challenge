  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in a case brought by Mercy Hospital.  The court found that the agency violated the federal securities laws by failing to properly review the reimbursement rates of hospitals that provide inpatient rehabilitation services.  According to the court's order, the agency failed to comply with the federal law requiring it to determine the number of patients eligible for Medicare reimbursements.  Mercy Hospital's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, in 2001, the federal government issued an order requiring CMS to determine a prospective payment rate for rehabilitation facilities that provided inpatient rehabilitative services, called \"prospective payment rates.\"  The complaint further alleges that in 2004, when CMS issued its recommendation to the agency, it failed to consider the need for review.  In its complaint, the court also ordered the agency to create a \"preclusion paragraph\" that includes a provision that prohibits the agency from reviewing a hospital's response to a challenge to a CMS reimbursement decision.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Mercy Hospital agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the federal bar and ordering it to conduct a conduct-based review of the reimbursement rate. The judgment also ordered Mercy Hospital to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $50,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The court also granted the hospital's request for a temporary restraining order, which requires it to provide a copy of the complaint to the SEC. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Antonin Scalia and Bryan Garner. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
