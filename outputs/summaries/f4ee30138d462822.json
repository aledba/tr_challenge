  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for unlawfully withholding documents related to the discontinuation of advertising for healthcare.gov, the federal health insurance marketplace, during the final weeks of the 2016-17 open enrollment period.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that the Department unlawfully withheld documents from the agency in violation of the deliberative process privilege.  According to the complaint, the Department's redacted materials were sent to the agency's Office of Public Affairs and/or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, HHS and CMS consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and order HHS to comply with the Commission's order.  HHS also agreed to pay $1.2 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  CMS agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the issuance of a cease-and-desist order, which prohibits it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and to pay a $1,500 civil penalty to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against HHS, CMS, and HHS for violating Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 15a-3 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a preliminary injunction, an order to freeze the assets of the agency, and an order requiring the agency to provide an accounting of the assets and liabilities of each of the entities involved in the alleged violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder; an order appointing a receiver for the agency; and a court order requiring that the agency comply with a subpoena pursuant to Rule 15e-3.  Among other things, the SEC is requesting that the court issue an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering the SEC to provide a copy of the requested documents to the court.  Finally, the Commission is seeking an order ordering the Department to produce and preserve the documents that it has withheld from the public as part of an ongoing investigation.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office."
