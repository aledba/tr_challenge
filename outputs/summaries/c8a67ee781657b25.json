  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Clayton Thornburg, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 336 months in prison for engaging in child pornography.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Thornburg violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder.  According to the complaint, Thornburg used a fictitious online identity to lure a 13-year-old girl to engage in a sex act with him.  Thornburg allegedly told the girl that he would teach her how to perform oral sex and promised her gifts.  As alleged, however, the complaint alleges that the girl did not like the idea of Thornburg engaging in oral sex, and that he did not want to be the \"daddy\" behind the scenes.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has issued an order suspending Thornburg from appearing or practicing before the Commission on Child Abuse, and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar on Thornburg.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Steven G. Bentsen of the Federal District Court in Jackson granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order against Thornburg and ordered him to return to the United States and pay a civil penalty of 336 months.
