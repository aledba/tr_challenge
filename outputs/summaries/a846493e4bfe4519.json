  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Aaron S. of Santa Clara County, California, finding that he failed to participate in a transitional independent living program.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, Aaron was placed in a group home and placed in the care of a state agency that provides independent living programs.  The complaint alleges that Aaron was not participating in the program when he was deemed eligible because he had not completed school or had a driver's license.  As alleged in the complaint, Aaron also failed to meet certain requirements of the program, including completing a placement test and meeting with an academic counselor in order to meet those requirements.  In addition, Aaron allegedly failed to show any interest in attending college or having a job, despite repeated attempts to do so.  Finally, the complaint alleges, Aaron failed to comply with a court order requiring him to sign a 90-day transition plan, which requires the court to determine whether to terminate dependency jurisdiction over a nonminor dependent at a later date.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Aaron consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Aaron also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Nadia G. and Glenn S. Gordon of the San Francisco Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Ms. G. Gordon and Ms. Gordon. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Children and Families, and the California Office of Inspector General."
