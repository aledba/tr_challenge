  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against MaineGeneral Health, Inc., a health insurance company, and Melissa True, an employee of MaineGeneral, for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that, in August 2014, Melissa True entered into a \"Gestational Carrier Agreement\" with intended parents, Anxo Cereijo Roibas and Szczepan Wojciech, in which she agreed to submit claims for all pregnancy-related medical expenses, including expenses related to a surrogate mother's pregnancy and childbirth.  According to the complaint, True was informed on that call that there was no exclusion, but the expenses of a pregnancy that results when a plan participant serves as a surrogate were not covered by the Plan.  In addition, the complaint alleges that True initially received benefits for some of her pregnancy expenses only to find out later that her claims were denied because she was not an active member on the date that she called.

On May 4, 2017, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered MaineGeneral to comply with the court's order.
