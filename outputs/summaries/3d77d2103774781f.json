  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment in favor of the city of Jackson in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that on July 2, 2015, Ben Allen, then President of Downtown Jackson Partners, Inc., filed a bill of exceptions with the court for the purpose of approving the rezoning of an approximately.3 acre parcel of property in Jackson.  According to the complaint, Allen failed to file the bill as required by the federal law because he did not have standing as a member of the board of supervisors.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Allen arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  As alleged, Allen also failed to comply with the requirements of the federal securities laws, including the requirement that a judge sign the bill before he or she makes an order appointing an attorney to review the matter.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Allen consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000 and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Allen also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to pay a $20,000 civil penalty.  On August 25, 2016, the court granted the City of Jackson's request for a temporary restraining order against Allen and ordered him to file an amended bill of exception, which is subject to court approval.  At the same time, on September 4, 2017, the SEC issued an order suspending Allen from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney in the case of Jackson County Board of Supervisors v. City of Indianola, 904 So.2d 559 (Miss. 1974).  The court's order temporarily enjoined Allen from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any such order.  It also ordered Allen to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court on August 26, 2016.    The Court's order also ordered the city to provide an accounting of the number of people who have filed applications to appeal the city's decision to rezone the property, including those who have not yet filed applications. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. McCole and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. "
