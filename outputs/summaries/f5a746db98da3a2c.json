  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Kentucky today announced criminal charges against a former member of the motorcycle gang the Iron Horsemen.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky, alleges that Matthew Shaffer violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Shaffer, who lives in Walton, Kentucky, engaged in two separate drug-trafficking schemes. The first scheme involved Shaffer's involvement with a motorcycle gang and drug trafficking, and the SEC alleges that Shaffer used a confidential informant to carry out the scheme. Shaffer also alleges that the SEC improperly admitted the existence of a gun in Shaffer\u2019s home, despite the fact that the informant had previously provided corroborating testimony to the SEC. The SEC also found no evidence of Shaffer being a drug trafficker or a member of a drug trafficking organization.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Shaffer that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $8,920.00, prejudgment interest in the amount of his penalty, and imposes a civil penalty of 420 months. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Shaffer to comply with the court's order. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Kentucky Office of Inspector General in this matter."
