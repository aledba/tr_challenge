  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Louisiana mother for her role in a domestic violence case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Renee Forgason, a child protection case worker employed by the Department of Children and Family Services, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, A.F. was placed in the custody of DCFS on April 4, 2017, after receiving a report of suspected abuse and neglect of a child in need of care. The complaint alleges that from the inception of her case plan until the termination trial, she made virtually no progress in fulfilling the case plan requirements.  In the instant case, the trial court declined to adjudicate the child as a potential parent as to the father.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay $5,000 in child support, and requires her to participate in substance abuse support groups and attend anger management counseling. The court also ordered her to comply with a court order requiring her to provide for the child's well-being, including providing for a safe and stable home for her child.  On August 13, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, alleging that the District Court improperly granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, ordered her return to Louisiana, and issued an order suspending her from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  A hearing scheduled for September 5, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.
