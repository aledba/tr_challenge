  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Sherrick A. Sims, a convicted felon who was sentenced to life in prison for premeditated first-degree murder and criminal possession of a firearm in 2013.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on June 9, 2013, Sims and his girlfriend, Kimberly Carrillo, attended a family gathering at their home in Wyandotte County, N.Y.  The complaint alleges that Sims and Carrillo confronted Sims about his prior felony conviction and asked him to consider the lesser-included offense of second-degree intentional murder.  Sims agreed to settle the case by agreeing to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Sims consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Sims arising from the same conduct alleged by Carrillo.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and Carol S. Cotter of the New York Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Division of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kansas Attorney General's Office in this matter."
