  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against defendant Douglas Perham, Jr. of Chaves County, N.M.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that Perham used FrostWire, a peer-to-peer, file-sharing network, to access child pornography.  According to the complaint, Perham was familiar with known child pornography search terms, and was able to locate videos that were located on his computer.  Perham also allegedly used LimeWire and FrostWire to search for child pornography, which is commonly referred to as \"child pornography.\"  The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico announced criminal charges against Perham.  On May 25, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering Perham to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 30-6A-3(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  In a parallel administrative proceeding, the U. S. Attorney\u2019S Office for the Middle District of Nevada today announced criminal prosecutions against Perram.
