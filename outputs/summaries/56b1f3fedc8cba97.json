  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against Kentucky's first-ever permanent injunction against the imposition of a mandatory delay in the adjudication of common-law personal-injury claims.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson County, Kentucky, the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office and the Kentucky Attorney General's Office issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order on the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any medical-malpractice-related complaint.  The SEC alleges that, in violation of Section 14 of the Kentucky Constitution, Kentucky law prohibits the issuance of medical-practice or other medical-related claims without a court order.  In addition, the court found that the right to immediate access to the courts was a prerogative of the legislature, not an independent right.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Kentucky's attorney general has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining the state from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 14 and 15 of the federal securities laws, and to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The SEC's order also prohibits Kentucky's Attorney General from imposing a delay in issuing a judgment imposing a permanent injunction, imposing a $500,000 civil penalty, and imposing an officer-and-director bar on Kentucky law enforcement. The court's order, which is subject to court approval, reserves the issue of an injunction for further determination by the court upon motion of the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  This case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
