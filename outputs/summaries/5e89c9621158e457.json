The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Portland, Maine, alleges that Mahdi Irobe and Suuqa Bakaro Grocery, LLC, a Lewiston, Maine grocery store, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 2023 of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Irobe allegedly engaged in a pattern of transactions that, in its view, evinced trafficking and permanently disqualified the store from participating in the federal program.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Store engaged in 205 high-dollar transactions, that is, transactions ranging from $174 to $1,050, during the four-month period from July through October 2015.

Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Department of Health and Human Services today announced that it has obtained a court order requiring it to order a temporary restraining order against certain of Irobe's alleged violations of the anti-trafficking provisions of the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) Rules of Practice, including Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a) thereunder.  This order requires the store to provide a copy of the FTC's order to"
