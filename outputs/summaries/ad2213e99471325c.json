  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Wells Fargo & Co. and Tauren Exploration, Inc. for breach of the obligations of the mineral lease.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Wells Fargo violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it is liable as an \"owner\" under Section 15 of the lease for violations of Section 15.  According to the complaint, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $125,000 in additional attorney fees for work done on the lease, which is equal to the amount of unpaid royalties owed to the lease owner.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against the defendants.

Investors.gov/Investor.aspx.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Patrick S. Ottinger and Glenn S. Gordon of the New York Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, and the case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
