  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York today entered summary judgment against a Vermont landlord and a social guest of a tenant in a dog-bite case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 15, 2016, Antonio Flores, a resident of Fair Haven, New York, and his wife, Elizabeth Turner, of Vermont, entered into a lease with William and Charity Pearo, a New York-based breed of pit bull, without knowing or having reason to know that the Pearos' dogs posed an unreasonable risk to the public.  The complaint alleges that, at the time of entering the lease, Turner was aware of the dogs' aggressive tendencies, had never personally observed them, and did not know whether they were likely to attack other dogs or humans.  Turner agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Turner consented to a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordering Turner to pay a civil monetary penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint\u00c2\u00a0On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Turner and Turner, charging her with violating Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-2 thereunder.
