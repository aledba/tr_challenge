  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against GAA Classic Cars, LLC, a North Carolina-based car-related company, for defrauding Illinois residents in connection with the sale of an automobile at an auction livestreamed over the Internet from North Carolina.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that, on January 25, 2018, John Dixon saw an advertisement on an online auction website for a 1973 Ford Bronco for sale at auction. The advertisement included a quote about the condition of the Bronco, which Dixon immediately recognized was false. The complaint further alleges that GAA's e-mails and phone calls told Dixon that he should participate in the auction by simply signing a contract and sending it to a mechanic \"well-versed in the repair, building, and restoration of 1973 Ford Broncos.\"  The complaint also alleges that in one e-mail to Dixon, GAA told him he could participate \"via live simulcast bidding or on the telephone via phone bidding\" if he wanted.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against Dixon arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Dixon, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On March 2, 2019, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Dixon. The court also issued an order suspending the registration of GAA, and ordering GAA to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The order also prohibits GAA from making materially false or misleading statements to Illinois residents.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.5 million, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2018)."
