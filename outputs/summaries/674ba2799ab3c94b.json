  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment in favor of a worker's request to reopen her industrial injury claim.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 9, 2007, Tera Hendrickson suffered a severe spinal injury while working as a truck driver. The complaint alleges that Hendrickson experienced pain in her head, neck, mid-back, and low back when she stepped out of a truck at work. The SEC alleges that Dr. Michael Martin, an orthopedic spine surgeon at the Department of Labor and Industries, examined Hendrickson and found that her condition worsened since the department closed her claim in 2012.  The complaint further alleges that when he saw Hendrickson on April 16, 2012, just before the claim was closed, she complained that she had ongoing pain all over.  As alleged in the complaint, during periods of acute attack, Wilber was \"totally disabled\" but did not show any signs of worsening since the final closure of the claim. In 2014, the Department closed the claim with a permanent partial disability award for a condition proximately caused by a ruptured ruptured intervertebral disc.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hendrickson.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Hendrickson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson, Ms. Hendrickson, and Mr. Kresoya. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
