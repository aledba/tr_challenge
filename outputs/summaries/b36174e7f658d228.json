  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of BTA, a Virginia-based real estate company, against the Commissioner of Highways for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that BTA violated the federal securities laws by failing to comply with certain of the provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint also alleges that the Commissioner violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and that the Commission violated Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  BTA's complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Virginia today announced criminal charges against BTA.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on April 5, 2018, BTA and the Commissioner agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal statutes, and order BTA to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, BETA has agreed to the issuance of a final Judgment, which permanently enjoins BTA from future violations of the federal laws, and orders it to pay an $80,000 civil penalty. The Commission has also agreed to a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  On May 9, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court in Alexandria against the County Defendants, charging BTA with violations of Section 12(b).  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia Secretary of State's Office, and the Virginia Attorney General's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2017."
