  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida yesterday entered a final judgment against a Florida man who was convicted of premeditated murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that, on February 6, 2001, Paul \"Big Tony\" Moscatiello, a convicted felon who had become successful as the owner of Miami Subs sandwich shops before founding SunCruz Casinos, a fleet of gambling casino boats, told a co-defendant that he was going to kidnap Gus Boulis, kill him, and bury his body on a farm where he would not be found for years.  According to the complaint, the complaint further alleges that Mosciello and Ferrari were hired to protect him from the two men who had been charged with the same crime.  Moscatiquello allegedly told the victim that he had a new nickname, \"SunCruz Kid,\" and that he would use a \"paintbrush\" to show conflicts and contradictions in the evidence.  In a parallel action, the Florida Attorney General's Office today announced that it has obtained a court order halting the asset freeze and freezing the assets of all defendants in the case.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of New York entered a judgment against Moscatinello, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Moscaticello consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar.   The court also granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and a temporary asset freeze, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael R. Franqui of the Miami Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Banking and Securities and Investments in this matter."
