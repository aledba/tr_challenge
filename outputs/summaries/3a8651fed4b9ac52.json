  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama today entered a final judgment against Tomlin Construction, LLC and its employee, Stuart McQuaid Campbell, Jr., in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on June 17, 2010, at approximately 2:30 p.m., Kennedy, accompanied by four passengers, crossed the double-yellow line in an attempt to pass a 2007 Caterpillar motor grader belonging to Tomlin construction and being operated by Campbell; the accident occurred in a construction zone. According to the complaint, as a result of the accident, Kennedy was unable to stand for long periods of time and had problems with his right leg. The complaint also alleges that Campbell, Tomlin, and Campbell violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Campbell and Tomlin violated the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Campbell and his company.  On May 2, 2019, the SEC filed a settled administrative proceeding against Campbell. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, and entered a default judgment against the defendants. The final judgment permanently enjoins the defendants from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgements of $3,000,000 plus prejudgment interests of $77,111.25 and a civil penalty of $2,500,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 24, 2019).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit, and John Rymas, Regional Director of the Alabama Office of Investor Education and Advocacy.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Department of Insurance, and the Alabama Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
