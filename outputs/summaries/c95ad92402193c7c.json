  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a temporary restraining order against Branden Holena from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Holena used the internet to try to entice a fourteen-year-old boy into having sex. The complaint alleges that, as a condition of his supervised release from prison, Holena was forbidden to use the internet without his probation officer\u2019s approval, and he had to submit to regular searches of his computer and home. In addition, the complaint alleges, Holenna was forbidden from using any computer or internet with his probation officers\u2019 prior approval. The SEC also alleges that the court improperly imposed a lifetime internet ban on Holena, which is unreasonable because it is tailored to the specific needs of the defendant.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against Holena.  According to the SEC, Holen violated the antigay provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-6 thereunder, and Section 15(b)(5) the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder; Section 17 (a) the Securities Act of 1933; and Section 16(a)(1) the Advisers Advisers Rule of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Court has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 10 years. The court has also agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 3583, the federal anti-fraud rule, and to order Holena to comply with a court order requiring him to surrender his passport and other documents. The order also requires him to provide a copy of his criminal history, including a history of his prior criminal convictions, and that he will be barred from using the internet. The Court has also ordered him to cooperate with the FBI in its investigation of child sexual abuse. The case is being handled by Eric R. Birkenheier of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Timothy J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of South Carolina, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
