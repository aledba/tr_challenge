  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Forney Industries, Inc., a Florida-based company, for age discrimination, disability discrimination, and retaliation under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1940.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, charges Forney with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Forney has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending Forney from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert in age and disability discrimination.  According to the SEC, Forney agreed to a settlement that permanently restrains the company from violating these provisions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Reed agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to a five-year officer-director bar. The court also granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, which requires Forney to provide a copy of the complaint to a court-appointed receiver.  On August 17, 2015, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Reed, charging him with violations of Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2)(A) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Forney and Forney's violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and (4) of Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder of the Commission on Administrative Rules. The complaint also seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  A hearing is scheduled for October 13, 2019.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office and supervised by Eric Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Compliance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Health and Human Services."
