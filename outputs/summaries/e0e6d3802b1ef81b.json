  "summary": "On November 17, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against defendant Jay Edwin \"Jay\" Appellant, Jr. of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, ordering him to comply with the mandatory registration and reporting requirements of the Pennsylvania Department of Justice.  The court's order, which was entered on December 20, 2012, requires defendants to register as a Tier III sexual offender by the time they are sentenced.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Philadelphia on September 17, 2016, Appellants, then 16 years of age, was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder, and the registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The court also imposed a penalty of $1,206.76, which is substantially higher than the penalty imposed by the state at the time he committed the alleged crimes.  Appelant has agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed an emergency action to halt the pending litigation.
