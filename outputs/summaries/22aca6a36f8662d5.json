  "summary": "The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) today announced that it has agreed to settle a civil action brought by James Kaufman, a Wisconsin resident, alleging that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that, in 2014, a federal district court in Wisconsin denied Kaufman\u2019s request to relinquish his citizenship under the domestic-renunciation provision of Section 1481(a)(5).  According to the complaint, Kaufman had spent several thousand dollars researching and researching the subject of the provision and had not secured a visa. The complaint further alleges that Kaufman had not obtained a visa and had no credible plans to leave the country after renouncing his citizenship.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney General and Secretaries of State today announced criminal charges against Kaufman. The SEC also announced that Kaufman would be barred from serving as an officer or director of an agency that administers the domestic renunciation provision.  To learn more about repatriating and repatriating, see Litigation Release No. 1481 (a)(6).  The complaint also alleges that USCIS failed to adequately assess Kaufman's likelihood of relinquishing his citizenship when he sought to do so, and failed to inform Kaufman of USCIS's obligations under the federal law.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Kaufman consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and requires him to surrender his passport. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Judgment No. 12-20, No. 1371 (D.C. Cir. 1999), No. 17-cv-01 (Washington, D.C., June 20, 2006).  In addition, the court granted Kaufman a temporary restraining order and ordered him to comply with the entry-of-an-exit order.  A hearing for Kaufman is scheduled for July 21, 2013.  On July 24, 2013, the Honorable Judge William J. Donnelly granted Kaufman's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering him to return to his home country of Wisconsin, and ordering a hearing on July 26, 2013 to determine whether to proceed with the repatriation of his citizenship and whether to issue a civil injunctive relief order. The hearing will be led by Judge Donnelly and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Glenn S. Gordon of the Chicago Regional Office."
