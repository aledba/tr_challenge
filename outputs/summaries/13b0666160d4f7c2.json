  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that, on 11 September 2012, a jury found that defendant A.M.D. of Ruby Falls, Georgia, had engaged in sexual conduct with a child under thirteen years of age when he was incarcerated in Georgia.  According to the complaint, defendant told the jury that defendant had touched the outside and inside of her vagina with his fingers on numerous occasions at the Ruby Falls house, including on the couch in the living room while the family was watching television, on the bed in the basement while her siblings were playing videogames in the same room, and in her own room while defendant read her a book.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant told his mother that he had \"hurted\" her and gestured toward her genitals when she confronted him about it.  He also allegedly told her that she only saw defendant's penis once when she went into the basement to wake him up, and that he did not \"stick a stick inside\" of her.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.00, a $500,000 civil penalty, and a $10,000,000 penalty for a year and a half.   The court also granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits defendants from making materially false or misleading statements to the court, and ordered the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the allegations in the complaint.  Finally, the court issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, which is subject to court approval.  On June 5, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and an officer-and-director bar against the receiver.  A hearing scheduled for July 21, 2020, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. EST. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for North Carolina and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
