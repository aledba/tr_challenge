  "summary": "The United Electrical, Radio & Machine Workers of America (UE) today filed a civil injunctive action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Iowa against the state of Iowa and the federal agency that administers collective bargaining.  The complaint alleges that the Iowa Department of Labor (DOL) and the Iowa Public Employment Relations Board (IPRA) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 20(a) of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, in 2010, the state passed a law requiring public employers and certified bargaining representatives to bargain in good faith with an arbitrator over the minimum wage or wage that each employee would receive under the current collective bargaining agreement.  In addition, the 2017 amendments prohibited the arbitrator from including seniority-based wages in the mandatory bargaining list for bargaining units containing less than thirty percent of public safety employees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, UE and IPRA have agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 17, 2018, the Iowa Board of Regents issued a declaratory order against PERB, ordering it to determine whether to issue an order imposing a preliminary injunction, imposing a $75,000 civil penalty, and imposing an officer-and-director bar. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Iowa Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
