  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Washington announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against the Department of Public Health and Human Services, Child and Family Services, and the birthfather of a fourth Indian child.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cascade County, Washington, alleges that, from at least March 2018 through the first and second termination hearings of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), the Department engaged in active efforts to prevent the breakup of Child\u2019s family.  According to the complaint, however, the Department failed to provide sufficient evidence to support its claims that the child was an Indian child and that it failed to engage with the child and complete its treatment plan.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Department did not provide sufficient information to determine whether the child had a history of drug use and failed to inform the child's parents about his progress.   The complaint further alleges that Father failed to participate in any of the activities required by the ICWA, including providing a sink or swim letter to a birth father who had failed to complete his treatment plan, signing releases, or providing a driver's license.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Father consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar from serving as an officer or director of a public agency.  On February 9, 2019, the District Court entered a temporary restraining order against Father, ordering him to comply with the court order, and appointing a receiver to oversee the placement of the child. The court also ordered Father to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and ordered him to be barred from participating in any child-custody proceeding. The order also prohibits Father from associating with anyone other than his birth father, and prohibits him from providing or providing services to any child under the age of 18. The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, as well as an order requiring the Department to provide an accounting of the number of children removed from the family, including children, in its custody. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection of Abuse and Risk Analysis, with the assistance of the Division of Enforcement's Office of Child Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy S. Cotter."
