  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment in favor of Texas-based liquor retailer Allstate, Inc. and three of its subsidiaries in a civil injunctive action brought by the Texas Attorney General's Office.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas on August 15, 2019, Allstate and Ford Motor Co. (collectively, the \u201cTPSA\u201d) raised the bar on Texas\u2019 prohibition on the sale of liquor in the state.  The complaint alleges that the TPSA violated the antifraud provisions of Section 22.16 of the Texas Liquor Control Act of 1940 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its judgment, the court found that Texas violated the dormant Commerce Clause of the federal securities laws.  Allstate agreed with the court\u2019s finding that the public corporation ban imposes a substantial burden on interstate commerce because it prohibits certain out-of-state companies from obtaining P permits.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, allstate, Ford, and Allstate consented to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the dormant commerce clause and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.  Ford consented, in a parallel action, to a judgment that permanently bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any liquor product in the United States, and from serving as an officer or director of a public company for at least five years.  For further information, see Allstate v. Texas, 495 F.3d at 527, (Dec. 2015).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Commerce, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
