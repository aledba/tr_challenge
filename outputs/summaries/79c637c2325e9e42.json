  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment in favor of the Maryland Attorney General's Office's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Annapolis, Maryland, alleges that, on November 2, 2017, Judge Charles E. Moylan, Jr., of Baltimore, MD, issued an order requiring the trial court to ask the jury properly-phrased \u201cstrong feelings\u201d questions during voir dire.  According to the complaint, the court asked the jury whether any of the prospective jurors had strong feelings about the criminal charges and whether they had ever been the victim of a burglary or theft. The court did not ask the question in compound form. Rather, the complaint alleges that the jury responded to the \"strong feelings\" questions by simply asking the compound questions, which were designed to elicit any potential bias based on the nature of the crime with which the defendant was charged.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Maryland today announced criminal charges against Collins.  On November 4, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendant, charging him with violating Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2)(A) and (3)(B)(3) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Collins from participating in any future conduct of the same nature as the criminal case.  To learn more about jury selection, see Litigation Release No. 559-60, 355 A.3d at 925-26.  A hearing on November 7, 2018 was scheduled for 11:39 a.m. for the SEC to consider the merits of the case against Collins, including whether any member of the jury had experienced or experienced burglary and theft, whether there had been any type of theft, and whether there was any reasonable basis for a fair and impartial jury selection. The hearing is scheduled for 12:30 p.m., and the case is being supervised by"
