  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Michigan man who was sentenced to 57 months in prison for threatening a government official.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Kenneth Nickerson, a former federal employee, made a series of threatening statements on June 5, 2017, including:  \"You will give me the money or there will be issues here,\" and \"I\u2019ll see you in the parking lot, [expletive] to death.\"  The complaint also alleges that Nickerson used a knife to threaten the official, telling the officer that he could not carry out the threat due to a stroke he had suffered in 2011 and that adding an enhancement based on his physical limitations would not amount to double counting.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, despite being banned from the SSA office, Nickerson continued to threaten to harm the official with a knife.  According to the complaint, the court ultimately agreed not to impose the six-level enhancement, which is required by the federal sentencing guidelines, and instead ordered Nickerson to pay a penalty of $75,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $7,500 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a $1,500 civil penalty.  Nickerson also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On November 1, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Nickerson for violating the federal securities laws, and the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and a bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service in violation of the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (b)(4).  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney General announced today that it would conduct a parallel criminal investigation and conduct a hearing on the matter.  To learn more about this matter, see Press Release No. 572, 575 (6th Cir. 2006).  The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigational Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage people to check the background of anyone who makes a threat by using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2"
