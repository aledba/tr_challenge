  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against a former law professor who claimed that he was unfairly denied tenure because of his race.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., on October 2, 2014, Kemit Mawakana, a former associate professor at the David A. Clarke School of Law, was denied tenure in 2014.  The SEC alleges that, based on his race, he was not entitled to special deference because he was a university employee.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the university had a duty to provide feedback and an annual review of a faculty member who had sued the university under Title VII.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the university failed to timely notify him of concerns regarding his scholarship, and that, by failing to do so, he had caused the university to delay its decision to deny him tenure.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the University has agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 1, 2013, the court held that the University was entitled to a reasonable jury to determine whether a university violated the First Amendment by denying a student his tenure because he had \"made [an] effort to clean her house.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed criminal charges against the University of Pennsylvania for its role in the alleged violations of the federal securities laws.  Among other things, the SEC previously charged the university with violating the anti-discrimination provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and the books and records and records provision of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of its Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of these provisions, as well as civil penalties against the university and Broderick.
