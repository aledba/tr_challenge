  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania man accused of defrauding a victim of child sexual abuse.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that on May 29, 2012, Timothy J. E. Craig, then 58 years old, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Craig also violated the right to self-representation provision of Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which prohibits the right of a defendant to directly cross-examine a victim in the presence of another person.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Craig.  On June 4, 2013, the Pennsylvania Court of Criminal Appeals issued a judgment that permanently enjoins appellant from violating the antitrust provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Craig consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions, ordering him to disgorge his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, and requiring him to provide a written statement to the court in support of his motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the securities laws.  As a result of the court's order, Craig has agreed to a permanent injunction, to be barred from appearing or practicing before the court as a witness, and to be restrained from participating in the conduct of a criminal trial.  Additionally, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Craig and ordered him to comply with a court order prohibiting him from conducting cross-examination of a victim without first consulting the victim.  A hearing for a hearing on July 3, 2013 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. The court granted the motion for preliminary injunction and ordered a hearing for July 5, 2013 to determine whether to proceed pro se with a hearing scheduled for July 6, 2013. The hearing was conducted in the absence of a trial judge, and the case was supervised by Assistant Chief of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office in this matter."
