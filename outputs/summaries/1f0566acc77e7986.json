  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former research scientist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed on January 23, 2018, alleges that Dr. S. Leigh Phoenix, a tenured professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, provided expert testimony in support of the SEC's motion to permanently enjoin him from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, or promotion of any material that does not meet the specifications of the NIST.  According to the complaint, Dr. Yabuki was not a research scientist when he conducted his research on Zylon fiber, but instead relied on his knowledge and experience as a member of a research team that developed and tested Zylon fibers.  As a result of this, the Court agreed to permanently bar him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  In a parallel action, the United States today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Toyobo Co. Ltd. and its former head of research, Robert M. Nowak, charging that the defendants violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by failing to comply with the entry of a final Judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the defendants agreed to permanent injunctions and to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the court agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 12b-20 and Rule 13a-1 thereunder, and to the appointment of a receiver and a receiver to facilitate the issuance of the final judgment.  On March 6, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Brooklyn, New York, alleging that, among other things, that defendant David S. Lesser, a research associate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, misstated or overstated a number of technical aspects of Zylon's manufacturing, quality assurance, and supply chain management practices, and that defendant Michael A.R. Kelly, a former NIST research associate, misappropriated and misstated material from Zylon.  Kelly, Kelly, and Kelly agreed to settle the SEC case by consenting to the entry"
