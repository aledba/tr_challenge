  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against Joseph Christen Thoresen, who was convicted of first-degree premeditated murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnesota, alleges that, on June 21, 2016, the defendant and his accomplice, Kayleene Greniger, told Haiman that he needed to put down a large farm animal and would not let the farm animal go to work. The complaint further alleges that after the murder, the defendants took a four-wheeler out for a ride on J.D.\u2019s car, where they used more methamphetamine and used cocaine with Haiman. According to the complaint, after they left their apartment, they drove into the woods, where Thoreen and Greniger repeatedly hit Haiman with a machete. The SEC alleges that the defendants continued driving the car until they were arrested by the police and the grand jury. The court also denied the SEC's request for a jury instruction regarding the credibility of the accomplice. The defendants agreed to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars. The final judgments also order Thoreens to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Thoresens. The case is being handled by Scott A. Thompson, Eric R. Birkenheier, and Glenn S. Gordon of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson and Ms. Brunson, and the case will be supervised by Amy S. Cotter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Minnesota State Attorney General's Office, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice Criminal Division's Retail Strategy Task Force and the Minnesota Office of Public Health and Human Services."
