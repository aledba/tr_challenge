  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant for failing to timely respond to an employer\u2019s denial of a new/omitted medical condition claim.  According to the court order, filed in federal court in Oklahoma, on September 30, 2014, a former painter for the set of the television show Grimm, who was injured while working as a painter, fell from a lift gate of a truck and onto his back while holding an air compressor. The complaint alleges that, despite having been told by the ombudsman that he had 60 days from the date of mailing of the denial to request a hearing, he did not respond to the letter. The court also found that the letter did not refer to the denial and did not include any information about the cause of the loss.  The court further found that, in exercising its delegated discretion, the defendant failed to respond to a request for hearing within 60 days of mailing the denial.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendant. The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Oklahoma Department of Business and Consumer Services in this matter."
