  "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has obtained a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against Sayed Kameli, the former manager of the EB-5 investment program.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that Kameli violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Kameli has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1.06 million, prejudgment interest of $2.2 million, and a civil penalty of $500,000.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Kameli.  According to the SEC, Kameli also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the charged sections of the securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, and ordering Kameli to pay a $1,06 million civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Eric Phillips and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter in the Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Phillips. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Banking and Securities."
