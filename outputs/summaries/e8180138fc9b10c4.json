  "summary": "On May 1, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered summary judgment against Grange Mutual Casualty Co. (\"Grange\") for the wrongful death of Stephen P. Stetz.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, on October 15, 2015, Stephen's parents, Jeffrey and Dana Stetz, were among the first to file a civil injunctive action in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia against the insurance company.  The complaint alleges that Stephen was an insured family member under his parents' automobile policy and was entitled to coverage under the policy.  As alleged in the complaint, however, Stephen was not a resident of the family home at the time of his death, and he did not have any permanent residence.  Instead, the complaint alleges, Stephen had a residence in Chicago, was self-supporting, and had an Ohio driver's license.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Stephen.  On May 24, 2016, a federal district court in Ohio granted the Estate's motion for summary judgment, finding that Grange was liable for the loss of Stephen's motor vehicle insurance coverage.  Without admitting or denying the estate's allegations, Grange agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit in the Chicago Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
