  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Arkansas today entered a final judgment against Christopher Terrell, a convicted felon who was sentenced to twenty-three years in prison for the 2014 murder of James Hunt.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Terrell was the sole defendant in the case, and that he was the only one who had ever been convicted of first-degree murder.  According to the complaint, Terrell and his wife, Betty Grant, went to a motel with Hunt and another man and made a \"sex movie\" before they went to the house of Terrell's brother, Keith Terrell. Terrell also allegedly told the court that he had been in sexual relationships with both men and that Hunt had injected him with methamphetamine. The complaint further alleges that, in the days leading up to Hunt's murder, Grant told Terrell that she had taken him to his house to get high and make a \u201csex movie\u201d before she went back to Hunt\u2019s house and continued using the drug.  Terrell further alleged that, on November 27, 2014, he received a call from Terrell from the phone number he had provided to his brother, telling Terrell to get in his car and drive to the levee. The phone number in this case belonged to a Verizon prepaid phone, and Terrell allegedly used the number to make the call. The court found Terrell guilty on the basis of this finding and ordered him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On July 23, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Terrell against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Grant.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the SEC, Grant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of Sections 5(a)(2) and 5(c) and provides that the court will determine the amount of monetary relief to be provided by the relief ordered by the court upon motion for a preliminary injunction. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing on July 24, 2018 was scheduled for 11:30 a.m. EST."
