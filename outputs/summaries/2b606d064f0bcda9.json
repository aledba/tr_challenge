  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of felony unlawful possession of a firearm by a serious violent felon and sentenced to eight years of incarceration.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that on January 30, 2018, Lisiate Tavake, a resident of Crawfordsville, Indiana, was falsely told that he had a prior felony conviction for robbery in California, and that he was on parole for a robbery conviction in Indiana.  According to the complaint, however, Tavake was not a convicted felon and had no prior criminal history.  Instead, the complaint alleges that Tavake had been booked at the Montgomery County Jail the week before the trial and immediately informed defense counsel by telephone and provided the defense with copies of the jail booking records.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the trial court improperly allowed Tavake to enter his apartment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the court granted Tavake's motion for a continuance of the trial, which is subject to court approval.  Tavake also consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078 in prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Robert A. Hannan of the United States District Court in Indianapolis issued a temporary restraining order against Tavake and ordered him to return to his home state of Indiana to be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  Hannan also agreed to a settlement where he will be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and will be prohibited from participating in any securities offering or offering of any securities other than the securities of publicly-traded companies.  He also agreed not to participate in any offering of securities that may be deemed \"substantially similar\" to the securities offered by the Indiana securities laws.  Finally, Hannan agreed to be restrained from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and to the appointment of a receiver of the securities laws based on his prior conviction for a felony robbery.  Without admitting to any of these violations, the jury was instructed to determine whether or not to hold Tavake liable for a penalty of 10 years of imprisonment and to consider whether to hold him liable for"
