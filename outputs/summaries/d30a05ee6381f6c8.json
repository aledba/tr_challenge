  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the states in a civil injunctive action against the federal agencies that issued the IFRs in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, California, alleges that the agencies violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that, contrary to these representations, the agencies failed to adequately consider the impact on the states' financial health and the costs of providing contraceptive care.  In its order, the court held that the states had standing to challenge the federal laws, and that the agency had the right to issue the final IFR without notice and comment.  According to the court's order, however, the states did not have standing to do so because they had not submitted sufficient evidence to show that they had any reasonable basis for issuing an IFR. The court also ruled that the federal government had the ability to issue an order requiring the states to comply with the federal law.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the federal, state, and local securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The final judgment also orders the agencies to pay a civil penalty of $20,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the parties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Feb. 15, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.
