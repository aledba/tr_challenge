  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was sentenced to 50 years in prison for a felony sexual assault.  The court also issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert in clinical psychology.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on November 21, 2004, the defendant, who is intellectually disabled, was arrested and sentenced to a 50-year mandatory life sentence without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The complaint alleges that, while the defendant was receiving Social Security disability, he was not receiving any special services for his intellectual disability, and that he had expressed remorse over what he had done.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On November 24, 2014, a federal district court in Chicago issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendant to surrender his passport. The court's order temporarily suspended the defendant's right to a fair trial and ordered him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his life sentence. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael R. Hodgman and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans, Chief of the Division of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois Department of Justice."
