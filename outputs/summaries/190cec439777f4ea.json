  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) unlawfully delayed the filing of an order requiring carriers to file tariff-filing with the Commission for the period before and after the tariff went into effect.  According to the complaint, the Commission improperly delayed filing the Commission\u2019s order until it determined that certain carriers had violated the charged rate doctrine.  In its order, the court held that the Commission had a duty to determine whether a carrier was entitled to a fair and reasonable rate when it charged the charged rates to its customers.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the Complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 203 of the Communications Act of 1934, AT&T and its subsidiaries violated the duty to comply with the filed rate doctrine by failing to timely file tariffs with the FCC.    The complaint further alleges that in a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued an order temporarily restraining the defendants from violating the charged and unreasonable rate provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the complaint alleges that AT&t and its affiliates violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rules 206(3)-8 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against the defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the charged, and seeks a court-ordered asset freeze and asset freeze, as well as a permanent officer-and-director bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 21, 2019).  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by David A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission in this matter."
