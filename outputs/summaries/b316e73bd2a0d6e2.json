  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil action brought by a former foster parent who is seeking to have her child removed from her care.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to adequately supervise and monitor Doe while she was being placed in the home of Stephanie Sykes and her two sons, Dwayne and Dwayne Winston, and did not adequately monitor her.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay $19,500 in attorney fees and $6,988.37 in civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Sykes, her sons, and another defendant for their roles in the alleged scheme.  On November 17, 2016, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return to court on December 21, 2016.   The court's order, which was entered without prejudice to the defendants, also prohibits the defendants from acting as unregistered brokers in the sale or purchase of securities in the securities of any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Los Angeles Regional Office by John Rymas of the Office of Compliance and Assurance, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica of the Division of Enforcement's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Financial Regulation, the California Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service (FINRA), and the California Department of Health and Human Services (DOHA) in this matter.
