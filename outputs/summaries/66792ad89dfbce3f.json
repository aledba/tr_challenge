  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found liable for premeditated murder, burglary, robbery, street terrorism, and firearm possession.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on premeditation and deliberation as to whether a defendant should be liable for a first degree murder, attempted first degree robbery, or second degree murder.  According to the complaint, Mejia was the only defendant to have been convicted of a first-degree murder, a second-degree robbery, and a third-degree burglary.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Mejiia had been the only one to be convicted of the three felony counts.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the jury was instructed to determine whether to impose a five-year prior conviction enhancement on a defendant based on prior convictions.  Instead, the court imposed a six-year penalty on counts 1, 2, 5, 8, and 10, and ordered the jury to determine the amount of the additional five years and a half that should be served concurrently with the five years previously imposed on the other defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commissioned Litigation Release, the SEC consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, which is twice as much as the penalty imposed by the court.  On the same day, the Honorable Kathleen M. Burns of the U. S. District Judge's Office in Manhattan issued a temporary restraining order, ordering the defendant not to violate the federal securities laws, and ordering the jury not to exceed five years of deliberation and a minimum term of five years before parole eligibility.   The court also issued an order temporarily suspending the defendant's right to reapply for a hearing in the future. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt of the New York Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Criminal Justice. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Department of Banking and Securities, and the California State Attorney General's Office.  For further information, see Press Release No. 1393 (January 1, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Criminal Investigations Division."
