  "summary": "The Arizona Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order freezing the assets of a political action committee that sought to place an initiative on the November 2018 ballot.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona, alleges that, on February 9, 2018, the Arizona secretary of state issued an order freezing assets held by the committee in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The order also freezes the assets held in the committee's escrow.

On August 31, the SEC filed an amended complaint against the Committee, alleging that it violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by failing to register as a \"paid circulator\" with the Secretary. The complaint also alleges that the defendants violated Section 19-118(B)(1) and Rule 19-119 thereunder, and that the Commission violated Section 20(a) of Exchange Act Rule 20b2-1. The Commission agreed to settle the case by consenting to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining the defendants from violating Sections 10(e) and 13(b)(5) of The Exchange Act, and ordering the Commission to provide a copy of the Commission's order to the Commission on Audit and Rule 20a-3 thereunder that is subject to court approval.
