  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a temporary restraining order against a parent who has resisted a court-ordered drug treatment program.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orange County, California, alleges that the California Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) and the District Attorney's Office (DOFS) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court found, however, that the DFS exemption does not apply to parents who have resisted treatment for drug or alcohol abuse, or who have failed to comply with a court order requiring them to participate in drug treatment programs. In addition, the court found that neither parent actively resisted treatment, and thus the court did not err in offering them reunification services.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Health and Human Services (OHS) today announced that it has issued an emergency alert warning parents to be aware of any signs of relapse and to check the background of anyone who may be using or using the drug.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal in the District of Columbia, DFS failed to inform parents that their child had been successfully reunified with a sibling or half sibling with a drug treatment treatment program when the parent had failed to do so.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.\u00c2\u00a0 The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the anti-dealing provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and ordered them to return to the custody of their children.  To learn more about passive resistance and how to spot it, see the\u00c2\u00a0Resistance Rule\u00c2\u00a0on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0Investigations in this matter are ongoing, and the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Department of Justice and the California Office of Child and Family Education (OCCIE)."
