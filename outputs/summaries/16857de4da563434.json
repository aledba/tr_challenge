  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Laurance Freed, the former president and chief executive officer of Joseph Freed and Associates, a real estate development company.  The court found that Freed violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Freed lied to prospective lenders about the availability of collateral and to ensure those lenders remained in the dark about numerous defaults.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Freed signed false affidavits to the city stating that he would obtain a release of the project note from Bank of America by October 31, 2009.  As alleged in the complaint, Freed failed to even notify the city of the defaulted project note.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Freed agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the federal securities laws and ordered to pay $1.3 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  Freed also agreed to a $10 million loan modification from a bank consortium, which he agreed to.  He also agreed not to participate in any transactions that would harm the city\u2019s ability to meet its obligations under the TIF program.  Finally, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Freed from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to pay a $1 million civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in this matter."
