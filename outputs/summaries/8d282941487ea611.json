  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama yesterday entered judgments against two attorneys and three law firms in a medical-malpractice action brought by the estate of Edith Louise Mitchell, who died in April 2009.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Mobile, Alabama, on April 23, 2009, Mitchell was transported by ambulance to a Mobile hospital after complaining of chest pain. The complaint alleges that the hospital, nurses, and physicians that had treated Mitchell in the week before her death had failed to timely recognize her symptoms of withdrawal from the corticosteroid and her dehydration and that those failures hastened the organ failure that ultimately caused her death.  The complaint further alleges that Mitchell's death was caused by the failure of those health-care providers to diagnose and treat a urinary-tract infection from which Mitchell was suffering when she was hospitalized.  As alleged in the complaint, Mitchell died on April 30, 2009 and the attorneys and law firms withdrew from the case in October 2017.  On June 11, 2018, the trial court entered a final judgment in favor of Belle, finding that Belle cannot prevail on her claim because she had no knowledge of the supposed fact they had suppressed her.  In a parallel action, on July 23, 2017, a federal district court in Birmingham, Alabama entered a judgment in Belle's favor, permanently enjoining Belle from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Belle to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Belle consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requires her to pay civil penalties of $50,000 and $100,000, respectively.  Belle has also agreed to the appointment of a receiver to assist her in this matter.  A hearing for Belle on July 24, 2018 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pollock and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Office of Inspector General."
