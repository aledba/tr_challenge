  "summary": "On March 17, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment against Florida resident Eduardo Eduartez, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that, from 2011 through 2014, the Florida Department of Banking and Securities issued an order disbursing surplus funds to Florida-based Sunshores Condominium Association, Inc. (\u201cAssociation\u201d).  The complaint alleges that the court improperly disbursed the surplus funds within sixty days of the foreclosure sale.  According to the complaint, the court had jurisdiction to determine who was entitled to receive the undistributed proceeds of a foreclosure sale and to disburse the proceeds to the wrong person.  In addition, the complaint alleged that, should the property be sold at public auction, Association would be entitled to all surplus proceeds.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $31,982.30, inclusive of Association maintenance fees, interest, late fees and attorney's fees.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Glenville, Fla., alleging that, in violation of Section 45.031(1)(a), the Florida Statutes, the clerk issued a final foreclosure order on September 6, 2016 that required Association to file a claim for surplus proceeds with the court.   The court also issued a Notice of Sale on June 21, 2016 and a Judgment on July 8, 2016 ordering the clerk to disbout $32,601.05 of the surplus proceeds to Association, without requiring Association to pay the $536 in statutory fees due to the surplus trustee, and, on May 20, 2016 the clerk rescheduled the sale for June 21.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, that the clerk's issuance of the Certificate of Title was contrary to the statutory construction and the disbursement order was void because neither motion was timely filed.  Finally, the Court found that the Clerk violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(b)(5) and 15(a)(3) in the Florida Code of Practice, and that the Court violated Section 5(b).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central Florida Division of Criminal Investigation today announced criminal charges against"
