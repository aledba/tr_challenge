  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Malwarebytes Inc., a California-based company that sells computer security software, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, in late 2016, the federal district court for Manhattan entered a temporary restraining order that temporarily enjoins the company from violating the anti-spam provision of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the matter.  According to the complaint, the court also found that, under the federal law, a provider of computer-security software can be liable for any action taken to block, or help users block, certain types of online content, even if it lacked knowledge of the content.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, MalwareBytes agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Section 230, and ordering it to disgorge its ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New York announced criminal charges against Enigma Software Group USA, LLC, a Florida-based security software provider, alleging that it violated Section 230 and a related federal law provision, Section 230(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC also issued an order freezing the assets of Enigma and prohibiting it from acquiring, selling, or acquiring any security software.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action in which it obtained an emergency court order temporarily freezing the company's assets and ordering the company to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million, which is equal to the amount of money lost to the company in the emergency action.  Separately, the U.N. Office of Technology Education and Advocacy today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jennifer Chun Barry and supervised by Marc Blau. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Mr. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in this matter."
