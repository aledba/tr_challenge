  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against the defendant-appellant for malicious prosecution.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, Louisiana, alleges that, on September 1, 2012, Benjamin Tickle and his wife and a friend went to the Belle Chasse ferry landing with the intention of \"checking up on the post-hurricane condition of [their] property.\" Instead, they encountered several police officers who confronted Mr. Tickle with a.45 caliber Glock semi-automatic pistol and demanded that he return the weapon.  According to the complaint, Tickle refused to do so, and one of the officers \"approached him from behind and seized his weapon, refusing to return it unless it was disassembled and disassembled.\"  The complaint further alleges that the officer confronted Tickle, who refused to comply with the officer's orders to remove the gun from the car.  Tickle then allegedly told the officer that he would return the gun if he was deemed satisfied by the outcome of the preliminary examination.  After a trial on the merits, the jury found Tickle liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Tickle.  On December 28, 2017, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The court also issued an order temporarily suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering them to submit to the SEC a copy of the judgment.  A hearing scheduled for January 6, 2019, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
