  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of multiple counts of child sexual abuse.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, alleges that, in 2012, Joseph Walter was convicted of second-degree rape and of committing a third-degree sexual offense.  Walter was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment and required him to register as a sex offender.  According to the complaint, Walter told his mother that he had been sleepwalking when he was a child, and that, on two occasions, Walter had tried to wake his mother up in the middle of the night to tell her about his alleged experience.  He also allegedly told his brother that, while he was sleepwalking, Walter \"was putting his hands on the chair and trying to wake her up.\"  The complaint alleges that Walter replied, \"I'm just sitting back, like he's trapped.\"  Walter agreed, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the case.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for Maryland today announced criminal charges against Walter arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Walter, charging him with violating Section 15(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1. The SEC is continuing its investigation into Walter's alleged misconduct and is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, as well as an officer-and-director bar against Walter.  A hearing for the SEC is scheduled for June 5, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-402, July 17, 2018 (Washington, D.C., May 24, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Scott A. Kasper and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Werner. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the United States Attorney's Department of Maryland, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Health and Human Services."
