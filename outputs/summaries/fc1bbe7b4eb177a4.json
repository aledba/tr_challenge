  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii today entered a final judgment against Nino Abrigo, a former officer of the Honolulu Police Department, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's order, filed on May 26, 2016, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the use of the public records hearsay exception, which prohibits the entry of any material finding in a criminal case.  The court also granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-officer bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the officer who was convicted on the basis of a police report that he had read into evidence while on duty as a law enforcement officer.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC order, the officer consented to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a five-year conduct-ban.  On August 1, 2016 the court held that the officer had a reasonable opportunity to challenge the accuracy of the officer's report when he read it into evidence, and that he failed to do so during the course of the hearing.  As a result of the court order, he was sentenced to 72 hours of community service and ordered to complete a substance abuse assessment class and pay court fees.  A hearing on August 2, 2016 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. The court granted the request for an emergency restraining order and ordered the officer to return to his duties as an officer and comply with the order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Christopher Mueller and Laird C. Kirkpatrick of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and the case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Hawaii Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, and other relevant agencies. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
