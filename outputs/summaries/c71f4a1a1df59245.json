  "summary": "On February 4, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama entered a final judgment against Gainer Curtis of Alabama, ordering him to pay $25,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Mobile, Ala., alleges that, from at least 2017 through September 2017, Curtis, through his employer, Allstate Insurance Company, had offered to settle a civil action brought by Busby's widow, Bonnie S. Busby, by way of Allstate, for Curtis's personal-injury claim. According to the complaint, Busby had died in September 2017 and therefore had not been served with the claim. The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to timely file cross-claims with the court, and therefore could not maintain a claim against Curtis.  In a parallel action, on February 5, 2018, a federal district court in Birmingham, Alabama, entered a judgment against Curtis that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also ordered Allstate to comply with the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, allstate consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering it to pay civil penalties of up to $100,000, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against all of the defendants. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On June 5, 2019, the court issued a judgment ordering the defendants to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and a penalty equal to the amount of their civil penalties. The judgment also imposed a $50,000 administrative penalty against Allstate.  To learn more about administrative relief, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Feb. 4, 2018).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Office of Insurance Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
