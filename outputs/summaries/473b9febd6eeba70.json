  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Citigroup Inc. (Citigroup), El Banco Nacional De Mexico S.A. (EBC), and Banamex USA (Banamex) in a settled civil action brought by the estate of Hans Jorg Schneider Sauter.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 29, 2014, the Estate of the Mexican national filed a complaint in federal district court in New York alleging that Citigroup violated the antifraud provisions of Rule 41(d) of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to adequately disclose to the court that they were entitled to the costs, including attorneys' fees, of defending a settlement offer against a now-deceased defendant.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Delaware today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On November 10, 2015, the New York District Court held a hearing, denied the Estate's request for a temporary restraining order, and ordered Citigroup to comply with the court's order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Sansone, Eric R. Birkenheier, and Glenn S. Gordon of the Boston Regional Office, and is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson."
