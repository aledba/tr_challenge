  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against the Rio Grande State Center and a number of its employees for the death of Joshua Ray Bagley, a 37-year-old Texas man with mental health issues who was involuntarily committed to the institution for several months before he died.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, Bagley alleges that he was restrained and restrained by five other staff members who used excessive force to restrain Joshua, who died shortly thereafter.  The SEC alleges that Bagley's claims were pre-empted by the Texas Department of Health and Human Services' (DHS) pre-emption rule, and that the DHS preemption rule was preempted by federal law.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Bagley for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the Department of Justice has issued an order suspending the issuance of an emergency court order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the destruction of any evidence that may have been obtained in connection with the alleged violations of the federal securities laws.  On January 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of New York entered a judgment against Bagly, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  A hearing on February 26, 2019, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David Rushing, Sonia Hernandez-Keeble, Blas Ortiz Jr., David Moron, and David O. Sullivan of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Rogers, Ms. Cumpian, and Mr. Sullivan. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Texas Division of Criminal Justice.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the San Antonio Regional Office, under the supervision of Assistant Director of the Division of Public Health. The examination was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection of False Claims, and the case was supervised by Gregory A. Kasper of the Dallas office. The exam was performed by Thilo Burzlaff, M.D., Hector Ontiveros, Priscilla Nieto, and Sonia Hernandez Keeble of the Public Health Abuse Unit."
