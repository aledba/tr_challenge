  "summary": "On January 28, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered final judgments against defendants Alex Melendez, Gail Frank, Larry Ferk, Joe Mitchell, Swastic Srihari Kaveeshwar, and the Estate of Walter Frank.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, Melendez and his companies, Med-Rite Laboratories, LLC and Alternative Technologies International, Inc., falsely claimed that they had acquired a majority interest in a medical device that was developed by Frank Melendez. The complaint alleges that, in reality, the company had not acquired the majority interest, and that Melendez had loaned more than the permissible amount for loans by members, in violation of the operating agreement.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to establish a viable business case for their alleged misconduct.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Melendez for his role in the alleged scheme.  On January 16, 2012, the trial court entered a final judgment against Ferk Family, Mas\u2013Rite, LLC, Alternative Technologies, and Walter Frank, ordering the defendants to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The final judgments also order the parties to pay civil monetary penalties of $1,000,000 each, and impose a $500,000 bar on each of the defendants. The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 605.0801.

Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Attorney General's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
