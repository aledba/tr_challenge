  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of second-degree murder in connection with a road rage incident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on December 1, 2016, defendant Ronald M. McKnight was confronted by a man in a red pickup truck who demanded that he surrender his gun.  According to the complaint, McKnight replied, \"I'm going to get you out of my car.\"  The complaint further alleges that the defendant told the man that he had no duty to retreat, that he just wanted to get out of the car, and that he was going to \"shoot the guy up\" when he saw the other man running towards him.  McKnight allegedly refused to comply with the court's order, and instead continued to engage in a verbal altercation with the man, who was then followed by his ex-wife.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against McKnight.  On January 16, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy C. McCole granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered McKnight to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  McKnight consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,000,000 and a $100,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  McCole also agreed to be enjoined from associating with any third party in a criminal case and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any other penny stock.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the SEC, McKnight agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests and pay civil penalties of $2,500 and $250,000 respectively.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John R. Kelly and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the New Orleans Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0"
