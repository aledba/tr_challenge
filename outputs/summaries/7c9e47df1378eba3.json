  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the 26th Judicial District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against Scott Sponenberg, an Ohio-based manure management specialist, in a case that was investigated by the Commission on Environmental Quality.  According to the Commission's order, filed on February 8, 2016 in the U.C. Division of Commerce, the Commission found that, in violation of Section 402(1)(E) of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) Rule 10b-5, the provision requiring that manure management facilities not cause \"adverse impacts\" on adjacent properties, that the manure nursery and manure storage facility should be developed without adverse impacts, and that the \"facility design and specifications\" required by the DEP should not be preempted.  The Commission also found that the application for a special exception did not meet the requirements of Section 519 of the NMA.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Spoonenberg.  On February 9, 2016, the Court issued a temporary restraining order and an order suspending the application pending final approval of the final judgment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission&rsquo;s order, Spoonenburg consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  To settle the matter further, the court granted the Commission the right to determine the amount of money to be spent on the project and the appropriate amount of remediation, including a $100,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer and director bar. The court also issued an order requiring the Commission to conduct an independent examination of the application. The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael M. Meloy and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 26, 2016)."
