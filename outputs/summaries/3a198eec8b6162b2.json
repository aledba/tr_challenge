  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered final judgments against Donald V. Cain, Jr., a former Custer County assessor, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 77-1507 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Broken Bow, Nebraska, alleges that, from 2006 to 2012, Cain raised the value of his property by approximately 250 percent when compared with valuations placed on other irrigated land.  According to the complaint, Cain's property was valued between $734,968 and $1,834,925, which represents nearly a 250 percent property tax increase from the prior year.  Cain also raised the issue of whether he was entitled to a hearing on the merits of his claims and whether he had the authority to determine the actual value of the property for tax purposes.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Cain.  On May 2, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Cain, charging him with violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his income.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, however, Cain consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains, and orders a conduct-based injunction against future violations, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, from participating in the issuance of any federal securities law, from purchasing or selling any real estate, for any purpose other than to purchase or lease a home.  Additionally, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Cain and ordered him to comply with the court order, which requires him to provide an accounting of his assets and to pay a civil monetary penalty of $250,000.  As a result of the SEC order, Cain will be barred from serving on the Commission of Equalization, which is responsible for the valuation of any agricultural property, other than those that are subject to the Commission's approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 24, 2016).  The Commission of Inspections and Examinations has issued an order requiring it to conduct an independent review of all claims in its books and records.  A hearing is scheduled for May 26, 2016.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office, with assistance from"
