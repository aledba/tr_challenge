  "summary": "On March 4, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans entered a final judgment against Entergy Services, Inc., a publicly-traded utility holding company, for violating the filed rate doctrine.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, alleges that, beginning in 1951, six companies entered into an arrangement to share the costs and benefits of power generation and transmission with other operating companies. According to the complaint, the agreement provided for the sharing of the benefits of the settlement benefits with the Operating Companies, and required Entergy Arkansas to enter into a pre-withdrawal agreement with the other Operating Companies. The complaint further alleges that the settlement did not impose an obligation to pay an exit fee, and that Entergy was not obligated to do so because the settlement was in force at the time the operating companies were injured.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2010, when Entergy left the Entergy System, it entered into a partial settlement agreement with Union Pacific, which locked in a below-market rate for the rail delivery of coal at-cost. The settlement, as relevant to the present petition for review, locked in an exemption for Entergy from the charged rate.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Entergy has consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty. The final judgment also orders Entergy to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Entergy also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer and director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from serving on the board of directors of any public company that is not a member of the Public Service Commission.  On March 8, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, an injunction, and a temporary restraining order against future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against Enterg Services. The SEC is continuing its investigation into whether or not to issue an order imposing an injunction or requiring a hearing to determine whether to proceed with the litigation. The case is being handled by John R. Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Public Finance Abuse Unit and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis."
