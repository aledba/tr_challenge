  "summary": "On June 7, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi entered final judgments against Rebuild America Inc. (\"Rebuild\"), a Mississippi-based real estate development company, and its owner, Jane Drew (\"Drew I\") in a civil action brought by the SEC.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Drew failed to pay the ad valorem taxes assessed on her home in Diamondhead, Mississippi.  According to the complaint, Drew did not redeem the property by paying the taxes within the two-year redemption period.  Instead, the complaint alleges, Drew filed an answer and counterclaim in a complaint in Drew I, which was filed in Drew II.  In Drew II, the court ruled that Drew had waived her right to challenge the tax sales pursuant to a 2010 agreement between Drew and Rebuild, and that Drew was entitled to statutory notice of the sale.  Drew also failed to timely respond to the SEC's final judgment in Drew III, which ruled that the 2009 and 2010 tax sales were void because the chancery clerk failed to comply with statutory notice requirements.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Drew agreed to pay $5,710 on or before February 28, 2011, for the title to her Diamondhead home.  As set forth in the SEC complaint, the final judgment against Drew II permanently enjoins Drew from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Drew to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of her income.  Additionally, Drew has agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer and sale of any securities, and to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On June 8, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Drew, seeking a permanent injunction against her, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Drew.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 24, 2019).  The complaint also names Rebuild as a defendant in the civil action, and seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the federal securities laws, as well as an order appointing a receiver to oversee the sale of the property pursuant to the 2010 agreement.  A hearing is scheduled for July 26, 2019.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas of the Mississippi Office of Financial Regulation, and the litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper."
