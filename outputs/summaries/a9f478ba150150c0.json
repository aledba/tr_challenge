  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Scott Jacob Smith, Jr., a convicted child pornography violator, for violating the double jeopardy provision of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Smith violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Smith was charged with knowing receipt and possession of child pornography in a single count.  Smith consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, imposes a two-level penalty, and orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Smith agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, and agreed to a five-year civil penalty, the same statutory maximum as knowing receipt.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Smith.  On March 15, 2013, the jury found Smith guilty of knowing receipt of, and then acquiring, child pornography from a computer he traced to an IP address in Indianola, Iowa. The court also ordered Smith to pay $20,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his criminal conviction.  To settle the case, the court granted Smith's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, ordered a conduct-based injunction, and ordered Smith and his wife to cooperate in the investigation of the matter.  As a result of the court\u2019s order, Smith has agreed to permanent injunctions, to be barred from the securities industry, and to be restrained from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the sale or purchase of any security, including, without limitation, the right to reapply as an officer or director of a public company after five years of service.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Missouri Attorney General's Office in this matter."
