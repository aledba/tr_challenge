  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a California-based real estate agent and broker who allegedly failed to sufficiently trace his separate property to pay for the construction of a house.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Santa Clara County, California on March 14, 2014, Husband and his wife, Colleen McLain, were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  The SEC alleges that Husband failed to adequately trace the money from the sale of his San Dimas house used to construct the Big Bear house, and that the court improperly awarded him $5,500 in attorney's fees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their respective salaries.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Husband.  On March 16, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, charging them with violating Section 5(a) of the securities laws, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-3 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint also charges Husband with violating Sections 5(b), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) of Securities Act Section 10b(b)(5) and (3) of Exchange Act Section 13(b).  The court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, entered an order appointing a receiver, and appointed a receiver for the receivership of the receiver. The receiver was named as a receiver by the court.  As a result of the court's order, the receiver was not required to trace the receiver's separate property.  Husband is seeking a judgment ordering him to disgorge $1,078 in ill-gotten gains plus interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The receiver has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and ordered to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty and a $500,000 civil penalty.  He also agreed to be barred from the securities industry for five years"
