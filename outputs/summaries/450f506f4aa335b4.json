  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment in favor of a Colorado-based company and its founder in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, alleges that the Colorado Department of Health and Human Services (CDHCPF) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1396p(c)(2)(A) of the federal Medicaid Act of 1940 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to adequately consider the issues raised in the complaint and instead issued a second amended complaint, this time alleging that the third amended complaint did not support the defendants' claims.  In addition, the court found that the defendants violated the federal preclusion provisions of \u00a71396p, which requires states to determine whether a person is entitled to a right of action under federal law.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requiring them to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $87,000 and $1,500, respectively.  On May 10, 2016, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Snyder granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to comply with the court's order.  A hearing scheduled for June 14, 2016 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Division of Health, Human Services, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.
