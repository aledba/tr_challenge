  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Carroll County man accused of driving under the influence (DUI) and harboring a runaway.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Carroll County, New York, alleges that William L. Nemec violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The complaint also alleges that defendant failed to comply with a court order to revoke his court supervision.  According to the complaint, Nemec consented to the revocation without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains his right to counsel. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Nemec to pay $2,500.00 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his sentence.  Nemec agreed to the court's order and agreed to a permanent injunction, to be suspended from appearing or practicing before the court, and to pay all remaining court-ordered fines and costs. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a judgment against Nemec, permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (a)(2) of The Securities Act, and ordering him to pay an additional $1.5 million in restitution and a $100,000 penalty.  On March 17, 2017, the court issued an order suspending Nemec from appearing, practicing, or appearing in public before it. The order also imposed a penalty of $'1,500, which Nemec has agreed to pay, and ordered him to perform 240 hours of community service. The judge granted the request for an emergency court order, and the court granted Nemec's motion for a preliminary injunction. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Defender's Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Department of Justice Criminal Division Criminal Division, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Federal Office of the Attorney General."
