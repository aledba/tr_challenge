  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that defendant Vivek Subramanian, a California resident, falsely claimed that he had developed a method of precharging and evaluating the precharge and evaluation transistors, which he described as \"transient\" and \"inactive.\"  According to the complaint, however, the jury was repeatedly told not to consider intent when making its direct infringement determination.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Dr. Ivey provided unrebutted testimony that, contrary to what he claimed, he had identified the delay elements in the precharges and evaluated transistors.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Donnelly of the United States District Court in Manhattan entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendant, and ordering a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, ordering a permanent injunction, ordering the destruction of any evidence, and imposing a conduct-based injunction against the defendant.   The court also ordered the defendant to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert on this matter, warning investors to be aware of the potential for fraud in the securities industry.  Investors can check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0investors.gov to quickly identify if they are professionals and to check whether they have any experience with securities law violations."
