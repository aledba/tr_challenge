  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Isa Noel on the basis of newly discovered evidence of juror misconduct.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges Noel with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Noel.  According to the complaint, Noel, who worked as a security officer at St. Thomas\u2019s Cyril E. King Airport, was not diligent in discovering that two of his co-defendants had been convicted of drug-trafficking and had been sentenced to prison terms ranging from 18 months to 151 months.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Noel consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(A), and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, a $50,000 civil penalty, and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged scheme.  On the other hand, the court granted Noel a temporary restraining order and ordered him to comply with the court's order, which requires him to provide a copy of the complaint to the court.  To learn more about jury selection, see Litigation Release Release Order No. 539 F.3d (3d Cir. 2014).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the New York Regional Office.  A hearing will be conducted by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
