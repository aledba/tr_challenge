  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Clean Harbors Surface Rentals USA, Inc. (\"Clean Harbors\"), a Massachusetts-based company that provides environmental, energy, and manufacturing services to companies in the oil and gas industry.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Norwell, Massachusetts on January 24, 2019, clean Harbors and its owner, Nathan McCullough, raised the issue of whether or not to conditionally certify a collective action under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1940 (\"FLSA\").  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the company paid workers a daily rate, or a \"day rate,\" with no overtime pay, and that Drilling Professionals was not a required party under the FLSA.  In addition, according to the complaint, the defendants did not pay day-rate workers overtime and did not receive required overtime pay as a result of the company's policies and practices.  The SEC alleges that the defendants violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder, and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the court has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requires them to provide a civil penalty of $75,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
