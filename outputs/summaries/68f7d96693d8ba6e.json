  "summary": "On November 21, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a New York City-based municipal licensing authority for taxis and other for-hire vehicles.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, in 1986, Larry Tinsley, a disbarred lawyer who spent much of his adult life in prison, applied for a license to drive a taxi or a vehicle-for-hire vehicle.  According to the complaint, the Commission denied his application for a TLC license because he had been convicted of armed robbery with a firearm, for which he was sentenced to 28 years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the Commission for its role in this matter.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on November 19, 2016, the Court granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the Commission to conduct a full and fair review of its policies and procedures. The Commission's investigation was conducted by Alex Yoh and supervised by Marc Blau. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the New York State Department of Health and Human Services.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 753(1).  The Complaint charges that the Commission violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint or the Court's order, the commission has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer and director bar. The court also granted the commission's motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  On November 24, 2016 the Commission issued its final judgment, ordering the SEC to conduct an independent investigation into the matter and determine whether to proceed with a related administrative proceeding.  A hearing scheduled for November 26, 2016 was scheduled for 11:30 a.m. Eastern.  An SEC examination that led to the examination of the complaint found that, among other things, no evidence of a prior criminal conviction was sufficient to determine whether a person was entitled to a fair and reasonable opportunity to perform one or more of the duties and responsibilities of a public or private employer."
