  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in favor of the Blackfeet Reservation Development Fund (BRDF) against Dennis M. Gingold, a member of the Board of Directors of the BRDF, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, Gingold and his co-counsel, Earl Old Person, Thomas Maulson, agreed to pay $85.4 million of the $99 million in attorneys' fees to the Foundation.  The complaint alleges that Gingold refused to recognize any obligation on his part to pay any of the fees and/or costs of the Litigation until the funds were repaid in full.  Gingold also allegedly refused to honor any obligation to reimburse the Foundation's fees.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Gingold.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering Gingold to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $2,532,195. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Mississippi Office of Inspector General."
