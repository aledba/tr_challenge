  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendants Jon Heil and Beverly Heil, who were parties to a land sale contract for certain real property in Tillamook, North Carolina. The court entered a supplemental judgment on April 16, 2015, finding that, for the purposes of determining whether or not to award attorney fees and costs, the court should determine that the offer of judgment exceeded plaintiff\u2019s ultimate judgment and that, accordingly, plaintiff was entitled only to the fees and expenses that it had incurred prior to the offer and not those incurred through the entire litigation.  The court also ruled that, in determining whether to award an attorney fee or costs, plaintiff could not recover attorney fees or costs incurred up to the date of the offer.  According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, the Court found that, under the current version of ORCP 54 E, the amount of the judgment that plaintiff received was $6,801 plus the $1,400.10 in attorney fees that plaintiff had incurred before the offer was made and not the $2,600 that the court had previously awarded to her.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the court to determine whether to impose a civil penalty against each defendant.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for North Carolina today announced criminal charges against both defendants.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the New York District Court issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The order also imposed a $28,752.32 civil penalty for each defendant, and a $9,200.10 administrative penalty against defendant Jon.  To settle the charges, defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the issuance of an order requiring them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The settlement agreement also provided that defendants would have 90 days to vacate the property and have a judgment entered against them in the pending litigation. In addition, the settlement agreement provided the prevailing party a right to attorney fees if either party successfully prosecuted or defended an action relating to the rights or obligations under the agreement. The Court also ordered the defendants to pay $8,509.64 in civil penalties"
