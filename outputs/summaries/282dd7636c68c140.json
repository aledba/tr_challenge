  "summary": "On March 9, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana entered a final judgment against the City of Missoula and Carlyle Infrastructure Partners LP in a civil injunctive action brought by Property Owners seeking to recover attorney and expert fees from the city.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Montana, the city and its subsidiary, Mountain Water Company (Mountain Water), made a final written offer of $50 million to purchase the water system, which was rejected by the City.  The complaint alleges that the City and Mountain Water violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the District Court issued a scheduling order that gave the parties six months to complete discovery and pre-trial filings, and scheduled a trial date shortly thereafter.  Property Owners' attorneys and experts ultimately retained attorneys from Denver, Chattanooga, Billings, and Seattle to handle the city's condemnation action.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Property Owners consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and order the city to pay $1.8 million in attorney fees and $1 million in expenses, and require the City to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, and the case has been supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Montana Secretary of State's Office, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Mont., and the Montana Office of Insurance Regulation."
