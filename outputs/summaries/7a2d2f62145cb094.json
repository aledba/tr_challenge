  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment in favor of a Seattle attorney who has agreed to pay $5,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, alleges that Delvonn Heckard, through Beauregard, filed documents with the court for the improper purpose of generating publicity in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Murray's attorney, Robert Sulkin, filed a subpoena and/or notice of deposition to show that Murray had paid him for sex while Heckard was a minor. The SEC further alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, Murray was not entitled to a hearing or to a jury trial because he was not a member of the SEC's Board of Governors at the time. The court found that Murray violated the bar for filing the documents, and issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and imposing civil penalties. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against Murray, charging him with violating the bar provisions of Sections 5(i) and 5(ii) and the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws. The case is being handled by the Office of Compliance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Seattle Office of the Attorney General. The litigation will be led by BeAuregard and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for New York and the FBI in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Feb. 13, 2019)."
