  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered final judgments against Grants Pass, Oregon, and the city of Grants Pass in a civil action brought by the Bureau of Labor and Industries (BOLI).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oregon, alleges that, in 1969 and earlier this year, the federal government issued an order requiring the city to pay overtime to its firefighters.  According to the complaint, the order required that all firefighters be on duty in 24-hour shifts, with each crew working a repeating schedule of either one day on, two days off, or two days on, four days off.  The complaint also alleged that, despite a federal law requiring firefighters to work more than 56 hours per week, the city did not require any of its firefighters to do so.  In addition, BOLI's complaint alleges that the city's use of the plural term \"firefighters\" in the safe harbor provision is likely a simple reflection of \"the unremarkable reality that [typically] more than one firefighter works in a fire department, and thus refers to the individual average hours of those multiple firefighters.\"  The court's judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins the city from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay an $80,000 civil penalty to each firefighter who is not required to work an average of 56 hours during a quarter of a fiscal year.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court also ordered the city not to pay any overtime to any firefighter, and to pay a civil penalty of $20,000.

Finally, the complaint seeks an injunction against future violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and seeks a permanent injunction from future violations.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 652.060 (1)(a) and Rule 206(c).  In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained an order appointing a receiver to determine the appropriate method of calculating overtime for all of the fire departments in the country.  A hearing on the matter is scheduled for May 17, 2019.  On May 19, 2019, the SEC issued an Order appointing a Receiver to determine whether to pay or not pay overtime.  This order requires the receiver to"
