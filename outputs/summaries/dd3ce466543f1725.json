  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Michael Christane Murray, finding him liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Murray, who was previously convicted of felony theft, entered and remained in the victim\u2019s house after she demanded that he leave the house.  According to the complaint, the victim told her husband that she had told him to \"leave her house.\"  The complaint further alleges that defendant told the victim that he didn\u2019t have a possessory interest in the house and that he had never entered or remained in it.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the victim had told the defendant to leave her house when she asked him to leave.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, Murray refused to comply with the court order, telling the victim to \"let me go.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Murray.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Murray consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Murray also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone granted the SEC a temporary restraining order against Murray, ordering him to surrender his passport, and appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver. The receiver was not permitted to enter or remain in the receiver's house for a period of time, and the receiver was prohibited from entering or leaving the receiver-held receiver.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2019, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Missouri Department of Insurance, the Mississippi Department of Banking and Securities, the Alabama Department of Health and Human Services, the Georgia Department of Corrections, the FBI, the State Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.
