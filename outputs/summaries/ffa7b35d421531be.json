  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a Polish citizen who was sentenced to probation for a felony sexual assault in the fourth degree.  According to the SEC's complaint, Jerzy G., a citizen of Poland, filed an application for the pretrial diversionary program of accelerated rehabilitation in 2006. The complaint alleges that the defendant, who was previously deported in January 2012, violated the terms of his probation by failing to complete the accelerated rehabilitation program.  The complaint further alleges that, despite having been deported, the defendant continued to participate in the program despite having overstayed his visa.  As alleged in the complaint, the court improperly denied the defendant's efforts to have the criminal charge dismissed and, thus, terminated his probation.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On April 21, 2014, a federal district court in Manhattan granted the defendant a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay a $1,500 cash or surety bond. The court also issued a rearrest warrant, which it later vacated.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the SEC, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (\"Advisers\").  The judgment also permanently enjoins the defendant from violating Section 13(b)(5) and 13(a)(2) of Exchange Advisers and Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1 thereunder.  It also orders the defendant to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $5,000, which will be offset by a civil penalty of $500,000.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Kevalis and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Polish Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Polish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in this matter."
