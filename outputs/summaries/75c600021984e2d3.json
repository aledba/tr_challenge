  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against a St. Paul man who was convicted and sentenced for two felony counts of possession of a firearm and ammunition.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minneapolis, alleges that Lawrence Bernard Nowels was improperly sentenced for one of the felony counts and improperly convicted for two other felony counts.  According to the complaint, Nowels, who lives in Minnesota, went to a gas station on October 2, 2017, and asked for a gun and ammunition trial. The complaint alleges that the prosecutor improperly used surveillance video of Nowels in the market to support the state\u2019s theory that he hid the gun there. The court found that Nowels violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Minnesota today announced criminal charges against Nowels.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 609.035 (2016).  The complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order, an officer-and-director bar, and an order requiring the defendant to surrender his passport.  On November 23, 2016, the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws and ordered a hearing on November 24, 2016 to determine whether to issue an order permanently enjoining Nowels from future violations of these provisions and ordering him to comply with the court's order. The hearing will be conducted by Jan Folena and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Ms. Folena. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Minnesota State Attorney General's Office, and the Minnesota Department of Criminal Justice."
