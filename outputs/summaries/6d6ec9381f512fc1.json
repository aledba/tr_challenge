  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of a Tuscaloosa liquor license application against Sana Ahmed Taleb.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that Taleb's husband and manager, Yaqoob Alshega, provided the city council with information concerning the potential negative impact that a city council's denial of a liquor license would have on the residential neighborhoods surrounding FSM.  According to the complaint, the information presented to the city was of better quality and quantity than that presented in the present case.  For example, the complaint alleges that, although the applicant had requested the liquor licenses from the city, she had not received any evidence to support her claims that the city's denial was arbitrary and capricious because there was no evidence to prove that the issuance of the licenses would create a nuisance or be \"clearly detrimental to adjacent residential neighborhoods or the public health, safety and welfare.\"  The complaint further alleges that the complaint was based on information presented in a recorded city-council meeting in which Taleb and her husband raised the issue of whether the city should issue retail liquor licenses to FSM, and that, based on that information, the city would not issue the licenses.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the southern district of Alabama today announced criminal charges against Taleb arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Taleb consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against her from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by the Office of the United States District Judge in the Birmingham Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alabama Office of Financial Regulation."
