  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who settled a civil action brought by the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California against him.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on December 6, 2010, defendant Michael Jundt, a structural engineer, submitted a false insurance policy that excluded coverage for a loss caused by a combination of covered and excluded perils.  According to the complaint, the insurance policy excluded coverage if the loss was proximately caused by any of the above-mentioned perils, or if the risk of loss was greater than the actual cause of the loss.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his illusory compensation.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court in Manhattan today entered final judgments against defendant Edward J. Connolly, an insurance agent, and his company, United Services Auto Group, Inc., in which Connolly agreed to settle the case.  Connolly also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security in connection with the issuance of an officer-and-director bar.  Donnelly agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 530 of the Exchange Act, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a $1,000,000 civil penalty to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  On May 8, 2018, the U-S District Court entered a judgment against Connolly against the defendants, ordering a permanent injunction against future violations, and ordering Connolly to pay a civil monetary penalty of $2,500.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Arizona Office of Insurance Regulation, and the Arizona Department of Insurance."
