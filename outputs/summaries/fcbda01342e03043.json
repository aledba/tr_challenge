  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the District of Niagara Falls against a former school district employee who was terminated for failing to comply with the district's residency policy.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, N.Y. District Judge Michael J. Burt of Buffalo, New York, on May 10, 2009, Judge Burt issued a temporary restraining order halting the District's investigation of the alleged violations of the residency policy and ordering the District to conduct an independent review of the matter.  The complaint alleges that the District improperly transferred the case to the Office of Human Resources, which reviewed the matter and found that, contrary to the policy, the District did not meet the burden of proof necessary to determine whether a resident of the district was in violation of the policy. The complaint also alleges that, in 2001, when she was hired as a school district district attorney, she and her husband moved to Niagara Falls, and that, as a tenured employee, she was entitled to a pre-termination hearing on the basis of her residency.  In addition, in 2009, the Board terminated her employment, effective immediately, on September 24, 2009.  As alleged in the complaint, this decision was arbitrary and capricious, as the District had no reasonable basis to conclude that she had abandoned her domicile there.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the district has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the residency provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and imposing an officer-and-director bar. The District has also agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, with the amount of disgorgement to be determined by the court at a later date. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Burt and Ms. Barry. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Education, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
