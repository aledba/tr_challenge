  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Rhode Island today announced charges against a Providence, Rhode Island man for his role in a January 2014 armed robbery and attempted second-degree robbery.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on January 28, 2014, Mary Celletti was home alone and getting ready to watch \"the presidential address\" when she realized that someone was outside and wanted to come in. The complaint further alleges that the defendant asked her daughter to sit down on her bed and she did so, but the man pointed a gun at her face and demanded that she open the door and let him enter. The court entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $25,000. The defendant also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today granted the SEC's motion for a new trial against Jody Johnson, a defendant who was found guilty on all three counts of first-degree criminal possession of a firearm in a dwelling house with intent to commit robbery. The SEC also granted the defendant's request for a writ of certiorari, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $5,000 and $10,000, respectively.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Johnson consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any securities in the future. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2017, the Honorable Kathleen M. Burns of the U. S. District Court in Providence entered a temporary restraining order against Johnson, who was also convicted on the same charges. On May 3, 2018, Judge Burns issued a preliminary injunction against Johnson and ordered him to comply with the court's order. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Rhode Island Attorney General's Office, and the Massachusetts State Corporation Commission in this matter."
