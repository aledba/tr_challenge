  "summary": "On December 19, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana entered final judgments against Axiall, LLC and Texas Brine Company, LLC in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, alleges that, in 2014 and 2015, the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (\"DNR\") and Assumption Parish Board of Review (\"BOC\") improperly valued six brine wells and caverns at issue. The complaint further alleges that Axiomall sought to determine the fair market value of the wells by valuation them in accordance with the DNR's Rules and Regulations. The Commission's final judgments, which were ultimately enjoined by the court, held that the wells were not \"commercial\" and that the caverns were not used as a separate commercial improvement. Aximall's complaint also alleged that, contrary to the Commission's findings, the wells at issue had no commercial value and were not being used for any commercial purpose. The SEC also alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 15(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") (\"Exchanges Act\") as well as Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. The court also found that the Defendants violated Section 2323B of the Commission and Rules and Rules 23rd and 24th, and that they violated Sections 5(a)(1) and 5(c) and (3) of The Securities Act. The Court also ruled that Axiemall violated Section 15a of the Exchange Act and Rules 15a-1 and (2) thereunder and that it violated Rule 15e-3 thereunder; that it was liable to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $5,627.50.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New Orleans today announced parallel criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the SEC's continuing investigation, the litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Boca Raton and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FSA) in this matter."
