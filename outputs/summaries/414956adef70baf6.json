  "summary": "On July 19, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against Wyoming County Human Services, Inc. (\"HHS\") and Wyoming County Child Protective Services (\"CPSL\") that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that from approximately 2:00 p.m. on September 3, 2016 through Monday, September 5, 2016, Child was in the home with his mother and sister when the alleged abuse occurred.  According to the complaint, Child's injuries were so severe that he was in severe pain and unable to move his legs or ambulate.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Child's mother was present and represented by counsel at the time of the alleged physical abuse when she confronted her son about his injuries.   The complaint further alleges that CYS failed to establish a prima facie presumption of child abuse when it accepted HHS's acceptance of the post-hearing brief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order, HHS consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"), Sections 10(b) and 13(b)(2)(A) thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 thereunder of the Exchange Act.  HHS also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services (POH), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Pennsylvania Office of Child and Family Education (OBIE) in this matter."
