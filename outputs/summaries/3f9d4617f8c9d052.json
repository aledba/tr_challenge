  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against William Jerome Howard, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to a mandatory minimum of ten years to life.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Howard was arrested and charged with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The complaint alleges that, as a result of Howard\u2019s prior drug convictions, he was subject to mandatory minimum penalties ranging from five to 40 years. As alleged in the complaint, Howard also had prior felony drug convictions for which he was sentenced as a career offender. The SEC also alleges that Howard had prior convictions for possession of cocaine with intent to sell, in violation of the mandatory minimum, and that he had a prior felony conviction for the sale of cocaine. Howard also has prior felony convictions for two other controlled substance offenses, for the purchase, sale, and possession of a controlled substance. Howard has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his sentence. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Miami Regional Office and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case has been supervised by Kelly L.
