  "summary": "On March 11, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of two felony counts of premeditated murder and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albany, New York, alleges that, on February 16, 2014, a jury at the Albany Regional Office found that defendant Andrew Batson, who was a member of the jury, had acted as an unregistered agent in the commission of a criminal case.  According to the complaint, Batson was the only defendant who had ever been convicted of a felony for committing such a crime, and the jury found Batson liable for the majority of the defendants' violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar.  Batson also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Batson.  On March 19, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order freezing Batson's assets.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for March 21, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-14, Litigation Bulletin No. 13-20-20.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the New York Regional Office and supervised by Eric Werner of the Division of Criminal Justice.   The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
