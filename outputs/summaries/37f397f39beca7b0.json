  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia today entered a final judgment in favor of the state's Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHR) in an abuse and neglect case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Virginia, alleges that the DHHR improperly assessed the best interests of the children, including the children\u2019s mother and aunt, when placing the children with their paternal uncle and aunt.  According to the complaint, the court found that the children were not entitled to permanent custody and instead were placed with their uncles and aunt because they had no relationship with the children.  In addition, the complaint alleges that R.L. and K.L., who were allegedly abused and neglected by their parents, were unable to provide for the children during the pendency of the proceedings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Virginia Department of Children and Family Services."
