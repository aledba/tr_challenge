  "summary": "On June 12, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil injunctive action against them.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), West Belmont, LLC, a Chicago real estate developer, and Metro Developers, L.L.C., a Chicago-area real estate development company, violated Section 5 of the Chicago Municipal Code (\"Municipal Code\") for the transfer of title to residential townhomes inside of enterprise zones.  According to the complaint, the defendants primarily used the properties for residential purposes and did not qualify for the exemption under M.D. Code \u00a7 3-33-060(L).  The complaint also alleges that the defendants failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the properties were used primarily for commercial purposes and that they were not exempt from the transfer tax exemption.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On June 14, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $3.75 per $500 of the transfer price of the property, which is equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $2.5 million, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty for each of them. The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 5, and issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an order imposing a civil injunction. The order also ordered the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver. The receiver has agreed to the appointment of a receiver, who will determine the appropriate amount of restitution to be paid by the receiver and the receiver of the seized property.  A receiver will be named as a relief defendant on the same day the receiver is due to issue his or her order. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Department of Commerce in this matter."
