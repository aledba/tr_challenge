  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a former Chicago police officer who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that on May 24, 2016, Christopher Cannata was on patrol with two officers when they received a call about a man with a gun in possession of a gun. According to the complaint, the officers confronted the man and asked him to show his hands, which he did not do. The complaint alleges that the officers conducted a Terry stop on the man, which resulted in the discovery of a semi-automatic handgun in his pocket. The officers immediately arrested the man. The SEC alleges that, upon discovery of the gun, defendant refused to comply with the officers' requests to see his hands and turned away from them. The court also found that, after the officers entered their vehicle, the defendant did not comply with their requests to show their hands and, instead, placed one hand into his pocket and, without any inquiry into whether the officers had probable cause to arrest him, kicked the gun out of his pocket, and handcuffed him.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Cannata. The case is being handled by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Chicago Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, and the Illinois Department of State Bureau of Criminal Investigation."
