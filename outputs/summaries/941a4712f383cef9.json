  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of committing a double-murder in 2011.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that the defendant, Cheng Sun (Sun), and Jun Di Lin (Lin) robbed and beat a restaurant employee, Shui Woo, during a two-month trial.  According to the complaint, Sun and Lin entered the restaurant on September 27, 2011 and demanded that the victim open a safe. The defendant allegedly used a crowbar and a hammer to beat the victim, who was unable to speak Cantonese. The complaint alleges that Sun, Lin, and Lin then stole a safe containing approximately $2,800 in cash and a $50,000 in jewelry. The SEC also alleges that Lin and Lin attempted to trick the victim into opening the safe, but the defendant did not comply with the judge's orders to do so.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Sun.  On September 29, 2016, the Honorable Judge Richard J. Walker of the U. S. District court for the Northern District of Connecticut granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The order also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock or offering of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of imprisonment. The court also ordered the defendant to surrender his passport, which he did not have, and that he would not be liable for the amount of money that he lost in the alleged scheme. The jury deliberated for two hours before finding the defendant guilty on all of the charges. The final judgment orders a permanent injunction against the defendant and Sun, and orders the judge to appoint a new trial judge. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Boston Regional Office."
