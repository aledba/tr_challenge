  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Powertech USA, Inc., a South Dakota-based mining company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, in 2014, the Commission issued an order suspending Powertech's license to conduct an in-situ leach uranium mining project in the Oglala Sioux Tribe of South Dakota. The Commission's order temporarily suspended the project pending the outcome of a court-ordered review of the Commission\u2019s order. The complaint also alleges that the Commission failed to adequately assess the potential environmental impact of the project.  In a parallel action, on May 20, 2016, the United States District Judge in the District of Columbia granted the Commission a temporary restraining order and ordered the Commission to consider whether to suspend the license.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, Powertech agreed to a permanent injunction and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be imposed by the court upon the Tribe. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Margaret S. McCole granted the Tribe's request for an emergency court order suspending the mining company from violating the federal securities laws. The court also granted the tribe an expedited hearing to determine whether to revoke the company's license or not. The Court also granted a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 17(a)(1) of\u00c2\u00a0The Securities Act of 1933, and ordered Powertech to comply with the court order.  According to the complaint, the SEC's order, which was entered without prejudice, requires the agency to provide a detailed environmental impact statement before issuing a license. The SEC also requires the company to provide an accounting of any potential adverse environmental impact.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 24, 2016).  The Commission has also issued an emergency order suspending all mining permits pending final approval by the Court.  A hearing scheduled for October 12, 2018 is being conducted to determine if the Commission has jurisdiction over the issues raised by the Tribe in this matter.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Justice's Office of Environmental Education and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The case is being supervised by Eric R. Werner."
