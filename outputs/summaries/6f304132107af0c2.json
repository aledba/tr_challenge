  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against a former correctional officer for his role in a recent disciplinary action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Jeffrey J. Hunt, a former corrections officer at Scotland Correctional Institution, was terminated on the basis of his alleged absence from work on August 18, 2016.  According to the complaint, Hunt, who was assigned to the unit manager's office, was asked to sign a letter stating that he had resigned from his position as a member of the unit.  As alleged, Hunt replied to the letter by saying that he was tired of being accused of wrongdoing and that he wanted to go back to work.  However, the complaint alleges that Hunt did not submit a legally effective resignation.  Instead, Hunt allegedly walked out of the prison through the main door and into the night shift line-up.  On November 9, 2016, the Alabama Department of Health and Human Services (ALDHS) issued an order requiring Hunt to submit a letter to the agency informing him that he would not be able to return to work because he had no recollection of being absent from work that occurred three months prior.  In a parallel action, the SEC today announced that it has obtained a final judgment against Hunt that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $11,720.00 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest.  Additionally, on November 10, 2017, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Hunt and ordered him to comply with the agency's requests for a hearing on the merits of the case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Hunt consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently restrains him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and requires him to repay the amount that he has already repaid by the time he has served as an officer or director of a public agency.   The court also ordered Hunt to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office, with the assistance of the Office of Inspector General's Office, and the Division of Criminal Justice's Office's Office of Compliance."
