  "summary": "On May 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Paul C. Wildenthaler and his wife, Kay C.Wildenthaler, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that, on June 22, 2013, at 2:00 a.m., the defendants entered into a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint. The court also ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000 and ordered them to disgorge their ill health, prejudgment interests, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws. The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the judgment. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 4, 2019, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendants from using or selling any securities, including securities in the securities industry, and ordered the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the defendants' medical records. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, an officer and director bar, and the appointment of a receiver for the victims of the opioid epidemic.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Wadika, Michael Little, and John Wyman of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Wadika and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
