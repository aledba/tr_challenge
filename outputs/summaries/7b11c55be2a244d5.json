  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas today entered a final judgment against Arkansas Department of Human Services (DHS) Judge Steven Blackwood, finding that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that Blackwood violated Section 9(b)(3)(B) and 10(e) of that federal securities law.  According to the complaint, Blackwood was placed in the care of his paternal grandmother, Mary Ann Heath, when she was incarcerated for manufacturing methamphetamines. The complaint further alleges that the court found that B.H. needed to be placed in his mother's care until he was released from prison. The court also found that the defendant had shown very minimal compliance throughout the case and had failed to comply with the case plan and court orders.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he had been incarcerated on at least six separate occasions, stemming in large part from his drug addiction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 9-27-341 and 10e-3 of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The final judgment also prohibits Blackwood from serving as an officer or director of a public agency and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service.  On May 12, 2017, the court entered a temporary restraining order against Blackwood and ordered him to return to the home where he was incarcerated. The order also prohibits him from associating with any person with a history of drug or alcohol-related criminal conduct.  A hearing on June 30, 2018, was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Eastern time for Blackwood to respond to a question about whether he would participate in an adoptive home study conducted by the agency's caseworker. The hearing was conducted in the absence of any evidence to support the court's finding of potential harm to the child. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Arkansas Division of Criminal Justice. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Arkansas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
