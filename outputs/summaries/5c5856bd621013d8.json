  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against convicted felon Torico Jackson for failing to object to the admission of false police reports concerning two prior burglaries at his Atlanta home.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, in 2004, Jackson was sentenced as a recidivist to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for a second time for a prior felony.  According to the complaint, Jackson, who was a paralegal at the time of the second burglary, told his friend that he had been spending time with Jackson recently, and that, while he had recently been spending some time with him, a background check had revealed that Jackson had a history of self-incrimination.  Jackson also allegedly told his girlfriend that a scar on his nose came from an accident in which he had flipped a car.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Jackson failed to inform the jury of his failure to come forward with information about the murder.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Jackson's failure to object violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rules 206(3) and 206 (4)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Jackson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, prejudgment interest of $2,077.71 and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The judgment also orders Jackson to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Additionally, Jackson has agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, other than for the purpose of recovering stolen property from a previously-convicted felon.  On June 20, 2011, the court granted Jackson's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest in a future criminal trial.  To settle the SEC case, Jackson agreed to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  He also agreed to the appointment of a receiver and to the payment of a $25,000 penalty. "
