  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas today entered final judgments against Lauren C., a Lewisville, Texas resident, against the District of Columbia for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that Lauren C. was not a prevailing party under the federal education law when she was diagnosed with autism at the end of the 2015-16 school year.  According to the complaint, Lauren's mother and stepfather disagreed with the district\u2019s finding that Lauren had been diagnosed with both autism and intellectual disability and that the district had failed to provide her with an appropriate IEP.  In its judgment, the court found that the District had violated Child Find and provided Lauren with an IEP that did not meet the diagnostic criteria for her disability.   The court also ruled that, based on the evidence presented, Lauren was not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees under the IEP because she had aged out of eligibility for special education services at the time of the district court decision.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Lauren consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and requires her to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years.  Lauren also agreed to a five-year officer-director bar and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  On June 29, 2017, the SEC granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Lauren, and ordered her to comply with the court order.  As set forth in the order, Lauren has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a court-ordered injunction and to the appointment of an administrative hearing officer to determine whether she is entitled to attorney's fees.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (January 24, 2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Education, with litigation assistance from Eric R. Werner, and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Department of Education and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
