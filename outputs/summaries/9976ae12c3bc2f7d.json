  "summary": "On March 20, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against Google, Inc., a cloud storage and computing services company, from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, in September 2019, Google, through its subsidiary, G Suite, offered to acquire, offer, and sell enterprise customer data held by three individuals and entities who may be involved in the very conduct under investigation. The complaint alleges that the G Suite warrant was narrowly tailored to protect a compelling Government interest and to prevent premature disclosure of the existence of the warrant and the specific accounts being investigated.  According to the complaint, the court granted the injunction on September 19, 2019.  In a parallel action, on March 21, 2020, the United States District Judge in Manhattan granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, Google and G Suite consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(e) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and orders G Suite to comply with the court order.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, and the FBI.  For further information, see Press Release No. 17-mc-478 (January 1, 2017).  The litigation will be led by Mr. Dolan and Mr. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and Carol S. Cotter of the Chicago Regional Office, with assistance from Eric Werner of the Division of Homeland Security's Office of Public Affairs. The litigation is being led by Jennifer C. McKinley and Glenn S. Gordon of the Boston Regional Office."
