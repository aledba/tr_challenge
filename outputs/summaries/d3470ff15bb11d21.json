  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was found guilty of first-degree murder for orchestrating a double-murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that on May 7, 2011, Randy Steven Cagle entered a guilty plea by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $15,000.  Cagle agreed to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  In its order, the court also ordered Cagle to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $20,000, which would be equal to the amount Cagle was ordered to pay.  Without admitting to the SEC's findings, Cagle consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 15a-1443 of the Exchange Act, and ordering him to disgorge $20.00 in prejudgment interests, pay $1,000 in civil penalties, and pay a $15.00 civil penalty.  On June 28, 2018, the SEC filed a Rule 24 complaint against Cagle, alleging that the trial court erred when it did not consider Cagle\u2019s request for a special jury instruction on premeditation and deliberation, and failed to intervene when the jury deliberated for more than an hour after the trial ended. The SEC also charged Cagle with violating Section 10(b) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and charged him with aiding and abetting Cagle in his scheme to commit the double murder of two of his co-defendants. Cagle has agreed to settle the SEC action by agreeing to a permanent injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of the proceeds of the alleged double murder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about pre-judgment judgments, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (1962).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit."
