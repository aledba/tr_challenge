  "summary": "On August 1, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment against Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (\"Ocwen\"), a Florida-based servicer, for its alleged violation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and its implementing regulation, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 2605(k).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on June 8, 2016 in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County, Florida, the servicer failed to respond to an investor's request for a phone number for the owner or assignee of a mortgage loan.  The complaint alleges that, in its response to the investor's application for a call to the phone number, Defendants failed to provide a sufficient response.  In a parallel action, on August 19, 2017, the SEC filed an emergency action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On August 24, 2016 the SEC issued an order granting the SEC a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of all defendants, and imposing a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court also granted the SEC an emergency court order, ordering the resumption of the litigation, and ordering the payment of civil penalties.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David M. McLean and Eric R. Werner of the Miami Regional Office, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Banking and Securities."
