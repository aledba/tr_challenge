  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Anthony Corona, a convicted felon who was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in a 2015 carjacking that resulted in the death of a drug dealer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Corona and his accomplices arranged to rob Victim in a church parking lot under the guise of a legitimate drug deal.  According to the complaint, Corona told the group that he had a gun and that he was going to use it to commit the felony discharge of a firearm.  As alleged, however, Corona did not have the gun.  Instead, the complaint alleges, Corona allegedly used the gun to commit a series of unrelated criminal acts, including a carjack, a car chase, and an attempted robbery.  In a parallel action, the Utah Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Corona, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Corona has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Mascianica of the Utah Court of Appeals granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Corona to comply with the court order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC case, Corona has consented to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a temporary officer-and-director bar against him from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Salt Lake Police Department, Utah Bureau of Criminal Investigation, and the Utah State Office of Criminal Investigations in this matter."
