  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered final judgments against CSL Plasma, Inc., a Texas-based plasma collection center, and its owner, Mark Silguero, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, alleges that CSL violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, CSL's conduct violated Section 121.003(b)(2)(A)(i) and Section 12182(B)(3)(B).  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against SilGuero and Wolfe, alleging that the defendants violated the federal anti-fraud provision of the Exchange Act by failing to provide reasonable accommodations in policies, practices, and procedures to prevent or discourage a person with a disability from using or being admitted to a public facility.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of CSL, and ordering the company to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Health and Human Services, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
