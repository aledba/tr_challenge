  "summary": "On October 16, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Ambac Assurance Corporation (Ambac), a financial-guaranty, or monoline, insurer that guaranteed payments on certain residential mortgage backed securities issued by defendant Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. and its affiliated entities.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, Ambac's complaint alleged that between 2004 and 2006, Countrywide fraudulently induced Ambac to enter into agreements to insure RMBS transactions, including by signing a confidentiality agreement that required the parties to work together on several pre-closing issues, including maintaining employee benefit plans, consulting on state and federal tax consequences, and securing the appropriate merger approvals and consents of third parties and regulators.  The court also ruled that the privilege was \"considerably narrower\" than the \"attorney-client privilege\" and that it was \"unnecessary that there be any litigation in the shadow of litigation.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced that it filed a parallel criminal action against Bank of America Corp. (BAC), alleging that BAC would be liable for any judgment as Countrywide's successor-in-interest when the parties agreed to a joint proxy and registration statement that would serve both to obtain CFC shareholder approval of the merger and to allow BAC to register its shares with the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, BAC consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, with a civil penalty of $100,000, and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  In its order, the court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of BAC and CFC, and ordering them to provide an accounting of the losses arising from the alleged misconduct.  On November 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against BAC, alleging that it violated the common interest privilege, and requiring it to comply with the requirements of the federal securities laws. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the New York office. The litigation will be led by Elisha L. Frank. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson."
