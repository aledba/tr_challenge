  "summary": "On August 15, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the company's motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing assets, and ordering the company to pay a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that EveryWare Global, Inc., an Ohio-based manufacturing company, and its co-founders, Brent Rock, Casey Parsons, Daniel Taylor, and Samie Solomon, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the company was under no obligation to rehire an employee following the filing of an EEOC complaint and instead, hired substantially younger, less qualified applicants.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the company had not previously pled a retaliation claim based on a conditional offer of employment that was never prosecuted and never met any standard for an injunction at all.   The complaint also alleges that defendants failed to provide reasonable and fair notice as to why an employee would not be rehired.  For example, the SEC alleges that in one instance, a former supervisor at a manufacturing plant in Ohio was not retained by the company and instead sought to retain her as a supervisor.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, EveryWare has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay civil penalties in the amount of $20 million, $10 million in disgorgement, and $1 million in prejudgment interest. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit in the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Darrell Bresler. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office, and the Ohio Attorney General's Office in this matter."
