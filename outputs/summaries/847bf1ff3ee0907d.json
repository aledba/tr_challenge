  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against a defendant who lost a case in federal court in Taos, New Mexico.  According to the court's order, filed on September 29, 2016, Kerry Kruskal filed a motion for reconsideration of a court order that had issued a temporary restraining order against him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court granted the motion, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to the relief request.  In its order, the court ruled that the motion to reconsider should be deemed satisfied by the facts presented in the case and that the court should consider the merits of the motion.  As the court previously ruled, however, that there was no reasonable reliance on the prior court's judgment and that it should not impose any additional burden on the party opposing the request. The court also ruled that, in a parallel action, the defendant should have the right to reapply after twenty-eight days from the date the court issued its order.  Without admitting to these facts, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, a civil injunctive relief order, and an officer-and-director bar.  For further information, see Servants of the Paraclete v. Dixon, 204 F.3d (10th Cir. 1997).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Albuquerque, N.M. on August 30, 2016 and unsealed on August 31, 2018, charges the defendants with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The complaint also charges the defendant with violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and seeks a preliminary injunction against further violations of Rule 60(b)(6).  In a parallel administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted a parallel criminal investigation, which was conducted by David Amar, Richard D. Freer, Helen Hershkoff, and Catherine T. Struve of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller, Edward H. Cooper, and Vikram David Amar. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor"
