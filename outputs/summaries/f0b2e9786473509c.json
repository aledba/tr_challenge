  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Wyoming today announced criminal charges against a Wyoming-based OB/GYN accused of sexually assaulting two of his patients.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, alleges that Paul Michael Harnetty violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he violated the pre-trial registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(v).  The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the representations of the SEC, Dr. HarnETty was in a position of authority over a patient.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that he did not engage in any form of sexual conduct with the patient, and instead used his thumb to \"rub[\u2009] [her] clitoris back and forth\u201d for around three to four minutes.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, he consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 25, 2019, entered an order granting the SEC preliminary and permanent injunctions against further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws.  On February 26, 2019 the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction against further violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged conduct of the alleged victims.  It also seeks an officer-and-director bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and an officer and director bar against any association with the broker-dealer, municipal securities dealer, broker dealer, or investment adviser.  Finally, the SEC is seeking a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14, ordering a hearing on February 27, 2019 to determine whether to issue an order imposing an injunction, imposing a civil monetary penalty, and ordering an accounting of alleged violations of Rule 12b-20.  A hearing is scheduled for March 20, 2019.   The case is being handled by David A. Cohen, John R. Rymas, and Amy Gwiazda of the Denver Regional Office."
