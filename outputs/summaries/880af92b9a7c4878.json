  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut on March 27, 2014 entered a final judgment against Bloomberg L.P., a purported hedge fund based in the Netherlands, and two of its senior officers for defrauding investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, from 2011 through 2014, former hedge fund manager Dan Friedman induced his employer, Palladyne International Asset Management, to pay him $500 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The complaint also alleges that the defendants made numerous misrepresentations to Friedman regarding the nature of the alleged extortion, including that Friedman had \"repeated tried to extort money from the company\" and that he had been fired for engaging in a \"kickback and money laundering operation for the former dictatorial Ghaddafi [sic] regime in Libya.\"  The complaint further alleges that Friedman told a colleague that he was \"dismissed for gross misconduct\" because he was seeking an amount \"far in excess of the appraised value\" of the property.  According to the complaint, the complaint also alleged that, over the course of nearly eight months, the defendants repeatedly tried to extract money from Friedman.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Friedman consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $499,401, plus interest and a $250,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 25, 2014, the Honorable Judge Robert D. Sack granted Friedman's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, which he has already paid in the form of a civil monetary penalty, to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC. The court also granted Friedman the opportunity to apply for a preliminary injunction, which requires him to comply with the court's order, and to provide for an accounting of the amount of his alleged losses. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
