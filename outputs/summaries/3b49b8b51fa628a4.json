  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky yesterday entered a final judgment against Gary O. Thompson, a Kentucky-based engineer and land surveyor, for damages arising from repairs McCoy made to Rockhouse Fork on Cherokee Creek and the county road running beside it. Thompson alleges the repairs caused his land to flood and erode. On realizing surrounding landowners may have assisted McCoy, Thompson sought and was granted leave to amend the complaint to add the addition of a third defendant.  The final judgment, which was entered without a jury, permanently enjoins Thompson from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) of 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $2,700 in disgorgement and $160,000 in prejudgment interest and a $1,500 civil penalty.  On May 2, 2018, the court entered a written judgment against Thompson, ordering him to return the property to its original location.  In a parallel action, on June 20, 2014, a federal district court in Kentucky granted Thompson a temporary restraining order and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  According to the SEC's order, filed in federal court in Lawrence, Kentucky, Thompson failed to prove all of his claims, including that he did not oppose the court visiting the farm because he thought it was \"for the purpose stated in Keeney v. Commonwealth, Dep't of Highways, 1940.\"  The SEC's complaint charges Thompson with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against Thompson.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Thompson consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any such judgment.   The court also ordered Thompson to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of restitution he will be ordered to pay.  Thompson also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be restrained from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, municipal advisor, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  To settle the case, Thompson agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to a $10,000 civil penalty, and he agreed to the appointment of a receiver and a receiver"
