  "summary": "On January 22, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against Westlake Services LLC, a California-based registered representative and broker-dealer, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1632 of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Alfredo Ramos purchased an automobile from Pena's Motors in July 2011.  According to the complaint, the car was purchased primarily in Spanish and a copy of the arbitration agreement contained in the contract was not provided to Ramos.  As alleged, the complaint further alleges that when confronted by one of the dealership's employees, who spoke in his native tongue, Ramos replied, \"I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I'm signing this contract.\"  The complaint also alleges that Westlake failed to provide Ramos with a translation of an arbitration agreement that included the arbitration provision.  In a parallel action, on November 14, 2013, a federal district court in California granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze against Ramos and ordered him to sign a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and requires him to comply with a court order requiring him to show cause and effect in the case of an injunction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Westlake agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the charged provisions, ordering a permanent injunction, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against Ramos. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On January 24, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action against Ramos, charging him with violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (\"CFPA\") Rules of Practice and Rules of Order, and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay civil penalties of $150,000 and a $50,000 penalty, and pay a $20,000 officer and director bar. The SEC also issued an order requiring Ramos to provide an accounting of his purchase of the car and to provide proof of his receipt of the purchase of a car.  Last week, the court granted the court's motion to compel arbitration of Ramos's claims against the CFPA, finding that he had not signed the contract, that he did not have the requisite knowledge and experience to determine whether it was valid, and that he was entitled to an injunction against future violations. The court also denied the request for a civil injunction, ordering Ramos to pay disgorgement of $1,038,"
