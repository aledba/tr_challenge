  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against ProTemp Staffing Solutions, Inc. (\"ProTemp\"), a Louisiana-based company that provides temporary workers' compensation insurance.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 9, 2015, Carey Dorsey, while employed by ProTemp, claimed that he injured his neck and back on September 21, 2011 while attempting to open a panel on a \"chipper,\" which was subsequently engaged and jerked his body.  The complaint alleges that, at the time of the alleged injury, Dorsey was being loaned to defendant, Boise Cascade Company (\"Boise Cascade\"), to perform work as a temporary employee to pay past or future weekly benefits, as well as medical benefits, whether or not the bills had been submitted to the employer.

Additionally, the settlement agreement provides for a six-month waiting period for a judgment ordering the parties to pay a penalty in accordance with the terms of the settlement, which is fair and equitable, with benefits, penalties, and attorney fees to be determined by the court upon motion by the parties.  On November 16, 2016, a federal judge in New Orleans granted a temporary restraining order against Dorsey and ordered him to sign a settlement agreement that included a provision requiring him to show cause and effect of a court order appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the receiver.  Dorsey agreed to the appointment of a receiver and to the issuance of a cease-and-desist order, which requires him to submit a written statement to the receiver stating that he has satisfied all of the requirements of the federal securities laws, including the right to a hearing and to a jury trial.   The receiver also agreed to a cease and desist order and to pay"
