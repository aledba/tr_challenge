  "summary": "On June 29, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found to be gravely disabled by a court order appointing a conservator of his person and estate pursuant to Section 5350 of the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS Act) and imposing certain special disabilities.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, California, Michael Elmer, a self-described \"mental health and substance abuse expert,\" and his friend, James Holden, both of whom were also charged by the court with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the LPS Act.  The complaint alleges that, while Elmer was on his medication, he continued to experience auditory hallucinations, which he described as being \"just pissed-off white kids\" who were trying to steal his food, shelter, and clothing.  Elmer also allegedly told the court that he would not allow illegal drugs in his home and would lock up his alcohol.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this did not support the court's finding that Elmer had a mental illness and was incapable of providing for his basic needs.  In addition, Elmer allegedly had a history of schizophrenia and had been diagnosed during his most recent hospitalization with bipolar disorder, and had previously been diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, bipolar type.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and imposes an officer-and-director bar.  On July 15, 2016, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Elmer from further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws and ordered him to comply with the order appointing the conservator.  After a hearing on July 16, 2018, the Court granted the request for an emergency court order and appointed Holden as the public guardian of appellant's person, estate, and residence.  At the hearing, Holden also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be prohibited from associating with any person with a mental health or substance abuse disorder.  He also agreed not to participate in the offering of any medication, except for those that he believed would help him overcome his mental illness.  Finally, Holden agreed to the appointment of an independent public guardian, which is subject to court approval."
