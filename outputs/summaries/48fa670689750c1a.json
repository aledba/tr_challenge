  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Ohio today announced charges against a former assistant prosecuting attorney for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ohio, alleges that on April 5, 2017, the Mahoning County Prosecutor's Office improperly appointed Matthew E. Meyer as an independent special prosecutor in response to a complaint by a former colleague who alleged misconduct by the prosecutor's office.  According to the complaint, Meyer agreed to the appointment of a special prosecutor based on a finding that he had a conflict of interest in unsealing the grand jury transcripts.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced that it would unseal the transcripts of five criminal cases related to Gains's misconduct.  On June 4, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for access to the transcripts, finding that Meyer had a \"special need\" for the transcripts because he was subject to discharge by Gains, and therefore could not independently investigate those claims.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the attorney general's office agreed with the court that the transcripts were necessary to preserve the secrecy of the criminal proceedings, and that Gains had a duty to protect the integrity of the justice system.  As a result of the court's finding, Gains was not entitled to a fair trial, and he was not required to participate in the in-camera review of the transcripts that was conducted by the trial court.  Additionally, the judge who appointed Meyer as special prosecutor found that he lacked standing to represent the interests of the state in the criminal cases he was prosecuting, and appointed Meyer to represent Gains as independent special counsel.   The court also found that, based on the nature of the misconduct alleged in the federal case, Meyer could not be trusted to independently investigate the alleged misconduct that he reported to the prosecutor.  Finally, the Court found that the assistant prosecutor's conduct was not sufficient to justify her termination, and instead appointed Matthew Meyer as her independent counsel, despite his repeated requests to do so.  For further information, see Litigation Release Order No. 5, 2018-Ohio-1087, July 17, 2018 (2d Dist.).  The Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about potential fraud in the securities industry.
