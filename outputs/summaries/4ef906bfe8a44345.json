  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a Texas man who was found guilty of a lesser-included offense of burglary of a habitation.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on August 8, 2015, in Hays County, Texas, Brandon DeLeon, a convicted felon, entered a building without the effective consent of the owner and stole a firearm. The complaint alleges that DeLeon entered the building with the intent to steal the stolen property and entered the habitation without the owner's knowledge or consent. The SEC alleges that, as alleged in the indictment, DeLeon violated the antifraud provisions of Section 30(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 30b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Deleon consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,500. The court also ordered DeLeon to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $2,500, and ordered him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Houston office by John R. Rymas. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Mr. Barry and Ms. Basinger. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Attorney General's Office, and the Texas Department of Criminal Justice."
