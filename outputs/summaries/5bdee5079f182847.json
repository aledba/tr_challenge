  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Daniel Heath Kight, a convicted felon who was sentenced to life imprisonment without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence for the second degree murder of David Scasino (\u201cScasino\u201d).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Vinton, Louisiana on March 26, 2018, alleges that Kight was a victim of the mandatory minimum sentence imposed by the Louisiana legislature in 2014.  According to the complaint, Kight had a long history of substance abuse, was bipolar, schizophrenic, and off his psychiatric medication, and had a history of drug-related psychosis.  Kight allegedly told a 9-1-1 dispatcher that he would kill his victim and rip his genitalia off.  The complaint further alleges that he claimed to know right from wrong at the time of the crime and that he had smoked weed, gotten mad at the caller, and caused the victim to lose his entire head.

To determine whether Kight is entitled to a downward departure from the mandatory sentence, a judge or jury must determine whether he has met the burden of proof required by the federal law.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-1052 (January 24, 2019).  In the alternative, the Court found Kight liable for violating the mandatory sentencing provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(B) of"
