The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Michael Tyndall, a former officer with the department, was involved in an undercover operation in which he purchased and sold cocaine from James Williams. According to the complaint, Williams agreed to pay $1,200.00 for the purchase of one ounce of cocaine from Williams at a Bojangles restaurant in Warsaw.

The Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered the destruction of any evidence, and issued an order appointing a receiver to determine the amount of money to be distributed to the receiver, and ordered the receiver to disgorge any ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and pay a civil penalty of $2,500. The receiver also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to pay a $100,000 civil penalty.  Finally, the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 15(e) of"
