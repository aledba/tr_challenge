  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Utah-based power company MWF, Inc. and its subsidiary, Monticello Wind Farm, LLC (MWF), for failing to comply with a Commission order requiring MWF to purchase power from qualifying power producers.  According to the SEC's order, MWF and MWF entered into a power purchase agreement that required them to pay a price that was not consistent with the Commission's methodology for calculating avoided costs.  The SEC alleges that MWF failed to show that the pricing was consistent with what the Commission had determined, and that it had a right to enter into an agreement with MWF that did not exceed the avoided costs contained in the agreement.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission\u2019s order, the SEC charged MWF with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the books and records provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Utah today announced criminal charges against MWF.  MWF has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Scott A. Birkenheier and Glenn S. Gordon. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Utah Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Utah Secretary of State's Office, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Justice and the Utah Office of Financial Regulation."
