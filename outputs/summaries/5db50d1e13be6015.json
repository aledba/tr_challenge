  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio on June 24, 2015 entered a final judgment against Russell N. Fazekas, Jr., a former Wood County Prosecutor, for preindictment delay in connection with the death of Dana M. Rosendale.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, on September 5, 1982, Rosendale's body was found by emergency medical personnel in a trailer park near Tracey Road, Ohio. The complaint alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, the victim suffered severe head trauma, including severe head injuries, and that she fell out of a moving car.  The complaint further alleges that Rosendale was not beaten to death with a blunt force trauma, but rather fell from the passenger side of the car and hit her head on the back of the head.  In addition, the complaint alleges Rosendale did not fall out of her car and was not hit by a single blow.  As alleged, the evidence presented at the second trial, which was conducted by Robert Bratton, was not consistent with the findings of the first trial, and the jury found Rosendale not guilty of the charges.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Rosendale to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest.  On August 18, 2016, the Court granted the request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the unsealing of the case against Rosendale, who was later convicted of the same charges. The court also granted the application for a final injunction against further violations of Section 15 of the Exchange Act.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019).  The SEC&rdquo:  The case is being handled by John R. Higgins, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations, with assistance from Joseph G. Sansone, Assistant Director of the Office of Public Health, and Senior Trial Counsel. The case has been supervised by Gregory A. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio State Attorney General's Office, the FBI and the Ohio Department of Criminal Justice."
