  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against Bribiesca for her alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Wichita, Kansas, alleges that, from at least June 2015 through September 2016, Bribieca moved from her first apartment, unit 1812, to another apartment in Aspen Park Apartments (Aspen), Kansas, where she resided for a term from January 9, 2016 through September 30, 2016. The complaint alleges that she received a lease renewal offer on August 31, 2016, that was not subject to the required 30-day notice to vacate, and that Case failed to return her pet deposit after she left the apartment.  According to the complaint, after she moved in, she found numerous problems in her apartment, including a dryer vent that did not vent to the outside of the apartment, and a boiler room that had not been cleaned in years.  She also found that the boiler room had been replaced with a new boiler room.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against her for her role in the alleged scheme.  Bribiedca agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint and to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,038, which is equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties of $2,037, and $965, respectively. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kansas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kansas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
