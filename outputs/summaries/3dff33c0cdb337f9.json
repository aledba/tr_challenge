  "summary": "On February 26, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi entered a final judgment against the defendants in a medical malpractice action brought by two medical providers in Hinds County and Leake County.  The court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other relief.  According to the court's order, the defendants agreed to settle the litigation without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against one of the medical providers involved in the alleged malpractice. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that defendants were liable for the injunctive relief that the court granted to the other defendants. The court also granted the parties' requests to appoint a receiver to determine the appropriate venue for a civil action brought in the county where the complaint was filed against them.  On March 11, 2013, Dianne Harkins arrived at the Mississippi Baptist Medical Center emergency room at approximately 3:50 p.m. and complained of right flank pain. Approximately 10 minutes later, Dr. Moody saw her at approximately 10:50 a.m., and he ordered her to be transferred via air ambulance. Approximately one hour later, she was admitted to the hospital. Approximately two hours later, the emergency-room physician entered a judgment ordering him to consent to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws. The judgment also ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mississippi Department of Insurance, and the Mississippi State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
