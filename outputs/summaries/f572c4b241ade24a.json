  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Montana today entered a final judgment against a Montana-based insurance company for defrauding its insureds.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Montana, alleges that, in 2004, Larry Addink advised his clients that they could structure a sale of real estate to their advantage as a tax-deferred exchange pursuant to Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 1031.  According to the complaint, Addink and his firm, Draggin\u2019 Y Cattle Company, Inc., raised the issue of whether to enter into a stipulated settlement without the consent or participation of the insurer, and failed to do so in the event of an excess judgment.  In addition, the complaint alleges that New York Marine failed to inform the Peterses that the transaction could not be deferred because of new tax rulings that had changed the law on related parties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $2.5 million, prejudgment interest of $1.8 million, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  New York has agreed to settle the case against it by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, and to pay civil penalties of $50,000 and $50 million, respectively.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-20. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of overcharging for insurance coverage.
