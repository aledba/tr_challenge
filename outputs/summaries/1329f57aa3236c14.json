  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of Maryland-based ConAgra Brands, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Conagra Foods, Inc.  The Court of Appeals previously issued an order requiring the company to pay $2.7 million in back taxes, interest, and penalties for the years 1996 through 2003.  According to the Court's order, the company and its subsidiaries violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order or finding that the company or its subsidiaries lacked economic substance as a business entity separate from the parent company, the court also found that the companies and their subsidiaries did not have any meaningful substance as business entities separate from their parent companies.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Maryland today announced criminal charges against the company.  On March 17, 2015, the Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the company's assets and liabilities, and entered a default judgment against the defendants, ordering them to pay disgorgement of $2,768,588, plus prejudgment interest of $1,078, and a civil penalty of $160,000.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Eric R. Gore and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Maryland Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, the Maryland Secretary of State's Office and the Maryland Attorney General's Office in this matter."
