  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a California-based automotive service expert for breach of warranty under the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, Jackie Winters purchased a BMW X5 automobile from a BMW dealership in August 2007.  The complaint alleges that she experienced several problems with the car and drove it to a dealership for warranty service on several occasions.  In one instance, the complaint alleged that the car's engine noises indicated that the engine was defective and required replacement.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the car never had any performance problems and did not have any problems with its driving performance.  On one occasion, Winters allegedly complained that she heard engine noises when accelerating at high speeds and a different sound coming from the engine.  She also alleged that one of the engine parts was peeling, so the car was replaced with a different type of drive wheel cover.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's judgment, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of Section 1790 of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $4,500.  Winters also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a company or entity that provides security deposit for the security deposit.  Finally, the court entered a judgment against Winters that permanently enjoins her from violating these provisions and orders her to return to the dealership and pay a penalty equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Marc Blau and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the Los Angeles Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Blau.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
