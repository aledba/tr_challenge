  "summary": "On June 7, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered judgment against Spartan Concrete Products, LLC, a bulk cement vendor, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 2(a) of the Robinson-Patman Act of 1940.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Spartan, which operated on St. Thomas and St. John, sought to displace a company called Heavy Materials, Corp., as the sole provider of ready-mix concrete on the island.  Spartan's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges that Spartan engaged in price discrimination by failing to provide sufficient evidence that it suffered antitrust injury.  According to the complaint, Spartan also failed to provide evidence that Heavy Materials caused its losses and eventual departure from the market.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Spartan.  On June 8, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint against Argos, alleging that Spartan violated the antitrust provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Spartan consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders it to pay disgorgement of $345,000 in prejudgment interest, and orders Spartan to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica and Mr. Dolan.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
