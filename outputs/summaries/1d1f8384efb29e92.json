  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California yesterday entered a final judgment against a California-based company and two former employees in a class action action alleging that it violated the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that, in 2010 and 2011, Erick Veliz and Sergio Perez of Seal Beach, LLC, served as customer service representatives for U.Haul Co. of California for various Labor Code violations, including unpaid overtime and meal break requirements.  According to the complaint, in 2012, Veliz filed a complaint with the SEC alleging that U-Haul violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that, as a condition of their employment, they had standing to bring a representative PAGA claim.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating these provisions.  In addition, the court granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and an injunction, and the parties agreed to settle the case by consenting to arbitration.  On September 22, 2014, the California Court of Appeal granted the parties' request for an emergency court order and issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent investigation into the alleged violations of the securities laws, including the securities registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  Separately, the Court granted the company's request for a court order requiring it to conduct independent, independent, and impartial audits of its compliance with the federal laws, and granted the companies' request to jointly and severally arbitrate the issues raised in the complaint.  Finally, on September 24, 2016, the SEC filed an emergency action against U. Haul, alleging that the company violated the antifraud provision of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(2) of its employment agreement, and ordering the company to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million.  U.\u00c2\u00a0Haul agreed to a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins the company from violating the federal, state, and local securities laws and orders it to pay civil penalties in a separate administrative proceeding.   In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office today announced criminal charges against the defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael R. Kasper and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office."
