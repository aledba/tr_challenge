  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Michael J. Appellant, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2013, ordering him to pay over $1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, from at least 2013 through at least 2016, Appelant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he failed to adequately disclose to the jury that he had a prior felony conviction for aggravated child molestation.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he was prejudiced by his trial counsel's failure to stipulate to the defendant's prior convictions for possession of a firearm and felony murder based on the evidence presented at trial.  According to the complaint, the jury deliberated for nearly two weeks before concluding that Appellants should have been found guilty.  On January 24, 2019, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule\u00c2\u00a0206(4)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and from violating the antigorgement provisions of Rule 206(3).  The court also granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, as well as an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation of the case.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-2049 (January 26, 2019).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney\u2019S Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Appelland.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office, and the case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  A hearing will be conducted by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Georgia Office of Criminal Justice, the FBI, the United States Attorney General, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Georgia Department of Justice in this matter."
