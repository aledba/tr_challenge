  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of Donald Hitzhusen, the decedent of the Iowa House of Representatives, ordering him to pay a $203,000 civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Des Moines, Iowa, alleges that, in 1997, Iowa passed a law that allowed the state to exempt stepchildren from inheritance taxes when their parent and stepparent were not married.  According to the complaint, this exemption was necessary to preserve the family relationship and preserve the value of the family unit.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the state could reasonably conclude that a tax exemption on the property of stepchildren would not recover a monopoly rent but would simply be passed along to the consumer in the form of higher prices.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Donald and Paula consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Paula and Mark agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 450.1 of the I.C.A. and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Paula and Mark also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations.  Mark and Paula also will be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and will be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of the public company or the company in which they are registered.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the Court of Common Pleas granted the estate's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the amount of their assets.  Julia C. McKinley, Chief of the Commission on Economic and Risk Analysis, has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of inheritance tax fraud.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to identify whether they are professionals."
