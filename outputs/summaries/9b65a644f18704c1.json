  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Mark Curry for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, alleges that, from at least 2014 to 2018, Curry and his entities engaged in a fraudulent scheme to defraud the Otoe-Missouria Indian Tribe of Oklahoma.  According to the complaint, from 2014 through 2018, the Tribe and Curry made numerous misrepresentations to the court concerning the nature of the Tribe's sovereign immunity, including that the Tribe had no legitimate interest in granting it the right to self-governance and a safe treasury.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2014 and 2018, when the Tribe entered default on its loan to a member of the tribe, Curry shifted all of the risk of his scheme to the tribe and kept the lion's share of the revenue for himself, through a scheme that infringed upon the Tribe&rsquo;s self-government and put the tribe's treasury at risk.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits, and orders the Tribe to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On March 9, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Curry and the entities he controls, and ordered the court to consider the merits of the case.   The court also issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the collection and processing of any claims arising from the alleged fraud. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oklahoma Secretary of State's Office, and the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office in this matter."
