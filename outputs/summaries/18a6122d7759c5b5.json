  "summary": "On December 11, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against Harrison Capel, a medically retired former Navy SEAL, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Charlotte, North Carolina, Capel learned that her husband had died unexpectedly.  The complaint alleges that Capel engaged in a multi-year \"shameful and unjust ruse\" whereby she hid the fact (if true) that she had never been divorced from her husband, and that she was forced to pay inordinate sums of money over the last two years for alimony payments.  Capel's widow, Brooke Norman, filed a civil injunctive action in federal court against Capel.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Ms. Capel entered into a long-arm agreement with the federal government in 2014 that required her to make monthly payments to her husband and to maintain her status as a beneficiary of his life insurance until he had paid her \"her full alimony payment.\"  The SEC also alleges that, in a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina today announced parallel criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Harrison and Capel consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of $504,000, or $400,000 if paid in one lump sum, and ordering Capel to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Harrison also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the public company or by association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal bond dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-11-2017."
