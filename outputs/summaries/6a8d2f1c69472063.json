  "summary": "On February 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of a Nebraska-based insurance company in a civil action brought by an insurance company seeking to bar it from participating in the sale, purchase, offer, or sale of any type of insurance.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Omaha, Nebraska, alleges that, beginning in 2013, Applied Underwriters, Inc. (AUCRA) and its affiliates, Continental Indemnity Company, Inc., and California Insurance Company (California), violated the antifraud provisions of Section 25(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 25b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that AUCRA violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b2-1 thereunder, and that, in violation of Section 5, Milmar violated Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of Exchange Act Rules 5(b) and (c) thereunder and Section 5. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating Exchange Act Rule 5a-14, ordering them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and ordering a temporary restraining order against Milmar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Nebraska today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged scheme. The SEC also announced related civil injunctions against certain defendants.  Among other things, the SEC is seeking a court-ordered injunction, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the amount of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest paid to the defendants, as well as an injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws. In addition, the court has issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to proceed with the settlement of the litigation.  On March 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the Federal Bureau of Investigation entered final judgments against all defendants in this matter. The court's order issued on March 22, 2019 permanently enjoins the defendants from violating Section 5 and orders them to comply with the court orders. The order also orders the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC is continuing to investigate the matter of whether or not to issue a civil injunctive relief. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Mr. Barry and Ms. Burt of the SEC."
