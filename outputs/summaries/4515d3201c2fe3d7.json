  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two men who were convicted of aiding and abetting an aggravated credit union robbery.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that Walter Jordan, III and Johnathon Nico Wise, both of Houston, aided and abetted the robbery of the First Community Credit Union in July 2017. The complaint alleges that Jordan was present during the robbery when the three men entered the credit union and demanded that the teller get out of the car. According to the complaint, Jordan and Wise then followed Jordan and his brother, Deandre Santee, who was also a co-defendant in the robbery. Jordan and Santee allegedly used a Tundra and a Nissan Rogue to steal approximately $1.5 million in cash from the bank. The SEC alleges that the two men were not present when the robbery took place, and that Jordan had no prior knowledge that a firearm would be used in the crime. The court also found that Jordan and Loring were not responsible for the robbery because Jordan had cooperated with the government in its investigation of the case. Jordan has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Jordan. The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Criminal Division of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by David Helms and supervised by Amy C. McKinley.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Houston Police Department, the FBI, and the Texas State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
