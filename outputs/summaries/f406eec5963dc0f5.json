  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Montana today entered a final judgment against Shawn L. Lesnik, the former Sheriff of Musselshell County, Montana, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13-15-206 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13-16-302 thereunder.  The court granted Lesnik\u2019s motion for an emergency court-ordered recount on December 21, 2018.  According to the court order, filed in the District Court on December 6, 2018, Lesnik filed an emergency motion to intervene and halt the recount.  In its order, the court found that Lesnik had failed to serve his petition on the County and agreed to procedures and parameters for the recount that were not consistent with the requirements of the federal election laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Court also found Lesnik liable for attorney fees under the private attorney general doctrine.  Lesnik has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his legal fees.  On December 19, the district court entered an order granting or denying Lesnik the right to participate in a recount without being required to post a bond for the costs of the recount, which would have required Lesnik to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $500,000 penalty.    The Court also granted the Commission on Audit and Rulemaking the Commission's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order to prevent Lesnik from participating in the recount and ordering the Commission to conduct a preliminary injunction and order a show cause hearing for December 7, 2018 to determine whether to award Lesnik reasonable attorney fees in the future. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission also issued an order suspending the recount pending final approval by the court of the Commission, which is subject to court approval.\u00c2\u00a0 The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner and Kurt L. Gottschall of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Montana Secretary of State's Office, and the Montana Office of Inspector General in this matter."
