  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California against the officers who conducted a Terry stop on a suspected drug dealer.  The court found that the officers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the court also held that the officer who conducted the Terry stop violated the reasonable-suspicion provision of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, the officers conducted the stop based on a tip from a known but unproven source, and that the tip was reliable because the officers did not have a reasonable suspicion that the individual was involved in a drug transaction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the officer and his brother consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the unreasonable searches and seizures provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and orders the officers to conduct a search of the individual\u2019s home and car.

The same day, the same court issued a stop-and-search order suspending Lopez from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security measure. The orders also ordered the officers not to search the car of a person who had recently purchased a gun, and to stop and frisk him.  Separately, the Court also issued a warrant for Lopez to remain in the house while the investigation was conducted by the unit's internal affairs staff.  It also ordered that Lopez be restrained and restrained from making any statements to the officers in the course of the investigation.  Finally, the order prohibits officers from conducting searches based on \"reasonable suspicion\" without reasonable cause, including with respect to whether a person has been previously arrested for a drug-trafficking crime, and from conducting an unreasonable search and seizure.
