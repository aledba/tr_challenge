  "summary": "On March 29, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants' motion for summary judgment against them.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that defendants failed to adequately allege that they engaged in a conspiracy to commit securities fraud in order to inflate the price of the company's stock to allow for successful stock offerings, to protect their own executive positions, or to enhance the value of their personal stock holding in the company.  According to the complaint, defendants also failed to allege that the defendants orchestrated the fraud, knew about it, or were severely reckless in not knowing about it.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against defendants Day, Anderson, and Huggins, who are also charged with violations of the securities registration provisions of Sections 13(a)(1) and 13(b)(2)(A) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13b2-1, and 13a-13 thereunder.  On May 19, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Day and Anderson, charging them with violating Section 13(e)(2) and (3) of The Exchange Act and Rule 13e-14 thereunder and aiding and abetting each defendant's violations of Section 1292 of the Exchange Act. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against Defendants from violating these provisions, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, sale, or promotion of any securities in violation of these provisions. In addition, the complaint seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order, an order appointing a receiver, and a court order requiring the receiver to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver.
