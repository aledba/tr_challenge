  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Hector Granados, a former TxDOT employee, for age discrimination based on his alleged participation in a scheme to unlawfully terminate another employee.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that Granados violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the SEC's findings, Granados was not required to show that he was discriminated against in order to obtain a right to be terminated, and that he had engaged in a pattern of misconduct that led to his termination.  According to the complaint, however, the jury found Granados liable for his termination because he failed to comply with the SEC\u2019s recommendation for him to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  In a parallel action, the Texas Department of Health and Human Services today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against Granados. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The case is being handled by San Antonio Regional Office staff under the supervision of John Rymas. The litigation will be led by Mr. Sansone and Ms. Monarrez. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
