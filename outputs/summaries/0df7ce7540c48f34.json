  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Kentucky yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of a Louisa, Kentucky man who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Louisa on May 24, 2016, alleges that, in 2015, Sergeant Stephen Wilburn of the Louisa City Police Department confronted Billy Collins, Jr., a former high school student who had been arrested for driving on a suspended license and disorderly conduct. According to the complaint, Collins refused to comply with officers\u2019 orders to use the Taser, and instead began screaming and cursing at Wilburn and others across the street. The complaint alleges that Wilburn then used his Taser to subdue Collins, who refused to cooperate with the officers and continued to scream and curse at the officers. The SEC alleges that the officers then used their Tasers on Collins, causing him to fall to the ground face down on the ground.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Missouri today announced criminal charges against Collins.  On May 26, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Wilburn, charging him with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Wilburn has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  Separately, the U. S. Attorney\u2018s Office For the Southern Division of Kentucky today announced related criminal charges.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Kelly. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kentucky State Police, and the Kentucky Office of the Inspector General in this matter."
