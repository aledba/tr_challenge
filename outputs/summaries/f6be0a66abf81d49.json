  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered summary judgment against Terrance McCoy, a self-described \"sex addict\" who nonetheless practiced internal medicine.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in 2003, the State Medical Board of Ohio suspended McCoy from practicing internal medicine because he had had an affair with a patient.  According to the complaint, Beattie told McCoy that she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and that she needed professional services to deal with her condition.  She also alleged that McCoy failed to refrain from engaging in sexual contact with her and failed to rebuke her sexual advances.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced that it has obtained a court order halting the suspension of McCoy's medical license for six months.  On April 10, 2017, the court granted the SEC's motion for summary judgment, which is subject to court approval, on the basis of the facts contained in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, McCoy consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $867,500 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The court's order also prohibits the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter or an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation of any claims of medical or mental misconduct arising from the conduct of a physician.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 170197.  Separately, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against McCoy. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gaunt. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio attorney general's office, the Federal Insurance Regulatory Commission, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
