  "summary": "On January 11, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Blayne Perez, a former officer of the New York Police Department who was charged with insider trading in the wake of an officer's arrest for insider trading.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Perez violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17(b)(2) thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of the fellow officer rule, Perez was arrested without a warrant for a nonfelony theft offense. The court found that Perez had probable cause to arrest him for the theft and that he had reasonable cause to remove items from the vehicle. The SEC also found that, contrary to Perez\u2019s claims, the officers had probable causes to arrest Perez.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New York today announced that it filed criminal charges against Perez, charging him with one count of insider trading, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Perez agreed to the entry of a final judgement that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders him not to participate in any future officer-involved criminal investigation. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On January 13, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Perez against Monico Valencia, a New York City Police Department officer who previously served as an officer-in-training in the Department of Justice Criminal Division's Asset Management Unit, charging Perez with securities fraud and with aiding and abetting a scheme to steal from at least two other officers. The Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered Perez to surrender his passport, and ordered him to return to New York to be registered as a resident of the District of Columbia. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Perez consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Exchange Act and Rule\u00c2\u00a017(a) and 10d-1 thereunder, ordering Perez to pay disgorgement of $10,000, and to be barred from the securities industry. Perez also agreed to be restrained from associating with any officer with whom he has a reasonable suspicion of involvement in a criminal matter. The order also prohibits him from participating in any officer-related criminal investigation"
