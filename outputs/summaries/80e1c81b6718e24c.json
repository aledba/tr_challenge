  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment finding that a Missouri school district violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cole County, Missouri, alleges that, on October 4, 2017, District of Columbia issued a statement of charges against Lehmann, alleging that she willfully and persistently violated and failed to comply with District policies IGBA-1 and GBCB, related to Programs with Disabilities and Staff Conduct.  According to the complaint, Lehmann failed to demonstrate that the policies were properly promulgated, contrary to the trial court\u2019s determination, and that she was not entitled to injunctive relief because she had not presented a signed copy of the policies to the district clerk.  In addition, the complaint alleges that District failed to show that it had complied with the requirements of \u00a7171.011, the federal district law that requires school districts to adopt rules and regulations.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, District consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement and prejudgment interest that Lehmann will pay in the future.  On January 16, 2018, the court granted Lehmann's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits her from violating the federal securities laws, and granted her the right to return her allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest.  A hearing scheduled for February 21, 2019, was scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Feb. 26, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Education, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, and the Missouri Office of Education in this matter."
