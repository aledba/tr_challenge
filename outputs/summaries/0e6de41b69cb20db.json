  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the SEC's motion for an asset freeze and other emergency relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that the SEC violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by improperly charging attorney's fees based on the number of hours that an attorney spent preparing and drafting an application for a Social Security benefit.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, the SEC did not consider the reasonable hours spent on preparing the application for the benefit of a court-ordered asset freeze.  Instead, the court found that the attorney spent only 2.5 hours researching and drafting the reply brief, which is nearly double the amount other attorneys spent researching the same issue.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's opinion, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $16,745.34, a $625.68 attorney's fee, and a $1,000 officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (Aug. 22, 2013).  The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On November 1, 2017, the Honorable Judge William G. Donnelly of the U. S. District court for New York entered a temporary restraining order against the SEC, ordering the SEC to conduct an independent investigation, and appointing a receiver to determine the appropriate amount of attorney fees to be paid to the SEC.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for October 22, 2018, for which the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York Office of the United States Attorney's Office."
