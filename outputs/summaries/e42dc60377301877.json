  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered final judgments against San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) and San Francisco Taxi Medallion Sales Pilot Program (Pilot Program).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, alleges that the SFMTA Board of Directors violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the San Francisco District Attorney's Office issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering the issuance of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the agency from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a $1,600 civil penalty.  The court's order, which is subject to court approval, also prohibits the issuance or sale of any medallion.  In a parallel action, the California Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has obtained an order appointing a receiver to oversee the issuance and sale of all taxi medallions in the state.  On March 28, 2010, the court granted the SEC's request for an emergency asset freeze and an asset freeze, and ordered the sale of the medallion to a private company or to a public company.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, San Francisco &ld.gov has agreed to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal and state securities laws, ordering the sale and issuance of an order suspending the issuance, purchase, offer and sell of any taxi medallion, and requiring the payment of a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The court also ordered the city to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the court. The settlement is pending final approval by the Court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Yesson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the California Office of Financial Regulation."
