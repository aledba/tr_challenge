  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against Owen Pe\u00f1a, Jr. of Carlsbad, N.M.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that Pe\u00f1a used a peer-to-peer, file-sharing network to access child pornography.  According to the complaint, Pe\u00f1a allegedly used a software program to detect and download child pornography from a shared folder. The complaint alleges that, for over five years, he used the program to access the images, which were then shared among others on the network.  Pe\u00f1a also allegedly shared the images with other users of the program, allowing other users to download the images.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico announced criminal charges against Pe\u00f1a based on the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On August 10, 2013, a federal district court in New Mexico found Pe\u00f1a guilty of eight counts of distribution of child pornography and ordered him to vacate all but one of the charges.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 30-6A-3(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, and 13b-20 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Separately, the court granted Pe\u00f1a's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from further violating the federal securities laws, and ordered Pe\u00f1a to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $15,000, which is equal to the amount that he has already paid in restitution to the victims of the alleged child pornography distribution. The court also issued an order suspending Pe\u00f1a from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert in computer forensics.
