  "summary": "On March 21, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Morris Zukerman, a New York City-based investment management firm, that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10 million.  The court also imposed a $25,000 civil penalty against Zekerman.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan on March 21 and unsealed on March 24, 2017 in Manhattan federal court, the court found that Zukman violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by lying to tax professionals working for him and falsely claiming that he could pay a substantial fine and should be ordered to pay the fine.  Zuker also allegedly failed to file several years\u2019 worth of tax returns for the trust despite the fact that the district court overestimated his net worth.  In a parallel action, on March 27, 2016, the United States District Court in Manhattan entered a judgment imposing a permanent injunction, imposing a civil monetary penalty, and imposing an officer-and-director bar.  On March 26, 2018, the Court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting, and a conduct-based injunction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge $30 million in ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering a civil penalties of up to $100,000.  Additionally, the judge agreed to the imposition of an officer and director bar, which is subject to court approval.  As a result of the court order, the amount of the civil monetary monetary penalty will be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 578, 578 (2d Cir. 2012).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
