  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Justin M. Hageman, a convicted felon who was sentenced to a total of 37 years in prison.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Hageman violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Hageman consented to the final judgment without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, and agreed to a 10-year prison term. The final judgment, which was entered on a joint-and-several-year basis, ordered Hageman to pay a penalty of 10 years to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hageman.  Hageman also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer and director bar. The court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-director bar.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Kathleen M. Burns of the U.N. Office for Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued an order suspending Hageman from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The order also temporarily suspended Hageman's right to reapply for a hearing scheduled for April 13, 2017.  A hearing for Hageman is scheduled for May 24, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 17-cv-01221. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Attorney General's Office, and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
