  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Wechem, Inc., a Louisiana-based chemical company, for violating the company's non-competition and non-solicitation provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, from October 2007 through May 2018, Will Evans was required to enter into a sales representative Exclusive Account Contract (the \"Exchange Agreement\") that prohibits him from soliciting or serving as an officer or director of a competitor of a company for a period of two years. According to the complaint, Evans agreed to the Exchange Agreement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint and to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from participating in any business or selling any products similar to those offered or sold by the company while he was employed. The judgment also prohibits Evans from directly or indirectly soliciting any WEChem customer, including but not limited to Momar, in the parishes where he is employed.  In addition, the court found that Evans was in breach of the Commission Agreement when, in August 2017, he resigned from the company as a result of a change in its commission policy for all of its sales representatives.  On October 11, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a preliminary injunction, against Evans, against him, and against the company for violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  To learn more about the Exchange Agreement, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.  This case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the New Orleans Regional Office and supervised by Eric Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner."
