  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Christopher M., her estranged husband and the father of three minor children, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that on December 7, 2018, all three of the minor children were interviewed at the Children's Advocacy Center by Illinois State Trooper Corrine Mead, who conducted the interviews. According to the complaint, the girls stated respondent touched them in their private areas and took baths with them. The complaint further alleged respondent walked in the bathroom and opened the curtain while they showered, even after they had requested him to leave. The SEC alleges that the girls reported feeling uncomfortable and unsafe while in respondent's custody. The court also found that respondent voluntarily agreed not to be a caretaker during the pending investigation and that the school should not release the children to respondent. In addition, the complaint alleges that respondent changed his mind and wanted visitation with his daughters, who are not covered by the hearsay provisions of the Domestic Violence Act of 1940.  In its order of protection, the court entered a temporary restraining order against respondent, reserving visitation until further orders of protection were issued, and prohibiting him from having any contact with the children.  On January 29, 2019, the federal district court for the southern district of Illinois entered the final judgment in favor of Christopher M. and ordered him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against him. The case was investigated by the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) and was supervised by Carla Jones, an assistant district attorney. The litigation will be led by Mr. Barragan and Ms. Jacobson and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
