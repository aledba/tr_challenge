  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two pharmaceutical companies for their alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Nashville, Tennessee, alleges that Tennessee-based pharmaceutical companies Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Sandoz Inc. (Sandoz) violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to adequately demonstrate that they were under threat of suffering an injury when, in fact, they were not.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 13(b)(2) and 13(a)(3) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, and that, in violation of Section 14(a), the Exchange Act, Sandoz and Momenta violated Section 15(a).  The complaint also alleges that, under the Sherman Act, defendants violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc.'s (\"Advisers\") Rule 206(3) and (4) under Exchange Advisers' Rules 206(8), 206 (9), and 207 (9) under Rule 206 (10) and 206 (11) thereunder; and, under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-2 thereunder of Exchange Advisors Rule 13a2-3.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  Additionally, the Court has granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, and granted the companies' request for a court-ordered injunction.  On March 21, 2017, the Honorable Judge Barbara M. Holmes granted the parties' requests for an emergency court order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million and $2 million, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Separately, on March 24, 2018, a federal district court in the District of Columbia issued an order granting the defendants a temporary asset freeze, ordering the companies to pay a $1 million civil penalty, and appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the alleged violations.   The court's order, which is subject to court approval, also prohibits the defendants from violating the securities registration provisions of Section"
