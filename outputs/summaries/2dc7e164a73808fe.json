  "summary": "On March 20, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi entered a final judgment against a Hattiesburg Police Department officer who was convicted of grand larceny.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on November 23, 2015, Officer Eric Mitcham, who was assigned to the department's Public Safety Division, conducted an unregistered search of a Chevrolet Tahoe that was reported stolen from a public Wendy's parking lot.  According to the complaint, Waldon told the officers that he rented the vehicle from David Wilson at the nearby Wendy's, and that he was going to use the vehicle to purchase marijuana.  As alleged, however, the complaint alleges that Waldon did not rent the vehicle because he was embarrassed about the reason he was at Neil's house and did not know where the person who made the call was located.  In addition, the SEC alleges that when questioned by OnStar about the location of the call, the officer stated that he had rented the Tahoe from an individual named David Wilson, but that Wilson did not give Waldon permission to use it.  OnStar's complaint charges Waldon with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and a $20,000 officer-and-director bar.  Waldon also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public safety agency for the rest of his life, and to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of the proceeds of a federal securities law enforcement action.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Office of Inspector General in this matter."
