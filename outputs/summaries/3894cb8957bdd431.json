  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against defendant Billy Ray Mangum, Jr. for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, Mangum was charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle and attaining habitual felon status.  The SEC alleges that Mangum agreed to the entry of a judgment that required him to pay attorney\u2019s fees as part of a civil judgment.  In its judgment, the court ordered Mangum to pay $390,000 in attorney fees, which he did not do.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the judgment imposed a civil penalty of $390.00, which was not entered until 3 October 2018.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendant consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and ordering him to repay his attorney fees in a timely fashion.  On May 2, 2020, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Conrrad of the United States District Court in Charlotte entered a judgment against Mangum that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of or purchase of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of imprisonment.   The court also granted the SEC and the District Attorney's Office an emergency asset freeze, freezing Mangum's assets, and issuing a temporary restraining order against further violations of these provisions.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 523, 566, 648 S.E.2d at 907.  Separately, the Court of Appeals issued an order appointing a receiver for Mangum in violation of Rule 9(b)(5) and ordering the receiver to send an email to the receiver informing him of the receiver's receipt of the appropriate court-ordered receiver.  Finally, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in North Carolina on May 9, 2018, charging Mangum with violating Section 15A-1444 of the Exchange Act and Rule 15a-1, and charging him with violating Rule 15b2-1 thereunder and aiding and abetting violations of Rule 15B2-2 thereunder of Exchange Act Sections 5(a) and 5(c).  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. "
