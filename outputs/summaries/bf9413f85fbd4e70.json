  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a default judgment against Maria del Carmen Onrubia de Beeck for breach of fiduciary duty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City on December 22, 2011, defendant Maria Del Carmen Onrabia De Beeck, a member of the Romero family in Peru, received millions of dollars from her husband under the guise that he was investing it for her so that she could achieve independence from her wealthy family.  The complaint alleges that over the years, defendant allegedly used the money for personal expenses, including a $430,000 profit from selling apartments in Argentina, and paid $1.958,650 in professional fees for her daughter's psychiatric services.  As alleged in the complaint, the amount of money she received from defendant was not grounded on documentary evidence from her bank accounts, but on her professional judgment.  In addition, the complaint alleges, as alleged, that defendant used her money for his own personal benefit, including paying $1,358,150 in personal expenses and $150,000 for professional fees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC complaint, Maria Onabia DeBeeck consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of $750,154 plus prejudgment interest of $7,498,562, and a civil penalty of $500,000.  Separately, the SEC announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Jose Luis Equria, an Argentinian practicing attorney, charging him with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and with aiding and abetting Maria's violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central and South American countries in this matter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
