  "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against a former sales representative for defrauding Tricare, Inc., a Florida-based health care company, and his company in connection with a fraudulent pump-and-dump scheme.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, Brady McFarland, who was employed as a Regional Marketing Representative for Florida Pharmacy Solutions, allegedly uncovered a scheme to defraud the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  The complaint alleges that the pharmacies allegedly inflated the number of doctors and nurse practitioners who submitted false claims to the government for reimbursement of medicine not manufactured by pharmaceutical companies.  As alleged in the complaint, each of the defendants allegedly provided at least one physician or nurse practitioner with a copy of a reimbursement claim that was submitted to the federal government.  In addition, the complaint allegedly alleges that each defendant signed a blanket authorization to add an ingredient or to re-fill a prescription without the patient's or the physician's consent.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint or the SEC, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
