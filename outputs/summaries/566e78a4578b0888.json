  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Georgia today entered a final judgment in favor of a Gordon County, Georgia property owner who agreed to pay $921,125 in compensation for the taking of easements and rights of way to construct power lines on his farm.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on November 17, 2016, the court granted the SEC\u2019s motion for summary judgment against James Hobgood, who was appointed as an independent appraiser by the court.  The SEC alleges that Hobgood provided expert testimony to the effect that the farm was reasonably adaptable for residential development.  Hobgood also testified that there was demand for the farm at the time of the taking, but the farm had not yet been developed.  As alleged in the complaint, Hobgood was entitled to $\u20025,500 per acre based on a pre-take value of $3,375,000, and $'2,026,350 after the taking.  In a parallel action, on May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint and a declaratory judgment against Hobgood on the same charges.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the Court granted the court summary judgment and ordered Hobgood to pay a civil penalty of $'8,435, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On May 26, 2019, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Mascianica entered final judgments against the defendants on the other side of the court, ordering Hobgood and the other appraisers to pay civil penalties of $\"8,500,\" $'1,842,250, $\"1,105,350,\" and $\"68,435,\" respectively, for a total of $1,870,000.   The court also ordered the receiver of the farm to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver, ordering the receiver to provide the copy to be sent to Hobgood.  Finally, the receiver agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay an $11,500 civil penalty.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019).  The Court also granted the receiver a temporary restraining order and ordered him to provide an accounting of the value of the property in its possession."
