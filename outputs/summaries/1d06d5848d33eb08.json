  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a defendant who has agreed to settle charges that he defrauded a city council member out of more than $1 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that former City Council member Frank Fernandez made false and misleading statements in a Facebook group that targeted a public official who had recently resigned from the city council.  According to the complaint, Fernandez falsely claimed that he was a \"convicted robber\" who had committed a \"failed robbery,\" and that he had engaged in a failed robbery.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Fernandez falsely told two of his neighbors that Fernandez was a convicted robber who had been \"found guilty\" of a felony and had been sentenced to 10 years of probation.  As alleged, Fernandez also falsely claimed in one of the posts that he engaged in an \"unlawfully successful robbery\" and that the city had obtained a court-ordered injunction to prevent him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Fernandez consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Fernandez also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and a $500,000 officer and director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5771, July 17, 2018. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
