  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin today entered a default judgment against CoVantage Credit Union, Inc., a Wisconsin-based credit card company, for defrauding a bank and credit union.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, between November 14 and November 15, 2016, Danielle Stangel made out four checks to herself, totaling $2,450, drawn on an Associated Bank account in her name.  According to the complaint, the debtor did not respond to the checks, and instead deposited the checks into her bank account and then cashed them shortly thereafter.  As alleged, the debt was so bad that the debtor could not afford to repay the debt, and the debtor never repaid the debt.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains the default judgment.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Stangel.  To determine whether to proceed with the judgment, the SEC also announced that it would seek a preliminary injunction, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the debtor, and a civil penalty of $7,500.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 24, 2017, for which the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Wisconsin Office of Financial Regulation.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 523(a)(2)(A).  The Court's order also prohibits the issuance of any civil injunctive relief, including an order appointing a receiver to determine the appropriate amount of civil penalties to be imposed upon the debtor.  On May 25, 2017 the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordered the receiver to submit an affidavit of liability for the amount of the civil penalty to be determined by the court upon motion of the court.   In its order granting the court's order, the Court also ordered that the receiver, Donna Woida, file an affidavit with the SEC stating that she had not violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the reporting provisions of Sections 523 and 523 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The court also granted the receiver's request for an officer and director bar and a penny stock bar, and ordered a hearing on May 26, 2017 to determine whether the receiver had a reasonable basis to show cause for disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon.
