  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against General Health System, Inc., a Baton Rouge, Louisiana-based health care provider, charging that it failed to provide adequate auxiliary communication aids and services to a patient who suffered a gunshot wound in April 2017.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans on January 22, 2016, Damian Francois was a \"profoundly deaf, illiterate, and language-deprived individual\" with a history of gunshot wounds and a very limited understanding of English.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of his injury, he was unable to communicate with the patient.  As alleged in the complaint, Campise and Rodriguez agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Campise.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC filed a settled administrative proceeding in which it obtained a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the receiver has consented to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a temporary officer-and-director bar from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a witness in a case involving a hearing or examination of a medical record.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-419, 2016 WL 81272 (January 22, 2018).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant search tool to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Inspector General, and the Louisiana Department of Health and Human Services in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0On May 3, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the SEC granted a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office."
