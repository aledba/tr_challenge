  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against the Fund Defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order and order freezing the assets of the fund Defendants, preventing them from obtaining a judgment against Fenner, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Indianapolis, Fenner is pursuing a claim for medical malpractice under the periodic payments plan, which requires health care providers to pay out their maximum liability. The complaint alleges that, in addition to claiming standing as a member of the general public, she is also seeking to have the fund defendants pay out a percentage of any settlement they receive from the health care provider.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Fund defendants have consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to comply with the court's order freezing assets freeze provisions of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-2 thereunder. The court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations and issued an order suspending the fund's registration with the Commission. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by David A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.
