  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against a Michigan resident who has been denied an exemption for tax year 2017.  The court entered the final judgment in favor of the individual who was denied the exemption.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Phoenix, Arizona, on December 31, 2016, a resident of Arizona purchased property in Arizona and received an exemption from the state of Arizona at closing. The court found that the property did not qualify for the exemption because it was not a principal residence, and that Arizona had automatically given the exemption to the property owner.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the individual for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the individual has consented to the entry of a final judgement that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $600,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The final judgment also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any tax-exempt property for any calendar year in which the property is subject to the exemption provided under the federal law, and requires him to provide a copy of his tax return to the tax collector at the time the exemption is issued.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-19, July 2018.  On November 2, 2019, the court entered an order granting the individual's request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 211.7cc(4) and ordering a hearing on November 5, 2019.  An SEC order appointing a receiver of the property will be instituted in the case of a default judgment that permanently restrains the jurisdiction of the court.  A hearing will be held on November 6, 2019 to determine whether to proceed with the enforcement of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206-8 thereunder, as well as the amount of any civil penalty to be determined by the court at a later date. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Court appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Arizona Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
