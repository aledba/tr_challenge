The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that the Democratic Party and Wasserman Schultz violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by improperly tipping the scales in favor of one candidate over all of the other Democratic candidates.  According to the complaint, Wasserman Schultz and her husband, Mark W.

For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2019.   The Complaint also charges the Defendants with violating Sections 206 (1) and 206 (2) and 207 (4) of Securities Act Rule 206 (4).
