  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Sioux Falls, South Dakota man for his role in an April 2017 domestic violence case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that on April 16, 2017, Scott was found guilty of two counts of aggravated assault by physical menace.  According to the complaint, Scott, who was a paramedic who had received training on trauma, suicidal behavior, and determining whether wounds were self-inflicted, used a drywall hammer to attack Tasina Swimmer, his wife of three days, and his sister, Sonia Bisonnette, to attempt to place Tasina in fear of imminent serious bodily harm.  Scott also was found not guilty of one count of aggravated battery by a police officer.  In a parallel action, the U. S.

(Advisers), and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  To determine whether Scott is entitled to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, the SEC requires that the court determine whether a defendant is medically qualified to give an opinion on the nature of a wound.  For example, Scott has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of his criminal conviction, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. Scott has also agreed to a five-year officer and director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of any company or entity that requires such a security deposit. Scott also agreed not to participate in any offering of security deposit, to be restrained by his wife, to a hearing in which he will be questioned about his own history of domestic violence, to the appointment of a trial judge, to determine whether he is qualified to provide a reasonable explanation for his actions.
