  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Lakewood Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, LLC (Lakewood) and its former resident, Helen Sauvageau, for failure to pay for her nursing home stay.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, Lakewood filed a motion to dismiss its hearing request for a mandatory discharge and opportunity to apply for Medicaid. The complaint alleges that the Department of Public Health (IDPH) had jurisdiction over the matter because it had the discretion to impose a 30-day extension on the date of the hearing. The court's order, which was entered without prejudice, permanently enjoins Lakewood from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 3 of the Nursing Home Care Act and orders it to hold a hearing on the discharge within 30 days after the final ruling.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office (AGO) today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants. The AGO's complaint charges Lakewood with violations of the federal securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and Glenn S. Gordon. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Illinois Office of the Inspector General's Division of Health and Risk Analysis. The investigation was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Regional Director of the Division of Enforcement's Public Health Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
