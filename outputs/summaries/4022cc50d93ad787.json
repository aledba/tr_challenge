  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment in contempt of court against Tenika Chambers, a Hamilton County, Ohio resident who was sentenced to 12 months in prison for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court found Chambers in contempt on two counts of contempt, one of which was for her failure to comply with a court order requiring her to turn over her cell phone.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Cincinnati, Chambers failed to comply or comply with the court order, and she was subsequently taken to the Hamilton County Justice Center to serve her three-day sentence.  In the second case, the court found that Chambers was in contempt because of her belligerence towards the bailiff in the courtroom and her \"belligeren[ce] towards court staff while demanding the return of her phone, upon her return to the courtroom, after court had ended and the judge had retired to chambers.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the first case, Chambers consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars her from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney, and imposes a ten-day consecutive term on her.  On a related matter, the Court of Common Pleas today issued a temporary restraining order against Chambers.  It also issued an order suspending her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities for a period of three years, and ordering her to surrender her phone in an effort to preserve her right to appeal the contempt finding.
