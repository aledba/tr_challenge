  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, in April and May 2009 and June 2011, defendant Ali Clay sold crack cocaine to a government informant known as \"Poochie Man.\" According to the complaint, Petitioner was told by his trial counsel that he would receive a three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility based on his prior conviction for possession of a controlled substance. However, the court found that, contrary to the representations made to the trial counsel, the amount of the defendant's prior conviction was \"unreasonable\" and could have resulted in a \"miscarriage of justice\" for the defendant. The court also ruled that, based on trial counsel's failure to inform Petitioner of this fact, he was entitled to a five-year mandatory minimum of 120 months imprisonment, which would be equal to the sentence he received as a result of his guilty plea.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Petitioner. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against the defendant, charging him with violating Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder, and seeking a temporary restraining order, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The final judgment also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock, including securities in the securities industry. In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted a parallel criminal investigation, which is ongoing. The case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Daniel A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Hershfang.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Office of Inspector General, and the Illinois State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
