  "summary": "On July 10, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Missouri entered a final judgment against the former superintendent of the Missouri State Highway Patrol of Cole County, ordering him to pay $1.2 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cole County in the District of Columbia, alleges that, on May 14, 2014, Anthony Piercy stopped Brandon Ellingson under suspicion of operating a boat while intoxicated. According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that Piercy immediately secured the life jacket and the three front clips but failed to secure the crotch strap. The complaint further alleges that after Piercy was arrested and placed under arrest, the disciplinary review board recommended that he be removed from duty and ordered to be dismissed. As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Piercy agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 536.150 of the federal securities laws, and to pay a $1,2 million civil penalty in the amount of $3,500. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Piercy. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against him, charging him with violating Section 43(150) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charging Piercy with aiding and abetting his violations of Section 42(b)(2)(A) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 43(b) and Rule 42b2-3 thereunder. The court also ordered Piercy to comply with the Commission's order to remove the life jackets from his patrol boats.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the Commission, the Secretary of State's Office and the Missouri Attorney General's Office issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether a disciplinary action should be imposed on a member of a state agency. The Commission also appointed a receiver for Piercy's release.  On July 11, 2020, the SEC filed a Complaint against the Commission for its misconduct in the Division of Alcohol & Tobacco Control, charging the superintendent with violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 43.150 and Rule 43a-4 thereunder and ordering the receiver to send a copy of the disciplinary order to the receiver. The Complaint charges the receiver with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933. The receiver has the right to determine the severity of any discipline that a superintendent may impose upon a member based on the findings of the Commission."
