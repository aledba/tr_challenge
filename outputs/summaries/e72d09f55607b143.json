  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of arson and conspiracy to commit arson.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on May 28, 2011, Carmen Febles set fire to her mother's home in Stratford, Connecticut. According to the complaint, the defendant, who spoke English and Spanish, identified herself as the homeowner's daughter and then used her cell phone to call her mother and ask her mother to identify her. The complaint further alleges that the defendant had left her car parked in the garage when she started the fire, and that she had left the car parked there when she began the fire. The SEC also alleged that, at the time of the alleged arson, the defendants had not been present at the scene of the fire when the fire began. The court also found that, contrary to the defendants' claims, the jury could not determine whether the defendant was related to the person she identified at the fire scene. In addition, the court found that there was insufficient evidence to prove that she was the victim of the arson and that the false pretrial and in-court identifications were consistent with the defendant's intent to commit the arson. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant.  In its continuing investigation, the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Leak and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Edward Leary and Lawrence Overby. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Connecticut Office of Insurance Regulation in this matter."
