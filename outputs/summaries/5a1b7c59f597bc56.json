  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against Sky Bridge Resources, LLC, a Kentucky-based information technology consulting firm, for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Louisville, Kentucky, alleges that Sky Bridge violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Sky Bridge agreed to pay $XX.00 per hour for travel time that was not included in the company\u2019s contract, and to pay a $22.00 hourly rate based on the number of hours spent traveling by car.  Sky Bridge also agreed that it would not pay a full-time employee for travel times spent on different tasks, including on-site work hours at full- and within-regular-duty-hours travel time at half-time.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In addition, the court granted Sky Bridge a temporary restraining order, which prohibits it from violating the securities laws, and ordered Sky Bridge to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit, and the case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kentucky Office of Inspector General, the United States Postal Inspection Service and the Kentucky Department of Health and Human Services.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 563, 572, (Sept. 21, 2004).  The litigation will be led by Steven Abell, Rebecca Blades, Michael Hartman, Joshua Jackson, Adam Lardner, Kishma McCray, and Christopher Pasiuk. The case has been supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit."
