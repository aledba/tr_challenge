  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Kentucky today announced criminal charges against a Kentucky-based company and its former president for defrauding an employee out of $8,788.62.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Louisville, Kentucky, alleges that Kentucky Secretary of State John Heffernan violated the federal securities laws by failing to pay a civil penalty to a former employee of Babcock Power International, Inc. for unpaid vacation time.  According to the complaint, Kapsalis filed a complaint with the Secretary of Labor on April 12, 2013 alleging that the company had violated the anti-fraud provisions of KRS 337.055 and failed to pay him the total amount of vacation time he was entitled to.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in a parallel action, the Kentucky Attorney General's Office issued a final order on April 13, 2016, ordering the company to pay an additional $250,000 in civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the company consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins the company from violating the charged provisions, and orders it to pay the civil penalty of $250. The company agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of compensation paid to the employee. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2020, the SEC filed a civil action against Vogt, alleging that he violated the antifraud provision of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is continuing its investigation, which is continuing to be conducted by the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, with the assistance of the Kentucky Department of Labor's Office of Inspector General. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Kentucky Office of Insurance Regulation."
