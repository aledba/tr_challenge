  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a New Jersey-based psychiatrist and her treating physician in connection with her alleged inability to perform work-related mental health services.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, from 2013 through 2016, the Alabama Department of Health and Human Services (ALDHS) failed to consider the medical evidence presented in evaluating and weighing Guice\u2019s mental health claims. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Dr. Perdue and Veronique Sebastian told Guice that she was severely impaired by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), grade I diastolic dysfunction, sleep apnea, anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and agoraphobia. The complaint further alleges that Guice was unable to perform various semi-skilled, sedentary jobs, including clerical sorter, records clerk, and data-entry clerk.  According to the complaint, the ALJ did not consider any of these medical evidence and instead relied on the opinion of one of the state-agency psychologists, who provided their opinion in 2013 based on a review of Guice's then-existing medical records.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Guice consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney\u2019S Office for New York announced criminal proceedings against Guice.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Welshhans granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Guice to comply with the court order. The SEC previously issued an order suspending Guice from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a witness in a case that was investigated by the agency. In its order, the SEC also instituted an asset freeze and other emergency relief, including an officer-and-director bar, and an officer and director bar.  Guice agreed to settle the SEC action by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a five-year conduct-based injunction. The settlement is subject to court approval. The court also agreed to the appointment of a receiver to determine whether to issue an order appointing a receiver for Guice based on the evidence in the record. The receiver will determine the receiver's age, education, and willingness to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation."
