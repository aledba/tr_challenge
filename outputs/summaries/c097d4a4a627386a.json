  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of South Carolina today announced criminal charges against a former prisoner for filing a third qualifying complaint in federal court.  According to the SEC's complaint, Therl Taylor, an indigent state prisoner, filed three pro se civil rights actions in the United States in 2015, 2016, and 2017, alleging that seven employees of the South Carolina Department of Corrections and the City of Allendale had denied him access to the prison\u2019s mailroom services, interfering with his ability to petition the courts.  The complaint also alleged that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1915(g) of the federal securities laws, including the right to a third strike.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants also violated the pre-judgment provisions of \u00a715(g).  The SEC alleges that, in violation of these provisions, Taylor was not able to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal from the date of his third qualifying dismissal.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Taylor has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, and orders him to pay an initial partial filing fee based on the funds available in the prisoner's account, not just the third strike of the same action.  In addition, the court granted Taylor a temporary restraining order, freezing his assets, and barring him from participating in any future securities law enforcement actions.  Finally, the complaint alleges that Taylor violated Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.    In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Office of Inspector General have issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the potential for fraud in the prison system.  Investors should be aware that the SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 Investors can also check the background by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's investor.gov website to quickly spot signs of fraud and to identify people who are at risk of losing their investment."
