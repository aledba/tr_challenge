  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Yapi Bonifon, a C\u00f4te D'Ivoire resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, in 1998, when he was 23 years old, Yapi entered the United States on a long-haul container ship bound for Abidjan, Ivory Coast. According to the complaint, he was told that he was inadmissible as a stowaway because he did not have permission to be on the ship and thus was not entitled to permanent resident status. The complaint further alleges that he took a broom from an area where several brooms were located and swept the floor of the ship alongside the ship's crew members. He allegedly used the broom to conceal his presence from the crew, who were verbally abusive and intimidating him. Finally, the complaint alleges that during his second interview, ISO Dorfman was abusive to him by yelling, badgering, and threatening him. The SEC alleges that the officers took advantage of his diminished physical and mental state to coerce him into making a statement concerning facts he could not remember. The court's order, which was entered in a parallel administrative proceeding, prohibits Bonif\u00f3n from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related matter, the SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David A. Kasper and Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jeh Johnson, Denis Riordan, and Leon Rodriguez. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. The\u00c2\u00a0SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
