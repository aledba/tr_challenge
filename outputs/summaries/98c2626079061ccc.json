  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 31, 2016 entered a final judgment against defendant Walter Guity, who was charged with two felony counts of third-degree sexual assault in the family court case.  The court found that Guity was entitled to withdraw his guilty pleas pursuant to a global plea agreement.  According to the court's order, on May 18, 2011, Guity entered a plea agreement in which he agreed to be barred from representing himself on a plea to a crime he could not commit under the federal securities laws.  Guity also agreed to a five-year prison term and to a six-year officer-and-director bar.  On January 17, 2012, the court granted Guity's request to represent himself in a parallel criminal case, in which Guity pleaded guilty to the same felony and was sentenced to twelve months of community placement.  At the end of the hearing, the judge ruled that the plea agreement violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Guity.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the New York Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
