  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with resisting an officer in the performance of duty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that A.L. was in a fight with her sister when officers responded to the scene. The complaint alleges that, as a result of her actions, A.l. was unable to resist the officers, who were then placed in handcuffs.  According to the complaint, the court found that the defendants had no right to detain her, because, as the victim of her sister's attack, they were not performing their duty when they resisted.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced that it would seek a court-ordered injunction and an officer-on-officer injunction.  On August 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of California entered a judgment against A. L. Gibson, finding that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 and $20,000, respectively, for each of the charged violations. The court also granted the defendants the right to return to parental custody under supervision of a probation officer, and ordered the officers to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for September 5, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 24, 2018).  The case was supervised by Amy C. Welshhans, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations, and a member of the Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, and the New Jersey State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
