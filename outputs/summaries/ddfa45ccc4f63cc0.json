  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama today entered a final judgment against Black Diamond Management, LLC, Black Diamond's parent company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that defendants misappropriated, misused, or overstated the value of the coal, timber, and timber resources that belonged to Black Diamond.  According to the complaint, the defendants took and sold Plaintiff\u2019s timber without authority to do so and did not acquire ownership of the resources.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Black Diamond sent two letters to Twin Pines claiming ownership over the resources taken by the defendants, but that the defendants continued to collect and sell the resources as if they were owned by them.  Black Diamond also allegedly met with Drummond and sent two \"blasting\" notices\" concerning the mining operations where it \"was pointed out by Drummond that mining had already taken place with respect to the natural resources that Plaintiff claims ownership over.\"  The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the SEC charged Black Diamond with violating the Lanham Act and Exchange Act, and the federal district court agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint.   The court also granted the SEC the right to a temporary restraining order, which prohibits defendants from violating the federal securities laws, and ordered Black Diamond to pay a civil penalty of $5,000. \u00c2\u00a0Black Diamond agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $6,500, which is equal to the civil penalties.  On August 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of Georgia entered a judgment ordering the SEC to seek a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal anti-racketeering laws, as well as an order appointing a receiver to oversee the purchase and sale of any unregistered or unregistered mineral, coal, or timber resources in the United States. The SEC previously issued an order requiring defendants to show cause of action in connection with the purchase or sale of a certain amount of the unregistered and unregistered resources in a certain state.  This order requires defendants to demonstrate that they had reasonable expectation that their claims would be supported by the facts presented in the complaint.  For example, the court found that: (1) Black Diamond falsely represented that it owned the coal and timber reserves; (2) it had adopted a mark or name that was the same, or confusingly similar to its mark, such that consumers were likely to confuse the two; and (3)"
