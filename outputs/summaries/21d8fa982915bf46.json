  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dayton, Ohio, alleges that James M. Jackson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the court improperly admitted Dr. Smith's report into evidence and permitted it to go directly to the jury during their deliberations.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, after the trial concluded, the trial judge improperly admitted to the report that Ms. Marquez's pain was due to an ailment unrelated to the automobile accident.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it granted a new trial pursuant to Civ.R. 59(A)(1) and (4) and that the jury found that the defendant was prevented from having a fair trial based on the improperly admitted report.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint or the jury's findings, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of $67,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $500,000.  Jackson also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock.  On November 3, 2004, the Ohio Court of Common Pleas granted Jackson's motion for a temporary restraining order against further violations of the securities laws, ordered him to comply with the court's order, and issued a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of these provisions, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interests, and to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the parties.   The court also granted Jackson the right to reapply as a trial judge in the future without prejudice to the parties involved in the case.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2008-Ohio-1912."
