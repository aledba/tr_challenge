  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Bassett, finding that he failed to allege a serious injury in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Bassett to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Bassett with violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Bassett consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to pay $100 to $1,000 in civil penalties, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Bassett also agreed to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the United States.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Financial Regulation today announced criminal charges against Bassett arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  On June 3, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a temporary restraining order, and a permanent injunction against future violations.  Last week, the Court granted the SEC request for an emergency asset freeze and other emergency relief, including an asset freeze, and issued an order temporarily restraining Bassett from further violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and ordering him to surrender his passport and other personal information in order to be able to apply for the asset freeze. The court also granted the court's request for a temporary injunction, which is pending final approval by the SEC. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Office of the Secretary of State's Office."
