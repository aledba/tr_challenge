  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Time Warner Cable, Inc., a cable operator based in San Diego, California, that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 17a-5(b) and (c) thereunder.  The court also ordered Time Warner to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Time Warner and its franchising authorities failed to adequately assess the value of the possessory interests in providing cable television, broadband, and telephone services.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the County of San Diego and the Assessor erred in valuing the interests based solely on the valuation of the franchise interests.  Time Warner has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and requiring the County to determine the fair market value of its acquireory interests by capitalizing the franchise fee.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the County consented to a permanent injunction, which prohibits the County from imposing any such monetary penalty, and the District Attorney's Office from issuing an officer-and-director bar.  It also agreed to pay $1,500 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of its civil penalties.  Finally, the court granted the County's request for a temporary restraining order, which is subject to court approval, and ordered it to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in a parallel action.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the San Diego Regional Office and supervised by Eric Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Karpel.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, the Los Angeles Police Department, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
