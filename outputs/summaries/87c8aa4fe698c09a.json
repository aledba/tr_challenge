  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of John D. Chesteen, Jr., a California resident, who is seeking priority treatment in bankruptcy against the Federal Bureau of Investigation for his alleged role in a fraudulent scheme to evade the agency's reporting requirements.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, prior to the implementation of the federal tax law in 2016, Chesteen was required to make a $695 SRP for tax year 2016 but failed to do so.  According to the complaint, the SRP is a penalty, not a tax, that is required to be paid by the person or entity paying it.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Chesteen failed to make the required $1,000 SRP because he failed to timely submit a repayment plan.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Chesteen to pay a civil penalty of $695, which is equal to the amount of his pre-tax income.  Chesteen also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and ordered to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer and director bar.  On January 2, 2020, the SEC filed an emergency action in which it obtained a temporary restraining order against Chesteen and other defendants, and obtained an emergency court order freezing Chesteen\u2019s assets and ordering him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $20,000, respectively.  Finally, the court issued an order suspending Chesteen from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney in a case brought by the SEC in which he was a defendant.
