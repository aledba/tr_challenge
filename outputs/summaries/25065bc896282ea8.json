  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant's motion to dismiss from the securities fraud case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that, on March 7, 2012, defendant, Peter Ortega, was indicted on twenty identical counts of possession of child pornography.  According to the complaint, the defendants initially faced a series of false and misleading statements about the nature and severity of the alleged delay.  In one instance, the complaint alleges that defendant personally requested additional time to consider the plea offer and postpone the filing of a superseding indictment and subsequent trial on the same charges.  As alleged, the defendant's request was met with skepticism from his family, who did not believe that the defendant was entitled to a speedy trial and instead relied on his lengthy period of incarceration.

Additionally, the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order, which prohibits defendants from making material misrepresentations to the SEC, and ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of the background of the defendant and determine whether there is sufficient evidence to determine whether the defendant is a sufficient defendant to proceed with a trial. The SEC also instituted an asset freeze, which is intended to prevent future violations of the securities laws.  Finally, the SEC instituted an expedited hearing for the defendant on January 30, 2013, at which a hearing was scheduled for August 4, 2014. The hearing followed by a hearing scheduled for September 8, 2014 that was delayed by approximately one month.  A hearing on February 13, 2015, was not conducted until after the hearing. The court denied the request for an emergency hearing and scheduled a hearing for March 29, 2014 to consider whether the case was ready to go forward with a superseded indictment and trial on September 8. The case was later rescheduled for August 9, 2014 for a hearing that"
