  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of North Dakota today entered a final judgment against Dallas Wayne Thundershield, Jr., a convicted felon, on three counts of second-degree murder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fort Totten, North Dakota, on April 9, 2016, Thundershirtield and his uncle, Richard Dean Demarce Sr., were driving to a convenience store when they were confronted by two men in a red pickup truck who allegedly had been drinking heavily. According to court documents, the two men were inconsistent and untrustworthy witnesses whom no reasonable juror could have believed. The SEC alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, the truck driver and passenger in the truck repeatedly told the truck's owner that he had to kill them and that he was going to take the truck. The complaint further alleges that the truck stopped at the convenience store where the men were buying groceries and liquor. The truck driver allegedly told the men to \"shut the f**k up\" and \"[g]o go to bed or go to your room.\" The complaint also alleges that when confronted by an EMT who described the truck as having a \"fairly large blade\" on the back of the driver's seat and a key fob that fit the ignition of the truck, he allegedly took it out of his pants pocket and held it there until the officer and the EMT could determine whether he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Chicago Regional Office. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Mr. Kerndetter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York, and the Fort Worth Field Office of the Department of Justice."
