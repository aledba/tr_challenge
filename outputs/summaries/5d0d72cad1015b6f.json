  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Tennessee father who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 36-1-124(d) of the federal parental rights laws.  The court also entered an order suspending the father from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 1, 2016, the father filed a notice of appeal in a termination of parental rights proceeding against his then-wife, Melissa R. (\u201cMother\u201d), and her husband, Aurelio G. (\"Stepfather\u201d).  The complaint alleges that the father failed to timely respond to the court\u2019s order suspending his parental rights.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court also ordered the father to show cause why he should not be appointed counsel for the termination proceeding and to cooperate with counsel throughout the appeal.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee today announced criminal charges against the father.  On August 24, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Father, charging him with violations of the registration provisions of section 36-2-124 of the state parental rights law. The SEC also charged the father with violating Section 10(b) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charged him with aiding and abetting the father's violations of Section 9(a) of Exchange Act Rules 10b2-1 and Rule 9a-3 thereunder.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Scott Frost and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Frost and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Hershfang, Chief of the Division of Enforcement, and the case has been supervised by Joseph G. Sansone. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Tennessee Attorney General's Office, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Tennessee Department of Health and Human Services."
