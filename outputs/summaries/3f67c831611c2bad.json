  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two Cleveland men for their roles in a series of bank robberies.  According to the SEC's complaint, on May 14, 2016, Almetrice Scriven, an assistant manager at the Dollar Tree on East 116th Street in Cleveland, Ohio, and Demon Carter, a Dollar Tree employee, helped Holmes plan the robberies. The complaint alleges that, on the day of the robberies, the two men allegedly ran up to the front of the store and demanded that the cashier close the shutters.  As alleged in the complaint, the three men then allegedly chased each other around the store.  The complaint further alleges that during the closing process, the men ran up, grabbed the cash register, and confronted the two cashiers, who then fled the scene in their vehicles.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the men, charging them with the same felony, and imposing a mandatory minimum seven-year prison term.   The SEC's Complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Holmes with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Holmes consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his sentence.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.  On August 15, 2018, a jury found Holmes guilty of one count of Hobbs Act robbery and sentenced him to five years in prison.  At the time of his sentencing, the jury deliberated for two hours before finding him guilty of the other charges.  To determine whether Holmes was entitled to resentencing, the court had to determine whether he was a reasonable person to believe that he had acted in accordance with the charged laws.  It also ordered him to sign a civil injunctive relief order, which requires him to show that he has complied with the court's orders, and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty to be determined by the court upon motion of the court.  Finally, the SEC charged Holmes with aiding and abetting the three Dollar Tree robberies"
