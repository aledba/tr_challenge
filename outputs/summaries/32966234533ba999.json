  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the District of Columbia against Snodgrass-King Pediatric Dental Assocs., P.C.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, alleges that, in 2013, DentaQuest USA Insurance Company, Inc. (DentaQuest), a Tennessee-based dental-benefits manager, and its former CEO, Barry Major, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On May 15, 2013, a federal district court in Nashville, Tenn., granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to comply with the court's order.   The court also granted the defendants the right to return their allegedly forged documents to the SEC, which were unsealed on May 24, 2013.  As alleged in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the court found that the defendants violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment by failing to provide sufficient evidence to support state action under the Exchange Act.  Without admitting, however, the Defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal and state securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly unlawful gains, and ordering the Defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 each.  Additionally, the Court granted the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment against the Defendants, which is subject to court approval.  Finally, the SEC filed an emergency action against the defendants, charging them with violations of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and with aiding and abetting the defendants\u2019 violations of Rule 13a-14, and seeking injunctions against future violations.
