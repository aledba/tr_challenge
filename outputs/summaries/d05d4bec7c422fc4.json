  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against a former director of SOS Ministries of Muhlenberg County, Ky., finding him guilty of six counts of sodomy and four counts of first-degree sexual abuse.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky, alleges that, in 2015, Jesse Leroy Graham, the former director, took underprivileged children on fishing trips.  According to the complaint, Appellant was involved with young boys and would take them on trips to the beach.  As alleged, one of the children, Lonnie, told his then-wife that he had taken the boys on the trips because he was upset that they would not get to see Marcus anymore.  He also allegedly told his mother that he drank a bottle of whiskey, passed out with a firearm, and was later discovered with a gunshot wound to the leg.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed criminal charges against Graham, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the books and records and records provisions of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) and the reporting provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone, Judge of the Eastern District, entered a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, with prejudgment interests to be determined by the court at a later date.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 579 (Ky. 1999).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Kentucky Division of Criminal Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Kentucky Office of Inspector General, the Criminal Investigations, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Kentucky Department of Banking and Securities and Exchange Commission."
