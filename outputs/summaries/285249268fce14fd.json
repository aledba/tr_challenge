  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. (State Farm) in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minneapolis, alleges that, following a motor vehicle accident, Jennifer Rodriguez sought and received chiropractic care from a chiropractor, Core Health Chiropractic, under the workers' compensation regime. According to the complaint, Rodriguez, who was injured in the accident while working, sought the care from Core Health, but was barred from seeking reimbursement because of Old Republic's determination that more than 12 weeks of care was excessive, unnecessary, or inappropriate. The complaint further alleges that Rodriguez never sought reimbursement or payment for the additional chiropractor services provided by Core Health. The SEC alleges that the complaint was filed under the guise of a no-fault policy, and that Rodriguez sought reimbursement only for the services of her second chiropractor. The Complaint alleges that State Farm denied Rodriguez's request for reimbursement because it did not deem the chiropractor to be excessive or unnecessary, and because Rodriguez had not sought compensation for her other chiropractor's services. The court also ruled that Rodriguez could not pay for additional care from her own pocket because of the limitation it chose. The Court of Appeals also found that, under those circumstances, Rodriguez was not barred by the workers\u2019 compensation law from seeking compensation from any source, including \"any source\" including \u201canother insurer.\u201d The court ruled in favor of Rodriguez and ordered her to pay $16,883, which was the full amount that she had sought plus interest and costs. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Rodriguez. The case is being handled by Scott Frost, Eric Werner, and Amy Gwiazda of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Frost and Ms. Werner."
