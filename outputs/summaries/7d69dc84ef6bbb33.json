  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against BPL Exploration, Ltd., a Texas-based oil and gas company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Antonio, Texas, alleges that, in April of 2000, BPL and Cody offered to buy the JOA properties from BPL for $777,000, and that the price allocated by BPL was $947,000.  According to the complaint, however, when BPL submitted its bill of review, it did not include the full record of the transaction.  Instead, the complaint alleges that it relied on testimony from a BPL manager, Bill Baker, who initially testified he did not believe the price represented to him, but later decided to waive that statement when he had come to believe it was true.  BPL's motion for summary judgment was denied on the basis of its own misconduct.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Cody.  On November 15, 2017, the trial court issued a judgment that permanently enjoins BPL from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million and $2 million, respectively, in the amount of disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $2.2 million.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws, ordering BPL to submit a partial record to the court as a matter of law, and ordering the court to determine whether to issue a judgment in its favor based on the facts presented at the trial.  Additionally, the court granted BPL a temporary restraining order and ordered the company to pay a civil penalty of $10,000 and a $500,000 civil penalty.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about summary judgments, see Litigation Release No. 522, 543 (Tex. App.\u2014San Antonio 2016).  In addition, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
