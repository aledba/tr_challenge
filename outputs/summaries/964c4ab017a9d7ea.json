  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against a Wallace, N.C., woman charged with identity theft in July 2017.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that, on 29 August 2015, Kathryn L. Griffin called Aaron's Rental to report suspected identity theft. According to the complaint, Griffin and her ex-boyfriend, Janice K. Mooney, used the credit card information of Griffin and Mooney to make purchases at Aaron\u2019s Rental. The complaint also alleges that Griffin used the names of two other credit card holders to make two purchases at First Class Tanning in Wallace. The SEC alleges that the defendants used the victims\u2019 credit card numbers to make the purchases, which were completed by themselves, and that the sales manager recognized the victims and signed their names on the receipts.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against Griffin.  On May 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of South Carolina entered final judgment against Griffin, Mooney and Griffin. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants, and a conduct-based injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and pay civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 15A-1443 of the Exchange Act, and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 52497 (2014).  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, an officer and director bar, and the return of any officer or director of a public company with the right to reapply as a defendant upon motion by the court upon motion of the court.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by James P. Scercy and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter."
