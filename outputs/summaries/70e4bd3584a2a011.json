  "summary": "On March 17, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against defendant Thomas T. Flynn, finding him liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, in 2015, Flynn was stopped by a Cadillac driving in front of him in the left lane. According to the complaint, Flynn asked the court to grant him a temporary restraining order preventing him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws. The court granted the request, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, and ordered Flynn to pay a civil penalty of $160,000. The complaint also alleges that Flynn failed to disclose to the jury that he had researched the Cadillac's registration and a license plate number, and that he did not know what was in the Cadillac or the driver of the Cadillac. In addition, the complaint alleges that he failed to report his observations as to the Cadillac at Flynn's house and the results of his search of the DMV records. The SEC further alleges that the jury never heard about the suppressed evidence, and the defendant did not respond to the SEC\u2019s request for a retainer.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for New York today announced criminal charges against Flynn.  On March 18, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Flynn, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case was supervised by Assistant Chief of the New York Division of Criminal Investigation. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
