  "summary": "On June 29, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee entered a final judgment against General Motors Co.'s (GM) former CEO, Titus Gulley, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Maury County, Tennessee, alleges that, on July 12, 2017, Gulley drove to work and parked in an employee parking lot provided by GM. At the time he had a handgun in his vehicle, secreted in a small compartment below the steering wheel.  According to the complaint, after learning that GM was not going to fire him unless and until he successfully completed the second fit-for-duty evaluation, he was told that he would be placed on leave rather than returned to work.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, this was not preempted by the company's policy.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the company violated its duty of fair representation by not requiring Gulley to submit to any further medical or psychological evaluations predicated upon the July 2017 incident or any subsequent possession of a handgun inside his vehicle.

On August 24, 2018, the court granted a motion for summary judgment against GM and ordered it to comply with the court's order.  At the same time, on September 2, 2018 the SEC filed a complaint against GM alleging that Gulley had violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by failing to disclose that he had taken a gun out of his vehicle and had concealed it in a separate compartment in his locked vehicle. The complaint also alleges that GM violated Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and that the complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, including the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter, and an officer-director bar.  Finally, the Court granted a request for a conduct-based injunction against"
