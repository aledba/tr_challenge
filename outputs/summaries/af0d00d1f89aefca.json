  "summary": "On May 3, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment in favor of a motion to compel arbitration against Jetro Cash and Carry Enterprises, Inc., and Restaurant Depot, LLC (collectively \"Defendants\") in an employment discrimination action brought by Nadine Clymer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that Defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Defendants failed to disclose to the court that they had waived the one-year temporal limitation provision of the arbitration agreement, which required arbitration to be submitted within one year of the event giving rise to the employment discrimination claims.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to inform the court of their obligations under the agreement, and that the arbitration costs provision is unenforceable because it requires the arbitration party to pay a reasonable amount of the fees and expenses associated with the arbitration.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendants have consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay $1,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the judgment orders Defendants to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 penalty.  On May 4, the court issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants' assets, and ordering the issuance of an order appointing an independent arbitrator to evaluate the merits of the case.   The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from participating in administrative proceedings, including with respect to the appointment of an arbitrator, and requiring the parties to submit written arbitration agreements. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott Specialty Gases of the Philadelphia Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Gase and Ms. Caldwell. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Office of Financial Regulation, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Pennsylvania Office of the Attorney General."
