  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a Florida man who was charged with obstruction of a federal officer's investigation of a New Year's Eve party.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that Devin Bass got drunk and angry and hit Cody Healy in the face so hard that Healy fell back into a bonfire. According to the complaint, Bass told the officer that he was going to arrest Healy and detain him until he was satisfied by the evidence presented to the court. The complaint further alleges that Bass lied to the officer about the nature of the alleged obstruction and that he did not commit the crime. Bass also alleges that the officer did not respond to Bass's allegations that he had committed the obstruction. The court ultimately found that Bass was not guilty of the obstruction charge, and that Bass should have been sentenced to five years' imprisonment and one year of supervised release.  Bass's complaint charges Bass with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Bass. The SEC also seeks a temporary restraining order, a civil injunctive relief order, and a bar prohibiting Bass from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a law enforcement agency.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Bass has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of five years, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate case, the SEC charged Bass with a felony battery with great bodily harm, and charged him with resisting an officer without reasonable doubt. The jury found Bass guilty on all counts, and Bass was sentenced to a five-year prison term and ordered to return to the trial court for a hearing on the same matter.  On the same day, Bass pleaded guilty to one count of obstructing an officer in connection with a related criminal case. The judgment also ordered Bass to pay $1,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and ordered him to be barred from the securities industry.  To settle the SEC case, Bass agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and to be restrained from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney."
