  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against defendant Lamont Roberts, who was found guilty of five counts of unlawful disclosure of a sexual image to a third party.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the Southern District of New York, from October 2013 through October 2015, Mr. Roberts began telling L.H. that he was going to show her a photo of himself with a baseball bat and tell her that he would \"make her a living hell\" if she took the photo.  The complaint further alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, the defendant showed up at her home one morning and told her to get out of the car.  As alleged, the next morning, as she was leaving her house, the two of them began to argue through their car windows that the image had to be viewed by someone other than the person depicted in the image.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On October 9, 2015, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Roberts, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 17(b)(2) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.N. Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
