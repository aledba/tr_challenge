  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Alaska today announced criminal charges against Sofia Morales de Lopez, a California resident who was injured while working as a fish sorter at a Dutch Harbor processing plant.  According to the SEC's complaint, Morales sought a court order requiring Unisea to pay a $5,000 penalty for late payment of her job dislocation benefit.  The complaint alleges that Morales was injured in a fall while working and was unable to return to her prior job.  As alleged in the complaint, the company was required to pay PPI compensation within 21 days of receiving a 5% whole person impairment rating for Morales\u2019s lumbar spine.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, unisea agreed that it had to pay the compensation when it received the 5% impairment rating, and that it should have paid the additional $8,000 after the first impairment rating.  In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has issued an order suspending or ordering the suspension of certain of Morales&rdqua;s benefits pending final approval by the court.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Morales, charging her with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Morales.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and is being supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Department of Justice and the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Alaska Department of Insurance, and the Alaska Office of Financial Regulation."
