  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Bill Cosby, who has agreed to settle charges that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on November 18, 2014, Cosby, a successful model and television personality, told a nationally televised interview that he had drugged and raped a woman in 1982.  According to the complaint, the allegations in the press releases were false and misleading.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Cosby, through an attorney, signed and disseminated two press releases that contained false claims about the alleged victim.  As alleged, the defendants' statements were not true, and they were not corroborated by any corroborating evidence.  Instead, the SEC alleges that the defendants made numerous misrepresentations to the public in the days leading up to the November 20 and 21 press releases, and that they did not represent a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits of the claims in the complaint.  For example, as alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Dickinson was one of the earlier victims of Cosby's alleged misconduct, and she was the first victim of his alleged misconduct to publicly allege that she had been sexually assaulted.  Dickinson's attorney, Martin Singer, agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and requires him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Dickinson consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the charged provisions, ordering her to comply with the court's order, imposing a $25,000 civil penalty, and requiring her to pay a $10,000 penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On November 19, 2014 the court granted a request for a temporary restraining order against Cosby and ordered him to return his allegedly defamatory statements to the court.  A hearing on November 20, 2014 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  To determine whether to proceed with the litigation, the court ordered that the SEC consider whether to issue an order imposing a preliminary injunction, imposing an officer-and-director bar, and imposing a conduct-based injunction.  It also ordered the SEC to conduct an independent investigation into the alleged conduct of the alleged victims of the Cosby rapes, which it has not done, and to conduct a background check on the alleged perpetrators of the rapes. The SEC is continuing its litigation against Cosby."
