  "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against The Robare Group, a Houston, Texas-based investment adviser, and its principals for failing to adequately disclose conflicts of interest arising from a payment arrangement with Fidelity Investments.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, from at least 2004 through at least April 2014, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  According to the complaint, in 2004, Mark Robare, Carol Hearn & Jack Jones, when acting as investment advisers to approximately 350 separately managed discretionary accounts and had approximately $150 million in assets under management, received payments from Fidelity for maintaining client investments in certain funds Fidelity offered.  In addition, the complaint alleges that between September 2005 and September 2013, Robare and TRG received approximately four hundred thousand dollars, which was approximately 2.5% of TRG\u2019s gross revenue.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Additionally, TRG and the principals agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 207, and ordered to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $100,000, respectively, for each of those violations.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Daniel Kornman."
