  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against a former supervisor of the Automated Traffic Enforcement Unit (ATU) who was barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency because of his race.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Columbia, Missouri, Mark E. Robinson, a former ATU supervisor, filed a civil injunctive action on June 8, 2018, alleging that he was unlawfully barred from working in the ATU because he failed to demonstrate that he had sufficient experience to perform the duties required to perform those duties.  The court also found that Mr. Robinson was entitled to a reasonable hourly rate based on his experience, but did not receive a reasonable rate of back pay.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Robinson.   The SEC's complaint charges Robinson with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Robinson consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $750,000, which is equal to the amount of his attorney's fees and back pay he seeks.  On June 9, 2019, the court granted the District's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered Robinson to comply with the court order, and ordered him to provide a copy of the Final Judgment, which was entered by the court on June 13, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 24, 2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Office of Inspector General, under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri Department of Insurance, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
