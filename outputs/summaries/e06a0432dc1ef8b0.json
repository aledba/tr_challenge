  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against Ford Motor Company (Ford) in a civil injunctive action brought by Scott and his wife.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Michigan, Scott was exposed to asbestos while servicing brakes and clutches supplied by a wide variety of manufacturers and merchants, including Ford.  The complaint alleges that, while working as a mechanic, Scott developed mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lung particularly associated with asbestos exposure.  As alleged in the complaint, Scott's injuries were so severe that he was able to note, on at least three occasions, that none of the injured workers had worked with brake or clutch assembly or service stations.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Scott had been exposed to a \"sophisticated user\" defense, using the sophisticated user doctrine, which requires a defendant to show that he or she is aware of or should have been aware of the risks associated with exposure to asbestos in a product.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's judgment, Ford consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  Ford also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Insurance, and the Michigan Office of Insurance Regulation."
