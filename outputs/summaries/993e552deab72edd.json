  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Gaston County, North Carolina, alleges that, in finding Patterson liable for felony possession of drugs on jail premises, the court improperly revoked his supervised release.  According to the complaint, Patterson told the court that he was addicted to drugs and had a history of drug possession, and that he hoped to avoid a prison sentence by disposing of the drugs in the common area.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court failed to mention the fact that Patterson had used Xanax and heroin before he overdosed on a combination of the illegal drugs.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Patterson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The judgment also imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar against Patterson, and bars him from serving any prison term for five years and a three-year period. The court's order also prohibits Patterson from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any drug, including Xanax, heroin, or any other controlled substance, and requires him to provide a written explanation for why he has not done so.  On the other hand, the order imposes a six-month officer- and director-bar against Patterson.  For further information, see United States v. Wright, 562 F.3d 572, 355 (4th Cir. 1992).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for North Carolina announced criminal charges against Patterson arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 24, 2018.  To learn more about supervised release, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 596.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John R. Sansone and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Mr. Werner. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Court appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the U."
