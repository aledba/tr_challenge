  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against Mississippi resident Shaula Lanear Allen in a civil injunctive action brought by her son, J.L. Allen.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Allen violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Allen, as a representative payee and as a member of a committee that administers SSI benefits, improperly relied on the SEC's presumption that the funds in her conservatorship account were available for the maintenance and support of a minor child.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the SEC failed to consider the fact that the account was a resource and that Allen did not have access to the funds for the child's support and maintenance.  Allen's complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the SEC issued an order requiring Allen to withdraw $13,062.73 from the account, which he did not do because of the nature of the overpayment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Allen agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $20,000, and orders Allen to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,038, and to pay civil penalties of $15,105. The SEC also ordered Allen to comply with an order appointing a receiver for the minor child's education.  On May 24, 2018, the court granted Allen's request for a hearing before an administrative law judge and ordered him to deposit the settlement proceeds into a trust account with a federally insured institution where he will receive the funds as part of his education. The court also granted Allen a temporary restraining order, which prohibits Allen from using the funds to pay for his education or to purchase a computer, and requires Allen to provide for the education of his son.  As alleged in the complaint filed in the SEC, Allen was not entitled to the right to access the account for the purpose of providing for his or her son's education, and was not permitted to withdraw the funds from the trust account until he reached the age of twenty-one years of age.  Instead, Allen allegedly used the money to purchase computer equipment and to support his son's medical expenses.  Finally, Allen's attorney, John R. McCluskey, filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Jackson against the SEC for the Southern District of New York, charging Allen with violations of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10"
