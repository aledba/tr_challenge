  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a Calumet City, Illinois man who was convicted of attempted first-degree murder and home invasion in 2007.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on October 21, 2007, defendant Eddie Douglas was arrested and charged with attempted first degree murder, home invasion, aggravated domestic battery, and aggravated battery. The complaint alleges that Douglas was the only person in the house at the time of the alleged attack, and that he was not the only one who had a knife. The SEC alleges that the Baymont Inn surveillance video, which was recovered from the victim's home, showed that defendant left work at 4:30 a.m. and returned home at 5:05 a. m. He was later found guilty of the same charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison. According to the complaint, Douglas also was denied a fair trial where the prosecutor called him \"garbage\" in rebuttal closing arguments, and the jury found him guilty of one count of felony theft.  In a parallel criminal case, Douglas was convicted on two counts of aiding and abetting another defendant's theft and attempted second-degree theft. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Douglas and ordered him to return to the district court for a hearing on the matter.  On September 17, 2012, the court granted a motion for summary judgment against Douglas, ordering him to be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Douglas to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against him.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Adams consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. Adams agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction. Adams also agreed to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged theft of a Baymont inn surveillance videotape. Adams has agreed to the appointment of a receiver to record the theft of the videotape in his possession. The receiver will receive a copy of the stolen videotape and will determine whether to send it to the receiver. The jury will determine the amount of restitution owed by Adams and Adams in the future."
