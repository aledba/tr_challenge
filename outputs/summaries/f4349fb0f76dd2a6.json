  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Rodney McDonald Williams, Jr., a convicted felon who was found competent to stand trial on two counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, Williams told a trial court that he had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic with substance abuse issues, and that he was going to be receiving his money from his tort claim any day.  The complaint alleges that Williams told the court that his current criminal charges were related to a tort claim against the State.  He also allegedly claimed his deceased father had connections to rap artists and producers.  Williams also allegedly told a friend that his father was a \"witch\" who had a \"hidden agenda.\"  The SEC alleges that, according to the complaint, Williams and his attorney, Charles Vance, M.D., were aware of his client\u2019s deteriorating mental health and were unable to assist him in preparing and implementing a defense.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, Defendant had a history of not taking his medication as prescribed, and was a frequent drinker.  In addition, the complaint alleges, Williams had been convicted of a prior felony and sentenced to a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Williams consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a $1,000,000 officer-and-director bar.  Additionally, Williams agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be restrained and restrained from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a result of his prior criminal convictions.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the Court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Williams to return to the United States to comply with the court order.   The court also granted the request for an emergency court order requiring Williams to provide a copy of the final judgment to a jury that would determine whether or not to hold a competency hearing for Williams and to issue an order appointing a receiver to represent the defendant in a jury trial.
