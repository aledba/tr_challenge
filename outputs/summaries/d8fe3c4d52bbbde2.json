  "summary": "On June 14, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah entered final judgments in favor of the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe in a custody case involving an Indian child.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Salt Lake City, Utah, the court improperly deferred to a federal agency's interpretation of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA).  The complaint alleges that the court erred in determining that certain of the GAL's witnesses were qualified as expert witnesses because none of them were qualified to testify about the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Tribe.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Utah today announced criminal charges against three GAL witnesses for their roles in the alleged child abuse scheme.  The SEC alleges that, contrary to the BIA's recommendation, the juvenile court ultimately agreed to remove Child from mother's care based on the GOL's finding that the testimony of one of the witnesses was subject to therapist\u2013patient privilege.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against them from appearing or practicing before the court as an expert witness in any proceeding.  On June 21, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, charging them with violations of Section 13(b)(5) and 13(a)(2) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-2, and 13b-11 thereunder. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Steven H. Voorhees of the Salt Lake Regional Office and supervised by Scott A. Thompson. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS) and the Utah Department of Health and Human Services (SDHS) in this matter."
