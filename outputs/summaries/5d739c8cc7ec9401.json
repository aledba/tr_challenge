  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada today entered a final judgment against a company that failed to defend its insurance policy in a personal injury action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Las Vegas, Nevada, alleges that, from at least 2013 through at least 2016, Blue Streak Auto Detailing, LLC (Blue Streak), a mobile auto detailing business, was liable for a breach of its duty to defend.  According to the complaint, the company failed to protect its insured when it refused to defend against an insurance company's breach of duty to protect.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the company did not pay the full amount of the judgment or settlement it was entitled to, and instead, the insurer is liable for any additional costs incurred by the insured in mounting a defense.  As a result of the insurer\u2019s failure to defend, it is not entitled to the entire amount of judgment awarded against it in the underlying litigation.  For example, the SEC alleges that when an insurance policy is breached, the liability of an insurer is capped at the policy limit plus any costs and attorney fees incurred by an insured.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of $18,050,183 plus prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Further, the court granted the defendants the right to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, without requiring the insurer to pay a penalty, and to pay civil penalties in the event of a default judgment.  On the other hand, the Court found that the obligation to defend was purely contractual and a refusal to defend is considered a violation of the duty to indemnify.  Among other things, the majority of the court held that liability for a liability to defend arises solely from the nature of the insurance policy, not from the amount of a judgment that the insurer has breached, and that it is obligated to pay the costs incurred in the insured's defense. The court also found that liability to the insurer arises when an insurer does not perform its obligations as required by the policy, and is liable as to liability for any other loss caused by the insurer.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering to invest in an investment"
