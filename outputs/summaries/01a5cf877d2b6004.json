  "summary": "On March 11, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington entered a final judgment against Glacier Fish Company, LLC (\"Glacier Fish\"), a Washington company that owns and operates fishing vessels.  According to the court's order, on September 20, 2016, while working as a processor aboard one of Glacier Fish's vessels, the C/P NORTHERN GLACIER, Mr. Becerra complained of significant medical ailments, including pain, numbness, and weakness in his back, neck, and on the left side of his body.  The court also found that, over a year after filing his state court action, he delayed filing his federal declaratory judgment action by almost a year.  In a parallel action, Glacier Fish filed a civil injunctive action on September 24, 2018, against the company for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court also granted Glacier Fish the right to request a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an expedited hearing of the complaint.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., charges Glacier Fish with violations of Section 13(a) and 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 13a-14, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  It also seeks a court-ordered injunction, an injunction, and the appointment of a receiver.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018 WL 5276587, at *1. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
