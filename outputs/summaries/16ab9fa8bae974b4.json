  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered final judgments against Lynn Tony Clark, Jr., a second-felony habitual offender, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bienville, Louisiana, alleges that Clark violated the mandatory minimum sentence provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Clark was sentenced to 20 years at hard labor on the conviction for armed robbery with a firearm and 10 years at home with a gun, with those sentences to run concurrently.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Clark.  Clark has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Clark agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a permanent injunction, to a conduct-based injunction, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.  He also agreed to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with an offering of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of imprisonment.

Additionally, the court granted Clark's request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 15 of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 12b2-3 thereunder and ordered Clark to comply with the requirements of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 15(a).  The court also granted Clark the opportunity to apply for a hearing and to consider the merits of the case before it was decided by the court.  For further information, see Alabama v. Pearce, supra, and Louisiana v. Smith, supra.  This case was investigated by the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of"
