  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California today entered a final judgment against defendant Pablo Salinas-Jacobo for misconduct in jury deliberations.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sonoma, California, alleges that, on November 8, 2015, the jury deliberated for two full days before being discharged for failing to perform his or her duties as a juror.  According to the complaint, as a result of the jury's deliberation, the juror was unable to determine whether he or she was going to follow the court\u2019s instructions and could not reach a verdict on all of the charges.  In addition, the complaint alleges that one juror told the court that he did not consider the concept of punishment when deliberating with the jury, and that he was simply trying to convince the jury that there was a reasonable basis for the jury to convict him of a serious charge.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the jurors deliberated until the final judgment, when the jury was told that the jury had reached a unanimous verdict on the charges of murder and vehicular manslaughter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint filed in the federal district court in San Diego, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director and penny stock bars.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendant, charging him with violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 10a-5 and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and a conduct-based injunction prohibiting the defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of securities in the securities of any broker, dealer, municipal, or municipal securities dealer.  On March 19, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the San Diego District Court entered a judgment against Sansone, ordering him to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 13 of the Exchange Act and ordering Sansone to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  Sansone agreed to a $20,000 penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer and director of a public company"
