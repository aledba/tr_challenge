  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against B.E.G., the father of two children who were later terminated from parental rights.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the United States District Court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that on May 16, 2017, B. E.G. filed a petition in the Warren County Youth Court to terminate his parental rights, alleging that he was awarded custody and that a no-contact order had been entered against him.  According to the complaint, the court issued an order suspending the parental rights of both of the children.  In its order, the judge ruled that the termination of parental rights was void and that the court had the discretion to determine whether to grant relief under Rule 60(b)(4) or, alternatively, reopen the time for an appeal.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's order, BEDROOM has agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his legal fees.  On August 14, 2017 the court appointed a guardian ad litem to represent the children's best interest, which included the right to remain silent and to subpoena witnesses in order to make a report and recommendation to the court.  As part of the settlement, the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years. The court also agreed to appoint a temporary restraining order and to hold a hearing on August 21, 2017 to determine how to proceed with this matter.  A hearing was held on June 27, 2017 and the court granted the guardians' request for an emergency court order to halt the proceedings. The hearing was rescheduled for August 14 for a later date to make sure the parties understood the need for the court to consider the matter before proceeding with any further action.  BED ROOM agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from participating in any future securities laws violations, and orders him to provide financial assistance or any parental attention for either child for at least fourteen months. The judgment also prohibits him from associating with any person who has a history of drug or alcohol abuse, and from providing any financial or medical support for the child. The order also prohibits the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter or an application for a penny stock, and prohibits the payment of any civil penalty."
