  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Mark T., a Connecticut man who was previously convicted of a felony for his role in a September 2015 domestic violence incident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that, on September 9, 2015, the defendant, who was thirty-five years old, approached the victim's school to take her to an after-school program. According to the complaint, the victim refused to participate in the program because she did not remember the precise physical sequence of the altercation. The complaint further alleges that when confronted by a school psychologist and school staff member, Wilkos replied, \"I needed help with her, and I made an appointment to get her the help that she needed.\" The court granted the defendant's motion for a temporary restraining order, ordered the victim to come with him to the school, and allowed the defendant to testify that he sought help from a number of sources, including the department, but that no one was willing to help him. The court also allowed Wilkos to testify about the severity and urgency of the situation at home, and that, as a result, she had difficulty maintaining control of the victim. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Mark T. has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Children and Families, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
