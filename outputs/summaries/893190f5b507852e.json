  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against a Massachusetts-based software engineer who was terminated for his alleged participation in an age-based discrimination scheme.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston on January 15, 2016, Yury Rinsky was terminated by C&W Systems, Inc., a New York City-based company, on the basis of his age and disability.  The complaint alleges that Rinsky, then a resident of Massachusetts, was not required to show that he had been discriminated against by C &W because he was a member of the protected class.  Instead, the complaint alleges, Rinsky sought to convince the court that he was qualified for the job, receiving \"excellent\" performance reviews, and that he would be able to transfer to Boston if he had a reasonable basis for his termination.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Department of Justice today announced that it had issued an order suspending Rinsky from appearing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the SEC from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the SEC to pay civil penalties of $1,275,000 and $850,000, respectively, to Rinsky and his family.  On March 8, 2018, a federal district court in New York granted a temporary restraining order and ordered Rinsky to return to Massachusetts, where he will be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities for a period of five years, and requires him to pay a civil penalty of $425,000.  Rinsky agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a five-year officer-and-director bar, and to the appointment of a receiver to facilitate his repatriation and repatriation.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 24, 2018.  To learn more about age discrimination, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (January 17, 2018).
