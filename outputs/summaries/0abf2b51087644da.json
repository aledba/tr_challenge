  "summary": "On March 1, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against the city of Cleveland and its landmarks commission in an emergency action.  The court found that the Landmarks Commission lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over an appeal filed by a neighbor to the project.  According to the court's order, filed on April 12, 2017 and unsealed on May 24, 2016, the city and the state of Ohio violated the federal securities laws by failing to apply for a certificate of appropriateness for the construction, modification, and demolition of historic buildings within the city.  In its order, the court held that the BZA had jurisdiction to determine whether a project was appropriate for a landmark district, and that it had the authority to approve or deny any request for a zoning variance.  As alleged in the complaint, however, that the city did not have the jurisdiction to make such a determination, and the court did not consider the merits of the city's appeal.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The final judgments also order the parties to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000 and a $100,000 civil penalty, and require the defendants' return of any property they owned to be deemed to be of interest to the district court. The court also issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order temporarily freezing the assets of the defendants, preventing the destruction of any building or building, and ordering the destruction and alteration of any other building or structure. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Keltner and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The Office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan and the Federal Bureau of Investigation will lead the litigation. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Department of Commerce, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, the Florida Department of Insurance, the United Kingdom Department of Health and Human Services, the Swiss Federal Bank and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority."
