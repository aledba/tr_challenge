  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a Kendall County deputy who was charged with aggravated battery of a peace officer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in West Virginia, alleges that Deputy Bryan Harl observed a car pull over on the night of July 7, 2014. The complaint alleges that Harl ordered the driver of the car to stop kicking the officers, and then ordered her to roll over on her back and kick the officer. As alleged in the complaint, after Harl confronted the driver about her actions, the two officers began to tase the defendant. The SEC alleges that, despite being trained in persuasion and less inclined to use physical force, defendant continued to kick the officers and kick them, causing the officers' arm and leg injuries to be severe. The court also found that the officers were not trained on how to de-escalate a situation.  According to the SEC, Harl's actions were in response to a series of verbal and physical attacks by the driver, who he described as aggressive and aggressive. The defendants allegedly kicked the officers multiple times, including several times in the face and on the back of the head.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia today announced criminal charges against Harl.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Harls consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  On the same day, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Lechowicz, charging him with violating the antiterrorism provisions of the federal securities laws. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Ryan Hourselt and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State of Virginia, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
