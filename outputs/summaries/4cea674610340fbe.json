  "summary": "On February 7, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment in favor of the Illinois Secretary of State's Office and the Illinois Attorney General's Office in a parallel action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that on December 2, 2019, Jay Ramirez filed his nomination papers for the office of Democratic Ward Committeeperson of the First Ward of the City of Chicago, alleging that he had not submitted the required number of valid signatures. The board determined that, as a result, he had an insufficient number of signatures, which barred him from being on the ballot. The court also found that the Board of Election Commissioners' finding, which requires 1032 valid signatures, was inconsistent with the Board's finding. The complaint further alleges that the board's finding was unreasonable, arbitrary and not based upon the evidence.  In its final judgment, the court entered a temporary restraining order against Ramirez, freezing his assets, and ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest, and a civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, the Illinois Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
