  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Universal Health Services, Inc. and Psychiatric Solutions, Inc., a private psychiatric facility that treated and released a patient who later killed two persons.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, between November 2008 and January 2009, Amy Kern was an involuntary patient at Focus by the Sea (hereinafter \"Focus\"). The complaint alleges that she suffered from a series of psychotic breaks which resulted in violent conduct. According to the complaint, Amy was involuntarily committed to Focus for three separate occasions, and upon discharge from Focus on December 28, 2008, she was discharged from Focus for a third time by emergency room staff after threatening violence against her and her live-in boyfriend. The complaint further alleges that Amy was discharged on January 26, 2009, shortly after she was hospitalized for a second time after she threatened to kill her boyfriend with a tire iron. The SEC alleges that the Defendants violated their duty to care to Amy and her family by failing to provide timely and reasonable care to control her.  In a parallel action, on May 6, 2014, a federal district court in New York granted the SEC's motion for summary judgment against the Defendants, finding that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the Defendants to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $15,000 and $20,000, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval. The court also granted the defendants' motion to dismiss based on insufficient evidence to support their claims.  On May 8, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Amy Kern, seeking a judgment ordering her to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the charged securities laws and ordering Amy to return to Focus as a result of her release from custody. The Court granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Amy to comply with the order. The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt of the Atlanta Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Beverly A. Kern and Ms. Welshhans. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
