  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DOEQ) and its director for failing to adequately consider the potential health and safety impacts of a proposed coal-fired power plant.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buckingham County, Virginia, alleges that the Department of Energy and Department of Health and Human Services failed to adequately assess the potential impact of the proposed power plant on the predominantly African-American community of Union Hill, Virginia.  According to the complaint, the DOE's final permit analysis, which was submitted to the Board on January 8, 2019, failed to consider whether electric turbines could be used as part of a \"redefinition\" of the source.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that, in failing to consider the source of the problem, DEQ did not consider whether the power plant was a \"whole-house\" source, and that the DOE did not recommend that the project be converted to a \"cleaner\" source. The complaint further alleges that DEQ failed to properly evaluate the potential for disproportionate adverse impact on the community.  In a parallel action, the Virginia Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued an order suspending the issuance of a final permit for the project.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Secretary of Energy's Office of Inspector General has issued a Final Judgment that permanently enjoins the DOE from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-5 thereunder, and orders the DOE to conduct an independent review of the matter. The court will determine whether to issue a final judgment based on the findings of the independent review.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 24, 2019).  The Complaint also names as a relief defendant a Virginia-based agency that is required to conduct a BACT analysis of a potential power plant permit application. The Commission's Final Judgment also requires the Department to provide an explanation to the public about the nature of the potential harm to the community, including the safety of the equipment, the environmental impact of any proposed power project, and the adequacy of the permitting process. In addition, the Commission has agreed to the appointment of a receiver to determine whether a power plant is a \"safe\" site for the purpose of mitigating air pollution.  On January 9, 2020, the Board issued a final decision that permanently suspended the pending approval of the Virginia Power Station permit. The Board's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, orders the receiver to provide a \"clear and concise\" explanation of the possible impact"
