  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Second District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment in favor of a New London, Conn.-based company and its owner in a workers' compensation case.  The SEC's complaint, filed on September 19, 2012, alleges that, while employed as a mess attendant at the Coast Guard Academy, the company's owner and control person, Sharon Clements, suffered a serious head injury.  According to the complaint, Clements fell backward on the concrete floor and hit her head on the ground shortly before the start of her morning shift.  Clements' employer, Aramark Corporation, agreed to settle the SEC's action by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Clements to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Clements.  On September 21, 2016, the SEC issued an emergency action finding that Clements had violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws and ordered her to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, which is equal to her penalty of $100,000, and a $50,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the anti\u2013fraud provisions, ordering them to pay civil penalties of $10,000 each, and imposing a $75,000 officer and director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for October 13, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, No 1, and No. 17, July 13, 2013.  An examination conducted by the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations has been conducted in the office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, with the assistance of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Neer Zeevi and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Ms. Clements and Ms. Keltner. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Connecticut Office of Insurance Regulation."
