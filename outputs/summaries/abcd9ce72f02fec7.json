  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against the United States Attorney's Office for Texas for the Southern District of New York for the purpose of recovering stolen documents.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in El Paso, Texas, alleges that on or about November 14, 2013, a Customs and Border Protection officer detained Guadalupe \"Guadalupe\" Campos while she was in the country with her one-year-old child, Emmanuel Ochoa Perez, and her father, Jesus Perez. The complaint alleges that Campos, while still in prison, was falsely arrested and falsely imprisoned by CBP officers.

The Commission has also issued an Order suspending the issuing of an Enforcement Alert for Persons with Disabilities (EAD) in violation of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Rules of Order. The order also prohibits officers from conducting searches, seizing evidence, or making arrests for violations of the federal immigration laws. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Commission has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b2-1 thereunder, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.
