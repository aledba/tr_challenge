  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against defendant Jessie Marquez in a drug conspiracy case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that Marquez, a New Mexico resident, participated in a multi-pronged drug conspiracy involving over 500 grams of methamphetamine.  According to the complaint, Marquez and his co-conspirator, Robert Christner, convinced Christner to buy two pounds of methamphetamine for $3,200 as opposed to four pounds for $32,000. The complaint further alleges that, based on intercepted calls and text messages between Christner and Marquez that he received from Marquez during the course of his investigation, he knew that he was receiving methamphetamine from Christner.  In addition, the complaint alleges that when Christner confronted Marquez about the substance of the drug, he tried to find him a new supplier.  As alleged, however, the SEC found no evidence to support Marquez\u2019s claim that he had used a phone to facilitate the drug conspiracy.  Instead, the court found that the defendant had used the phone to communicate with Christner through a series of intercepted calls, including one in which Christner asked Marquez to \"find a guy with a little bit of methamphetamine\" and another in which he asked him to \"check out the guy with the little piece of methamphetamine.\"  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico announced criminal charges against Marquez.  On March 16, 2013, the District Court entered a temporary restraining order halting Marquez from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties.  Marquez also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his criminal conviction.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 24, 2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations, and Joseph G. Sansone, Regional Director of the Salt Lake Regional Office.   The litigation will be led by Amy Billhymer and Mr. Gibson."
