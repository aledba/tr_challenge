  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Mississippi yesterday entered final judgments against The Door Shop, Inc., a Mississippi-based electric-power company, and its former co-owner, Charles Bain, in a civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, from November 2004 to January 2011, the Door Shop sought to recover $36,081.86 of electricity from the Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC) by paying a $25,685.58 underbilled amount.  The complaint alleges that ACE failed to apply the correct multiplier to the MPSC's account, and that the amount owed was insufficient to recover the undercharged amount. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 77-3-3, ACE failed not to apply a \"rate\" when it received a supplemental bill reflecting the corrected amount owed (which, again, is not in dispute).  The court also found that, as a matter of law, ACE had exclusive jurisdiction over the matter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, ACE consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $10,396.28. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Middle Mississippi today announced criminal charges against the door shop. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Scott A. Thompson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson and Ms. Ciampi. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mississippi Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
