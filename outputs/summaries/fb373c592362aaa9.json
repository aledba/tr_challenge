  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against J.M., a California resident, for violating the mandatory age-appropriate treatment, services, and probation provisions of the federal criminal laws.  The court also found that, contrary to the stated intent of the previous court order, the current federal criminal law does not apply to juveniles in delinquency proceedings.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, from June 27, 2018 to December 4, 2017, the California Department of Juvenile Justice (\"DJJ\") issued a temporary restraining order halting the diversion of a juvenile defendant from participating in the adult criminal justice system.  In its judgment, the court found that DJJ violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a)(2)(A) and (b)(3)(B) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, DjJ consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins Djj from violating the federal securities laws and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The final judgment also orders the court to appoint a receiver to oversee the diversion program, which is subject to approval by the court.  On January 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCutchen of the District of Columbia issued an order suspending the diversion provision of the current adult criminal laws and ordering the receiver to conduct an independent review of the existing adult criminal statutes. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Division of Justice's Office of Advocacy and Advocacy."
