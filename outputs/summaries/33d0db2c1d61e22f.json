  "summary": "On March 8, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against Penneco Environmental Solutions, LLC (\"Penneco\"), an affiliate of Sedat, Inc. (\"Sedat\"), a Pennsylvania-based company that seeks to convert an existing gas production well into an underground injection well.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Pennsylvania on March 11, 2017, the Commission of Inspections and Examinations (Commissioners) issued a finding that, contrary to the Commission's findings, the ZHB did not consider the substantive validity of the zoning ordinance as a pre-condition to granting a permit to operate an underground well. The Commission's finding, however, was significant because, as alleged, the application was not ripe for review, and the Commission had not yet received federal and state permits to operate the well. In a parallel action, on March 29, 2016, the Court of Common Pleas of Pennsylvania issued an order requiring the Commission to consider whether to grant the Commission the right to review the application.  The Commission also issued an Order requiring that the Commission consider the merits of the proposed amendment to the amendment before it could issue a final decision on whether to issue an order granting the Commission a temporary restraining order.  In a separate action, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office (SPD) today announced related criminal charges. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs, the State Corporation Commission, the Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the PA Department of Environmental Protection, and other relevant authorities."
