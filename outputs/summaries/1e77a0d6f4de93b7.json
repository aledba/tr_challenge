  "summary": "On March 11, 2010, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of a property owner who rented out a lake house for short-term use.  The court found that, as a matter of fact, the property owner violated the restrictive covenants that govern the use of the property.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Michigan, on May 19, 2009, the estate owner, Cecilia L. Kaurich, who lives in a neighboring county, rented out the property to a variety of groups, including tourists, hunters, and business groups.  As alleged in the court order, the defendants violated the covenants because they did not have the right to rent the property for a specific purpose.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Michigan today announced criminal charges against the estate owners.    The SEC's complaint, filed on March 20, 2010 in U. S. District court for the Southern Division of Michigan, charges the estate with violating the restrictive covenant and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Estate Owner and the Estate Counsel have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the restrictive provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering the estate to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $50,000, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 571, 244 N.W.2d 206 (1914).  The Estate Counsel's Office has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0instant search tool\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Commerce, the State Attorney General's Office, and the Michigan Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
