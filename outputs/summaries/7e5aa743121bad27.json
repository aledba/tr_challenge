  "summary": "On April 24, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed an emergency action against Mississippi Manufacturers Association (MMAWCG) and its self-insurer guaranty association (GGA), alleging that the GGA improperly imposed an assessment on all of its members until the fund balance actually declined to $750,000.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that, in 2004, the Mississippi State Department of Insurance (\"GGA\") issued an opinion finding that it lacked jurisdiction to impose assessments on the MMAWCG because it had ceased operations as a self-insured group and ceased to operate as a group. The complaint further alleges that in 2006, GGA issued an assessment based on a partial default of its guaranty fund balance, which was insufficient to cover all of the claims and benefits arising from prior periods of self-Insurance. The Commission's order, which is subject to court approval, prohibited the imposition of an assessment until the balance of the fund actually declined.  In addition, the complaint alleges that GGA had continuing authority to impose an assessment even after it withdrew from the company.  According to the complaint, the Commission's October 6, 2015 order imposed a three-year \"trailing\" assessment on the group, which it deemed invalid because it was based on compensation and medical benefits paid during a full calendar year rather than a single six-month period.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's action, the MGA consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering it to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty. The settlement agreement, which GGA agreed to, was not subject to the court's order imposing an assessment, and GGA was not required to determine whether to impose such an assessment. The court ultimately ruled in favor of GGA on all three of those counts. The SEC is continuing its investigation into the matter. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley and supervised by Amy S. Cotter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mississippi Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Office of Insurance Regulation."
