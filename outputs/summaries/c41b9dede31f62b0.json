  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a medical malpractice case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Juan, Puerto Rico, alleges that Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz, his sister Olga and brother-in-law, misdiagnosed Zoraida d\u00edaz Casillas with jaundice and developed a severe skin condition.  According to the complaint, Jos\u00e9 D\u00cdaz, Olga D\u00c3az and Ramos agreed to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from calling expert witnesses at trial.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jos\u00e9 D'az.  On May 16, 2018, the Honorable Judge Gonzalo G. Currid granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order requiring the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000.  Separately, on June 5, 2017, the Court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, and ordered the parties to submit an errata sheet identifying any potential fact witness or expert witness who may be relevant to the litigation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2,500 each.  Additionally, the court granted the parties' request for an expedited hearing to determine whether to proceed with the litigation, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5141 (Docket No. 4221).  The Court also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert witness in the case of an emergency.  A hearing for the injured is scheduled for September 10, 2018. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
