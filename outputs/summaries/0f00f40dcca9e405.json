  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a default judgment against defendant Randal Tyson, his codefendant, Dulany Hill, and their alleged companies for breach of contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and aiding and abetting fraud.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in September 2015, defendant filed a second notice of removal on the same ground as the first, which was filed three days before the scheduled hearing on the motion to strike.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to what the court had previously ruled, defendant failed to respond to the complaint or to appear for a case management conference.  In a parallel action, on August 19, 2016, the court summarily remanded the case in default against defendant and ordered him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On September 23, 2016 and three days after the second notice was filed, Hill filed a third, identical to the first notice, but in a different location.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this second notice did not comply with the court's ruling, and instead served as an inappropriate responsive pleading timeline.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, defendants agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000.  Additionally, defendants have agreed to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.
