  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Pasha N. Walther, a former husband and wife living in Gretna, Louisiana.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Pasha Walther violated the antifraud provisions of Section 510(c) of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act by failing to find that Leilani had been in a relationship with Christopher Sawyer since early 2015.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that Christopher had been living at Christopher's house for approximately six months, and that he had moved to Gretna in 2014 to live with his daughter, Amber, and their daughter, Ashley.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Christopher.  Pasha has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Pasha agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 5b-5 and 5a-11 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil monetary penalty of $2500 per month, $3000 per month for a period of 5 months and $8000 per month in the amount of 91 months.  He has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On May 2, 2016, the court granted Pasha's request for a temporary restraining order against Christopher and ordered him to return to his home state of Louisiana, where he lives with his wife and daughter, and to pay $2500 a month in spousal maintenance. The court's order also prohibits Pasha from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in the securities of any broker, dealer, municipal, or municipal securities, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Christopher, charging him with violating Section 510 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b2-3 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 5 and ordering Christopher to disgorge illusory gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a $500,000 civil penalty to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  A hearing on May 24, 2016 was scheduled for 11:30 a.m."
