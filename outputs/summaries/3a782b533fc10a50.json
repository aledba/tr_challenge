  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Malden man accused of strangling his former girlfriend to death.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that, on August 10, 2012, the defendant and his girlfriend, Sharon Phillips, engaged in a long-running verbal struggle in their shared apartment. The complaint alleges that the defendant, who was also the victim's husband and father, repeatedly threatened the victim with a knife and threatened to harm her if she did not comply with his requests for a new trial. According to the complaint, after learning that the victim had been strangled to death by the defendant's knife, Phillips confronted the defendant with the threat that she would call the police. The defendant allegedly continued to do so, by his own estimate, for a few minutes, until he realized that he had strangled the victim. He then put the knife under his pillow and began to choke the victim, who became unresponsive and limp shortly thereafter. The SEC alleges that this conduct violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Phillips consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Massachusetts today entered final judgments against Phillips and Phillips in a related criminal case. The final judgments also order Phillips to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty. The case was investigated by the Boston office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Boston Office of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Mr. Phillips and Ms. Phillips.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office and the Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General."
