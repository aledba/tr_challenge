  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Texas-based healthcare fraud defendant who was sentenced to seventy-two months in prison.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, beginning in 2005, Mahmoud Rahim, a licensed clinical trial physician, fraudulently provided false testimony to the court in connection with his fraudulent kickback scheme.  According to the complaint, Rahim used this testimony to make it appear like Qadir was simply paying him kickbacks for office space when, in reality, he was simply writing prescriptions for unnecessary narcotics.  As alleged, the complaint further alleges that Rahim did not receive any kickbacks in exchange for his testimony, and instead relied on his own testimony during the bankruptcy proceedings and a bankruptcy examiner's report that summarized Rahim\u2019s statements.  Rahim also alleges that the court improperly used this evidence as a separate wrongful act to once again prove that he was a bad person who does bad things (such as write illegal prescriptions and commit healthcare fraud).  The complaint charges Rahim with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of kickbacks he received.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Rahim.  Among other things, the SEC charged Rahim in a parallel criminal case in which he was convicted on all counts of healthcare fraud and wire fraud, and charged with conspiracy to commit fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to pay and receive healthcare kickbacks, and receipt of illegal kickbacks.  On the same day, the court issued an order suspending Rahim from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert witness, ordering him to surrender his passport, and imposing a $1,000,000 civil penalty against him.  To learn more about fraud, see Litigation Release No. 597 (6th Cir. 2014).  In related criminal proceedings, the FBI and the U.K. Attorney's office for New Jersey today announced parallel criminal charges.  For example, in a related criminal case, the Department of Justice today announced that it has obtained a court order halting the asset freeze and freezing the assets of two former FBI officers. "
