  "summary": "On June 28, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of securities fraud in connection with the sale of a residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Michael J. Litvak, a former bond trader at Jefferies & Company, falsely claimed that he was acting as an agent when, in fact, he was not acting as a principal in the RMBS transactions.
