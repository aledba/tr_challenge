  "summary": "On May 12, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Naperville Rotary Charities, Inc. and Trident Interactive, LLC (Trident) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 28-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that from 2011 to 2016, Rotary operated the House of Dreams Charity Raffle for Rotary, including providing marketing and advertising services, and that Rotary and Trident were winners.  According to the complaint, from 2011 through 2014, the majority of the raffle proceeds were used to support Rotary's fundraising agenda and to cover expenses, including advertising and marketing expenses, and Rotary kept the winning bets and shared those proceeds with Trident.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2015 Rotary was not a winner under a predecessor to the Loss Recovery Act because it did not participate in the wager and did not have a stake in the outcomes of the games played on the site.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of $2,008,700, prejudgment interest of $1,128,926, and a civil penalty of triple the amount of their losses, and orders Trident to pay a $20,000 civil penalty.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, which is subject to court approval, and ordered Trident to comply with the court's order.  On May 24, 2018, the Court granted the parties' motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 2-615 of the Exchange Act and Rules 2-7, 8-11, and 13-13 thereunder, and granted them the right to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest and a penalty equal to 70% of the grand prize amount awarded.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5/28-8(b)(8) (West 2014).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against Rotary.   The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
