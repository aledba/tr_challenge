  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the city of Englewood, Colorado, and its officers in a civil injunctive action brought by Sandberg, alleging that several police officers, a city attorney, and a municipal entity violated his rights under the First, Second, and Fourth Amendments, as well as the Colorado Constitution.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver on May 14, 2014, Sandberg's complaint alleges that two officers, Robert Fieger and James Johnson, entered the auto shop and held Sandberg in a holding cell for approximately four hours. Sandberg allegedly told the officers that he was free to stay, and to have his vehicle serviced, as long as he refrained from handling his firearm while on the job. The complaint also alleges that Sandberg was not permitted to use his cell phone to record what he was doing, and that Johnson and Scheider did not check the serial number on the pistol before they detained Sandberg. The SEC alleges that the officers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933. The court agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying Sandberg\u2019s claims. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC is continuing its litigation against Sandberg and the other officers in this matter. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Burt of the SEC Enforcement Division."
