According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 5, 2017, Haruki Nakamura, a former professional football player who sustained multiple concussions while playing football, was diagnosed with a severe brain injury in 2013. The complaint alleges that, in 2013, he suffered an acute concussion that ultimately ended his football career.
