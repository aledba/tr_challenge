  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two defendants in a civil action brought by Lena Lee against Joseph M. Silveira and his company, Calico Custom Farming, Inc.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that on April 29, 2008, Lee was injured when her GMC Yukon collided with a manure spreader while negotiating a judgment that included an award for past medical expenses in the amount of $5,000, rather than the actual amount paid by the plaintiff.  According to the complaint, Lee agreed to settle the case by accepting a $1 million offer to compromise and agreeing to pay $887,098.26 in prejudgment interest and a $15,600 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, on August 18, 2011, the California Court of Appeals granted Lee's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the settlement to be subject to court approval.  On May 31, 2013, a federal district court in San Diego entered a judgment against the defendants, finding that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 998 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Lee consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1,027,014. The judgment also prohibits Lee from participating in any offering of a penny stock, and bars her from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Lee has also agreed to be barred from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal bankruptcy court, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  Separately, the SEC announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Lee, ordering her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains plus interest, and imposing civil penalties of $945,000 and $1.5 million, respectively.  A hearing on May 31 was scheduled for 10:30 a.m. for Lee to determine whether to vacate the judgment or to pay civil penalties against the other defendants.  As part of the settlement, Lee will be entitled to disgorgement plus interest and penalties equal to the amount paid to her in the civil injunctions proceeding against her.  For further information, see Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17(b)(2) thereunder, and Section 15(a) of"
