  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Sheila Ryan, a former registered representative of the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services, for her role in an administrative proceeding against a Chicago-area home builder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Ryan received a summons of service on or about July 26, 2016, from the director of the department of health and human services, stating that she had received a copy of the summons the day before. The complaint alleges that Sheehan failed to timely respond to the summons and instead served the summons on the builder and the new homeowner.  The complaint further alleges that the defendant did not hear the complaint and did not respond to her request for an administrative review.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Ryan, charging her with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) thereunder of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Ryan consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Novak and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Kogut. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
