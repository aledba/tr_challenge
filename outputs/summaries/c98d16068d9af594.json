  "summary": "On October 24, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Vincent \"Vince\" Snell, a former member of Ultimate Systems, Ltd., a company that produced colorized rubber products and end-user products such as rubber flooring.  According to the court's order, Snell agreed to pay $1.5 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount owed to Snell.  The court also entered a judgment against Snell that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil monetary penalty of $1,501,748.73 plus interest of $750,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Fanning consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest thereon, and imposing a $5,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Fanning.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, charges Snell with violating the securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after five years.  Additionally, the SEC is seeking a judgment ordering Snell to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2.8 million.  On November 21, 2018 the Umpqua County District Court entered a temporary restraining order against Fan and ordered him to return to the United Kingdom. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter.
