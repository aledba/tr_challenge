  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Social Security Administration, finding that Adelman was not entitled to Social Security disability benefits for the period from February 2002 through March 2003.  According to the SEC's complaint, Adelman, who is permanently disabled, began receiving childhood disability benefits based on his father\u2019s Social Security record in 1999. The complaint alleges that, at some point during his employment at SUNY at Stony Brook, the SSA terminated the benefits of Adelman for overpayment of Social Security benefits in April 2003. Adelman and his parents, acting pro se, raised the issue of whether Adelman owed the agency for overpayments in the period ending in March 2003, and why he should not be entitled to benefits thereafter.  The complaint further alleges that the agency failed to carry its burden to show that it was entitled to a reasonable determination of why Adelman should not receive benefits.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Secretary of Health and Human Services today announced that it has issued an order suspending Adelman from receiving disability benefits until it finds sufficient evidence to determine whether he is entitled to such benefits. The SEC also announced that the Department of Justice has issued a temporary restraining order against Adelman.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC has agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 2003).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Office of Vocational and Educational Services, which administers the program, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA) encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov website\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, OIEA issued an\u00c2\u00a0Order\u00c2\u00a0requiring\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0the Commission\u00c2\u00a0find\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0adviser to\u00c2\u00a0individuals with disabilities\u00c2\u00a0with\u00c2\u00a0history of\u00c2\u00a0disabilities\u00c2\u00a0having\u00c2\u00a0attempted\u00c2\u00a0a substantial gainful activity before\u00c2\u00a0we can find that\u00c2\u00a0you are no longer disabled.\u00c2\u00c2\u00a0We encourage investors to consider\u00c2\u00a0using the Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to identify people with disabilities who are particularly vulnerable"
