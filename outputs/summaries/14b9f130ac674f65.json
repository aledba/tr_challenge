  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against Doyle Edward Hitchcock, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for five counts of sodomy, six counts of endangering the welfare of a child, and two counts of forcible rape.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Springfield, Missouri on June 26, 2018, Hitchcock, then a resident of Ozark, Missouri, told his wife that he had been abusing her for years.  The complaint alleges that Hitchcock told her that he was going to make her afraid of him, and that he would hit her in the face with a can, like a trashcan, over her little brother's head.  As alleged in the complaint, the complaint further alleges that the defendant did not tell his wife about the abuse, and instead used a switch, a paddle, or a belt to hit her.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hitchcock.  On September 12, 2019, the court entered a temporary restraining order against Hitchcock and ordered him to be enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Hitchcock to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Hitchcock consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Missouri Department of Children's Services, and the Missouri State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
