  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against John Jerome Fontenot, a Louisiana man accused of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on June 17, 2014, in the United States district court for the Central District of Louisiana, Dr.Fontenot claimed that he had been unable to timely file an action to establish paternity of a child born during the marriage of Danielle Gotreaux Leger and Michael J. Leger, II.  The complaint alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, the one-year peremptive period of La.Civ.Code art. 198 is unconstitutional as it requires that the alleged father institute the action within one year from the date of the birth of the child.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, however, the defendant has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a $1,000,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On June 24, 2015, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the alleged perpetrator of the alleged paternity fraud, Michael Leger II, charging him with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Advocacy and Advocacy, with the assistance of the Division of Enforcement's Office of Child and Family Education. The litigation will be led by John R. Sansone and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the SEC Investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
