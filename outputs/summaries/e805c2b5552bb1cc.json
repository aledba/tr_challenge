  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia today entered a final judgment in favor of Crystal Trawick and against her former employer, Carmike Cinemas, Inc., on her Title VII sex-based wage discrimination claim, awarding her $67,117.79 for lost pay, $100,000.00 for emotional pain and mental anguish, and $1 million in punitive damages.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Atlanta on December 19, 2019, Trawicks' motion for a partial judgment against Carmike, which was entered on December 21, 2018, was denied on the basis of insufficient evidence presented to the court.  The court's order, which is subject to court approval, also prohibits defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and requires defendants to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million and $2 million, respectively, for each of those violations.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against T.R. Kelly, who was also a defendant in the Commission's action.  On December 22, 2020, the Honorable Rebecca M. Welshhans entered a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and ordering her to pay $1,050,790.91 in attorney's fees and $799,500 in civil penalties, and ordering the defendants to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and pay a $2,248.26 civil penalty.  A hearing on December 24, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. EST. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Atlanta Field Office, and the Georgia Office of Financial Regulation in this matter.
