  "summary": "On October 10, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Pei Pei Cheng-de Castro, Esq., Director of Investigations and Enforcement at the New York State Joint Commission of Public Ethics, which is charged with receiving, investigating and taking action against lobbyists or clients of public officials who have violated the restrictions on gifts to public officials.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that in commencing a substantial basis investigation of the petitioners, the Commission issued a non-party subpoena in December 2016, which requested documents and information in connection with the Commission's investigation. The subpoena also requested that the Commission send a written response within sixty calendar days after the Commission received the subpoena. The Commission's response, which was approved by the court on May 22, 2018 without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, stated, \"The Commission has no statutory authority to initiate an investigation of a potential violation of the federal securities laws.\" The Commission has never before communicated that it had any jurisdiction to determine whether the Commission had committed any violations and requested more information. The complaint also alleges that the commission did not have the ability to subpoena or compel a response from petitioners. In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of the delay in obtaining the subpoena and the subpoena, the commission has no jurisdiction to conduct an investigation.

The court also issued an order requiring the Commission to comply with the court's order, ordering the SEC to conduct a conduct-based investigation, including an examination of potential violations of Section 94(13)(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and ordering the Commission not to violate the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rules 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On May 16, 2019, the court granted the request for an officer and director bar, and ordered the commission to provide a copy of the complaint to the court. The order also ordered the Commission"
