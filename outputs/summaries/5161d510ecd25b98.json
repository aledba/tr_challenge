  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found incompetent to represent himself in a criminal case.  The court entered a temporary restraining order on August 22, 2017, freezing the defendant's assets and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, John Dunn was arrested on July 9, 2014, and charged with securities fraud and other securities fraud. The court found that Dunn had a history of acting as an unregistered broker-dealer and that he had been falsely told by two doctors that he was competent to counsel and could assist in his own defense. The Court also found that, contrary to what the court had previously ruled, Dunn had no history of having a mental disease or a mental defect, and had been unable to defend himself in court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Dunn.  Dunn pleaded guilty in a parallel criminal case and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mathis of the Fort Worth Regional Office and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Mr. Appellant. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Department for the Eastern District of Texas, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Arkansas Secretary of State's Office.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
