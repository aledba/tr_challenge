  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Mark Garner, a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for five drug-related convictions.  According to the SEC's complaint, Garner was arrested in October 2018 while working on a car with two other people, one female and one male, and was later arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance.  The SEC alleges that Garner told a police detective that he was going to search the house and found marijuana and related paraphernalia in the living room and dining room, and that he had access to a nightstand that contained a marijuana plant.  As alleged in the complaint, however, Garner had no access to the nightstand and did not possess the marijuana or the other materials recovered from the car.  In addition, Garner allegedly told the detective that the marijuana plant was in plain view in the bedroom, that he knew about the plant growing in the shed on the property, that his girlfriend was in the house, and he had a reason to be angry because of the person he was looking for.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Garner consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 civil penalty.  Garner also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On May 2, 2019, the court entered an order permanently enjoining Garner from violating Section 5 of the federal securities laws, ordering him to surrender his passport, pay a $75,000 penalty, and have his house and car inspected.  Additionally, Garner agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any drug, including, without limitation, possession of any controlled substance, with the right to a jury trial to determine the amount of restitution to be determined by the court upon motion of the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-64-215 (Supp. 2019).  The Court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order against Garner and ordered him to return to the United States to be subject to court approval of the proposed order."
