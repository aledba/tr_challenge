  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and imposing a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Ubrona Coger violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants.  In its order, the SEC also instituted an administrative proceeding against the Defendants, which is intended to determine whether the defendants are entitled to a permanent injunction, an order appointing a receiver, and an officer-and-director of a public company.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and orders them to pay a civil monetary penalty of $10,000. The Defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any public company, and to be restrained from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Robert C. Hannan. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
