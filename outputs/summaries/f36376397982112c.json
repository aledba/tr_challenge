  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Nicholas Souders, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison in 2003 for a string of felony drug-related charges.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, in 2003, the state of Colorado issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) preventing Souder from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the TRO had failed to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of post-conviction counsel.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2014, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi issued an order suspending Souds from appearing or practicing before the court as a trial attorney.  According to the SEC's order, filed on September 24, 2018, SoudERS, who was a resident of Honduras, had previously been convicted of a felony for driving with a revoked license and sentenced to a mandatory range of sixteen years to life imprisonment under the federal securities laws.  As alleged in the complaint, however, he had previously obtained a plea offer and guilty plea in a petty-theft case, which he accepted without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  Without admitting to the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of his sentence.  On November 22, 2013, the court granted the SEC request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered the asset freeze to be temporarily halted pending a court determination on the merits of the case.  Last week, the Court granted the request for a temporary asset freeze, ordered a hearing on the matter, and appointed a receiver to determine whether to proceed with the proceeding.   The court also issued a preliminary injunction, which prohibits the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter, from furthering or increasing violations of federal law, and from further aiding or abetting a defendant's violations of antifascrimination provisions.  Finally, on December 6, 2018 the court issued a final opinion ordering the asset freezes to be permanently enjoined from further violating the charged sections of the securities laws, ordering the issuance and purchase of a copy of the SEC order, ordering a hearing in which the court will consider the issues raised.
