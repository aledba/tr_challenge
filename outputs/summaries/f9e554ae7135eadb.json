  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri on June 11, 2019, entered a final judgment in favor of a motion to compel arbitration of claims for damages brought by Paul D. Melnuk, his former business partner.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, alleges that, on April 8, 2015, Hillman submitted a written proposal to Hillman, offering to pay $287,167 as a contingent liability adjustment under the \"change of control\" provision of the \"Phantom Option Plan.\" The complaint alleges that Hillman replied, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, that he was collaterally estopped by the 2016 Arbitration Award from compelling a second arbitration. The complaint further alleges that the arbitration award was not authorized by the Arbitration Agreement, and that Melniuk and Hillman did not qualify for arbitration because the arbitration agreement contained delegation clauses requiring threshold questions of arbitrability to be submitted to an arbitrator. Instead, the complaint alleges, the arbitrator must determine whether the arbitration is valid.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, in a parallel action, on June 12, 2018, a federal court entered a temporary restraining order against Hillman from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted an investigation that was conducted by the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Attorney General's Office in this matter."
