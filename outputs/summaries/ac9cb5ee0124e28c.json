  "summary": "On August 20, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri entered a final judgment in favor of terminating parental rights to S.R.H. (\u201cChild\u201d) on the basis of multiple factors, including: (i) a history of severe and recurrent acts of abuse toward the child, (ii) a long history of being unfit to parent her children, (iii) an extensive criminal history dating back to 1987, and (iv) having been incarcerated on child abuse and neglect charges for the past year, (iv), and (v) a prior felony conviction for medical neglect.  The court also found that, prior to or after incarceration, Mother had provided Child with non-prescribed medications, which she had not been prescribed, and that she had a \"very extensive child abuse/neglect history involving the states of Arizona, Texas, Tennessee, California, and Missouri.\"  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's judgment, Mother consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating Section 211.447.5(3) and orders her to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Mother.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, the court found that Mother violated the antifraud provisions of Section 211 and ordered her to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years. The court granted the court\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order against Mother and ordered a hearing on the matter on August 21, 2019.  On August 24, 2019 the court entered an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to terminate the parental rights of all six children under the age of 17. The receiver will determine the appropriate amount of money to be distributed to the receiver.  A hearing on August 26, 2019 is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Eastern."
