  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the American Bar Association.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Antonio, Texas, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to adequately disclose to the court that, in addition to physical and psychological trauma, they suffered from pre-existing trauma, including panic attacks, poor medical care, depression, and anxiety.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants have consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In addition, the court has ordered the defendants to provide a copy of the Judgment, which is subject to court approval, to the Department of Homeland Security's request for a temporary restraining order, and to provide an accounting of the amount of time spent in detention.  Additionally, the Court has issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before immigration courts as part of a case-by-case review of the immigration detention policies.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Sonia S. Gordon of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of San Antonio entered an order permanently enjoining the Defendants from violating the anti-deterrent provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering the issuance of an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue a bond hearing for a class of asylum seekers, and ordering the release of any additional class members deemed likely to be in imminent danger of being harmed by the alleged violations of Section 5(b).  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Ingrid Eagly and Stephen Shafter, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the San Antonio Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Higgins and Ms. Gordon. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mexican Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mexican Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Mexican Secret Service). \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage people to check the backgrounds of people who are being held in immigration detention by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0checker.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0"
