The SEC's complaint, filed on July 2, 2014, alleges that Security National Guaranty, Inc. (SNG) and Edmond Ghandour, SNG's president and chief executive officer, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants agreed to settle the case by agreeing to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.
