  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a Missouri woman who filed an employment discrimination action against her former employer.  The SEC's complaint, filed on February 22, 2019, alleges that, on November 21, 2017, a clerical error on Case.net caused her to miss a hearing to determine whether she had been formally dismissed from her employment discrimination case.  According to the complaint, Dr. McGuire then filed an amended petition, asserting that the system had removed two of the defendants on her case, and showed the \"party end reason\" as \"Party Released/Endeded.\"  The complaint further alleges that the error was caused by a state or local official acting \u201cunder color of state law.\u201d  The court also found that, in imposing the burden upon the defendant to show the right to hold the parties accountable for with convincing evidence, the judge did not do that.  In addition, the court found that the defendant had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of an amended complaint, which was filed with the court on February 23, 2019.  On February 24, 2020, the Court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Rule 10a-5, and ordered the court to consider the merits of the action.   The Court also issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering the judge to provide an accounting of the defendant\u2019s conduct in a civil proceeding.  To determine whether to proceed with the litigation, see Litigation Release No. 559 (Feb. 22, 2020).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Missouri Division of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office, and the Missouri Attorney General's Office in this matter."
