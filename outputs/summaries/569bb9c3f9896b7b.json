  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Circuitronix, LLC (\"Circuitronix\"), a company that, among other things, manufactures and distributes various electronic components, including printed circuit boards and PCBAs.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Kapoor, who, according to the court's order, violated the anti-fraud provisions of the settlement agreement.  According to the order, filed in federal district court in New York, Kapoor agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In its order, the court found that Kapoor violated the antifraud provisions in the Settlement Agreement and that he was liable to disgorge $1,000 in ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000.  It also ordered Kapoor to pay disgorgement of $2,038, and a $500,000 civil penalty.  On August 21, 2018, the Court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered a hearing on the matter to determine whether to proceed with a permanent injunction.   The SEC's order also ordered the court to consider Kapoor's offer of a partial judgment against the company, ordering a hearing in which he will be sentenced in a matter of weeks, and ordering the company to pay a $1 million civil penalty in the amount of $150,000, which will be determined by the court at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida."
