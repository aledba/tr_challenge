  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against the Bakers and Thomas parties in a civil action brought by them in 2004.  According to the SEC's complaint, Ms. Zanders and her husband, Joseph Reid, were in a romantic relationship when Mr. Reid bought a house for them to reside in, fix up, and make mortgage payments on.  The complaint alleges that, in 1997, Zanders wanted to purchase a property at 311 T Street in Northwest D.C.  She sought to obtain a mortgage for the property in his name and transfer title of the property to her in her own name.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the court had erroneously dismissed her claims for breach of contract and promissory notes, and instead granted her nominal damages based on her failure to provide a written statement of interest in the property.  In a second complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington state, the SEC alleges that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Act Section 15(a) and Rule 17a-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the Exchange Act, and ordering them to pay $210,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $20,000 and $10,000, respectively.    The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to be wary of investing in risky investments, including those that are speculative and speculative."
