  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against defendant Lorenzo Darnell Roy in a civil action brought by the SEC against him.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Springfield, Missouri, alleges that Roy violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from April 9, 2014 through April 10, 2014, Roy and his sister, Brenda Boykins, went to breakfast at Hardee\u2019s, where they allegedly found a pair of yellow rubber gloves turned inside out, a large kitchen-style butcher knife, and a trash bag with a knife blade sticking out of it. Roy allegedly told the woman that he was in the practice of \"ripp[ing] off] a drug dealer\" and that he had just called 9-1-1. The complaint further alleges that Boykins told Roy that she was going to take it to a friend's house to use the drugs.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Roy.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Roy consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The judgment also prohibits Roy from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, other than for the purpose of obtaining a preliminary injunction against future violations.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Sansone of the U. S. District court for the Western District of New York entered a judgment against Roy against him, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering him not to participate in the offering of a penny stock. The court also ordered Roy to pay disgorgement of $2,500, which is equal to the amount of his civil penalty, and ordered him to be barred from the securities industry.  To settle the SEC case, Roy has agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri State Attorney General's Office, and the Missouri Department of Criminal Justice."
