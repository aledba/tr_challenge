  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Jayvious Johnson, Dbryus Story, Jamario Hodges, and Favian Vaughn in a parallel criminal case.  According to the SEC's complaint, from approximately 2:00 a.m. on November 12, 2013, Tavoris Marshall and her then-seven-year-old grandson, Stanley Self, were shot and killed in their home.  The SEC alleges that Johnson, Story, and Hodges told Self that they were going to steal a gun from Marshall's house and that they would use it to \"hit a lick\" at Marshall. The complaint further alleges that Self and Story were in the car at the time of the murders when they were confronted by a group of men who demanded that they surrender their guns and surrender their lives.  Johnson allegedly told the men that he was going to hit a lick, and that he would use the gun to kill his little cousin.  Instead, the complaint alleges, Johnson and Story lied to the court and told the court that they did not have any difficulty test firing the gun, that they had no difficulty testing the gun when it was fired, that the gun was in the wrong place at the wrong time, that Gorman had been shot in the head, that he had been threatened by a family member who threatened him with a gun, and, most significantly, that Self was scared for the safety of his family member.  In a parallel case, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Johnson.  On October 12, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Johnson, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Johnson's and Story's violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-2 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221."
