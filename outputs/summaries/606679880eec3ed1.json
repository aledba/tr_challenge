  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Jeremiah Ray Hart and Erick Burwell, who are charged with orchestrating a multi-pronged scheme to steal drugs from dealers.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Hart and Burwell schemed to steal up to five pounds of marijuana from dealers, including two brothers who were victims of the alleged sexual misconduct.  According to the complaint, Hart prepared for the heist by borrowing a 9mm Glock handgun from his cousin, who had access to Hart\u2019s legal papers in their shared cell.  As the complaint alleges, Hart used the Glock to carry out the scheme.  In one instance, Hart allegedly told a co-defendant that he shot someone and that he did not know who shot him.   The complaint further alleges that, after Hart was arrested, Burwell allegedly confronted Hart about the alleged misconduct, telling him that he had a clear strategic basis for failing to move for a mistrial when he knew that the other gun in the possession of Hart was not related to this case.

To settle the case, Hart also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in any future solicitation of the sale of or purchase of a firearm, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Additionally, Hart agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and be permanently barred from associating with any third-party law violator.  After the settlement was reached, Hart pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.  A jury deliberated for three days before finding Hart guilty on all of these charges.  Among other things, the court found that Hart was ineffective in failing to provide timely and reasonable assistance to the defense.  For example, in his first interview with the SEC, Hart told the defendant that he believed he had been shot by a convicted felon, but later decided not to participate in the investigation because he had"
