  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming today entered a final judgment against a Wyoming man who was held in contempt of court for violating a court order requiring him to relinquish custody of his daughter, EP.  According to the court's order, filed on February 23, 2015, Mitchell, as an enrolled member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, filed a civil contempt proceeding against a Sheridan County district court for imposing a five-year prison sentence.  The court found that Mitchell was in civil contempt because he failed to comply with the court order and was not entitled to credit for the time he spent in presentence confinement.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Wyo. today announced criminal charges against Mitchell.  Mitchell has consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the federal and state criminal laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of time he has already served in custody.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Mitchell has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment that permanently restrains his rights as a defendant in a civil proceeding, imposes a mandatory minimum sentence of three and one-half years of imprisonment, and bars him from participating in any form of pre-judgment proceedings.  He has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On November 3, 2017, the Honorable John G. Fenn of the Wyoming District Court entered a judgment ordering him to be restrained and restrained until he fulfills his obligations under the federal, state, and federal criminal laws.  To learn more about the double jeopardy provisions of the federal criminal law, see Litigation Release Order No. 17-cv-01-17 (Washington, D.C. 2017).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wyoming Department of Corrections, and the Wyoming Office of Inspector General."
