  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 5, 2019 entered a final judgment in favor of terminating the parental rights of B.M.M., a child born in May 2017, to her dependent child, C.B., pursuant to the Adoption Act of 1940.  According to the court's order, filed on November 14, 2018, Appellant, through his attorney, Terry O'Hara, an expert in forensic psychology, and his case assistant, Kierstin Whysong, raised the issue of whether the pendency of the child's criminal charges warrants termination of parental rights.  The court found that, contrary to the pre-judgment judgment, Appelant failed to adequately maintain the relationship between the child and her mother.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against both defendants.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, prior to the filing of the petition, the child was removed from her mother's care and placed in the care of her father, who was eventually charged with serious criminal offenses.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 2511(a)(5), (a)(8) and (b)(3) of Exchange Act Rules 10a-14, 13a-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder. The judgment also prohibits Appelants from acting as an unregistered broker or representative of a public company, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 or $20,000, respectively. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Way Parent Education Program, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services."
