  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who agreed to pay restitution in the amount of $682,600.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Greeley, Colorado, alleges that A.V. violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendant agreed to the restitution order based on the stipulated facts, without admitting or denying the allegations, that he caused the Country Inn fire and to pay $470,874.47 in restitution to the victims of the dismissed counts.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in a plea agreement and at the sentencing hearing, he agreed to be ordered to pay a total of $681,600 in restitution, including $1.3 million for the fire-related damages, and $8119.20 for the insurance company's expenses.   The complaint also alleges that he failed to disclose to the court that he was in the backyard of the home during the burglary and provided details of other burglaries in the same general area.  Finally, the court found that the defendant had not caused the fire and did not otherwise hedge her restitution request based on an objection to paying any restitution.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Colorado today announced parallel criminal charges against the defendants.  This case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, John R. Rymas, and Eric R. Werner of the Denver Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Department of Insurance, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Denver Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice Criminal Division's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and the Colorado Office of Financial Regulation."
