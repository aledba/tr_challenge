  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Gloria Mitchell, who was convicted of felony child abuse in 2015.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least September 2016 through September 2017, Mitchell engaged in a pattern of conduct that included verbal abuse, physical abuse, and domestic violence.  According to the complaint, from September 2017 through September 2016, defendant and his sister, John Doe 1, allegedly engaged in verbal and physical abuse of a minor, including physical abuse.  As alleged, defendant used a back scratcher, a switch, and an electrical cord to pull at John Doe's genitals, causing him to cry.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant and John Doe 2 engaged in physical and verbal abuse of the same nature, with the alleged intent to inflict permanent injunctive relief on the victim.  During the course of the trial, Mitchell consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Mitchell agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a $100,000 civil penalty.  Mitchell also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
