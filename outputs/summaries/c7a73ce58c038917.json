  "summary": "On January 8, 2019, the Honorable Jose E. Martinez of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other emergency relief.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that, on December 1, 2015, Jonnathan Ramos, a Florida resident, made an unauthorized phone call to his personal phone number, causing him temporary deprivation of his phone, invasion of privacy, waste of time, and disruption to his daily life.  According to the complaint, the call was made through an automated telephone dialing system, and the text message was not part of the agreement.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that the call violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the complaint is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Ramos consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Ramos.  On January 24, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Ramos, charging him with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint also named New Eng. Auto Fin., Inc., a Florida-based auto lender, as a defendant in violation of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar against all defendants, as well as a penny stock bar against each of them.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 664-2, and Rules 15a-3, 13a-11, 13b-13, 13c-14, 13d-1, and 12d-13 thereunder.  Separately, in a related administrative proceeding, the Commission issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent examination of any claims that arise from a complaint filed by a person who has been injured or otherwise harmed by an injury or other serious matter. The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael Etienne and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Miami Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service"
