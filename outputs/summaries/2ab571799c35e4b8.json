  "summary": "On October 17, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against the Illinois Labor Relations Board, State Panel, and Department of Central Management Services, as representative for the Department of Employment Security (IDES).  The court found that the Board violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1210.170(a) of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act and Rules 1210-170(b) and 1310-11 thereunder.  The Court also found that, contrary to the Board's finding that the positions at issue were managerial, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether the positions were managerial within the scope of the employer's policies and practices.  In its order, the court held that the unit clarification petitions were procedurally appropriate on the basis that they sought to remove alleged managerial employees from the bargaining unit.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Board agreed with the court that the units clarification petitions violated the federal securities laws, and that it should not be allowed to be filed in the union's bargaining unit until a new contract is negotiated with the employer. The court also ruled that there was no conflict of interest in filing the unit clarifications petitions.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Chicago, Illinois, on September 2, 2016, the Illinois Department of Labor's (IDLS) Board of Directors (Board) issued an order requiring the Board to consider unit clarification petition applications for vacant positions. The Board's order also required IDLS to submit a written opinion, which was reviewed by the Board and approved by the court by the staff of the Division of Health Facilities & Services. The order also provided for the appointment of a unit clarification committee to consider the merits of the case.  On October 18, 2017 the court granted the request for an administrative review by the Illinois Secretary of State's Office and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary of State) in a related administrative proceeding. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Illinois State Department of Education (DDEA) in this matter.
