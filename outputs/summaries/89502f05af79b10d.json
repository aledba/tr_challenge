  "summary": "On January 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment in favor of the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office's motion for summary judgment against Michael Prentice Handley in a related criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that Appellant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from August 27, 2015 through September 2015, a Pennsylvania state trooper responded to a call about a suspicious odor of marijuana emanating from a Pennsylvania residence. The trooper allegedly observed marijuana leaves and stems protruding from holes in a garbage bag outside the home. The complaint alleges that the trooper confronted the man and told him that he was going to get his gun and \"go in and get it.\" The trooper complied, and the officer was arrested. The SEC alleges that, in a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office today announced that it had obtained a temporary restraining order and issued a search warrant for the residence, outbuildings, curtilage, and camper. The court granted the SEC's request for a summary judgment, entered by consent, and entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the officer from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of five years and a $10,000 civil penalty. The order also prohibits Appellants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any medical marijuana product, including medical marijuana, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The Court also ordered the officer to provide a copy of the court's order, which is subject to court approval.  In its order, the court also entered a partial consent judgment in the matter.  On January 17, 2019, the Court issued a preliminary injunction, entered a default judgment, and issued an order suspending the officer-in-waiting from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  Without admitting the allegations of the complaint in the court order, Appelant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal, state, and local securities laws. The final judgment orders the officer in the case to comply with the order and pay a penalty equal to the amount of his or her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court at a later date. The settlement is pending final approval by the Court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221."
