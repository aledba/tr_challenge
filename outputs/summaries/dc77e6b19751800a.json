  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New York City-based special education teacher who was previously barred by the Department of Education (DOE) from serving as a substitute teacher.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, from 2012 to 2014, Jennifer A. Johnson, a resident special education education teacher at Richmond Hill High School in Richmond Hill, New York, received \"ineffective\" ratings on all four required observations of her performance for the 2014-15 school year.  According to the complaint, Johnson, who was employed as a permanent substitute teacher in the school's special education department, was not aware of her termination when she contacted respondents about her termination.  Johnson also allegedly received a \"satisfactory\" rating for the 2012\u201313 school year and an \u201ceffective\u201d rating in the 2013\u201314 school year, based solely on her performance and were not in retaliation for her complaints, because the administrators evaluating petitioner had no knowledge of her complaints.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Johnson consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. Johnson also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Education today announced that it has issued an order suspending Johnson from appearing or practicing before the Commission on Education Litigation.  On November 6, 2014, the Commission issued a written denial to Johnson's application for a reduction of her probationary period, which was not followed by a hearing on the Commission's motion for a preliminary injunction. The Commission's order, which is subject to court approval, also prohibits Johnson from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any class of any school or district for which the Commission has jurisdiction. Johnson has agreed to a permanent injunction and to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty. Johnson agreed to the appointment of a receiver and to a five-year conduct-based injunction. Johnson will also be barred from appearing and practicing as an attorney. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the New York State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
