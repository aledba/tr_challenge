  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against EnerNOC, Inc. and two of its officers, Eric Erston and Timothy Healy, for violating the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, the defendants violated the antifraud provision of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to pay the plaintiff the full amount of a commission that she had earned and by terminating the plaintiff when she complained about it, causing her to lose an additional commission.  The SEC alleges that the defendants also violated the \"lost wage\" provision of the wage act, which prohibits retaliation against an employee for seeking to enforce his or her rights under the law.  In its judgment, the court also found that, in violation of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, the amount of the commission due to the plaintiff that would have been due to her had she not been terminated.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $349,098.48, a penalty equal to the amount owed to the defendant under the true-up policy, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,038,065, and a civil penalties of $150,000 and $250,000, respectively.  On August 19, 2016, the jury found that EnernOC violated the wage and sales commission provisions of Sections 148A and 148B of the Exchange Act. The jury found the defendants liable for the above-mentioned violations and ordered Enernamo to pay $350,000 in civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael O'Brien and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Jennifer C. McKinley of the New York Regional Office, and was supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, with the assistance of the Office of Compliance. The investigation has been supervised by Scott A. Kasper, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and Antonia Chion of the Unit's Analysis and Detection Center."
