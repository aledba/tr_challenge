  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Boston, alleges that a defendant committed for substance use disorder treatment in violation of Section 35 of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the defendant was found with open beer bottles in his room, and a second bottle of Xanax in his possession.  As alleged, the juvenile allegedly used the Xanax to make frequent trips to the bathroom and to avoid being found by school staff.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant had used Xanax at least three times during his incarceration, and that, on at least one occasion, he turned off his cellular telephone and yelled at school staff in support of the drug test results.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 35, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest in the amount of his civil penalty, and bars him from participating in any future substance-use treatment program.  On September 25, 2019, the court entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  A hearing for the defendant on September 26, 2019 was conducted by Janice Hrabovszky, a licensed clinical trial clinician, and was supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Boston Regional Office. The hearing followed by a hearing on September 27, 2019. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Department of Justice, and the Massachusetts Office of Inspector General in this matter."
