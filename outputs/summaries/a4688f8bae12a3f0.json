  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a paternity action brought by Mona Lucio, her boyfriend at the time, Charles Dittig, against whom the court agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 25(812) of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Phoenix, Lucio and her boyfriend signed a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity on behalf of their son, C.D., in 2014.  The complaint alleges that although Lucio had informed her he was not the biological father, he did not wish to challenge the acknowledgment.  In a parallel action, the Arizona Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Brummond for his role in the alleged paternity scheme.   The SEC's Complaint alleges that, in a parallel case, the trial court improperly dismissed Lucio\u2019s paternity action on the basis of insufficient evidence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the anti-manipulation provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Arizona law, and ordering him to pay child support to Lucio for the purpose of recovering his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC also issued an order suspending the registration of any person or entity with an interest in establishing the paternity of a child under the age of 18 who has signed a petition for paternity with the intent of acquiring a copy of the birth certificate and signing the acknowledgment as part of a settled action.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC also instituted an administrative proceeding against Lucio to determine whether or not to proceed with a civil action against her.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Feb. 24, 2018).  The U. S. Attorney's Office for Arizona today announced that it filed a parallel criminal action against Dettig, charging him with violating Section 25-812(E) and Rule 85(C) and seeking a permanent injunction against further violations of that provision, as well as a conduct-based injunctive relief order.  A hearing is scheduled for May 13, 2018.  On May 16, 2018, the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations and ordered a hearing on May 17, 2018 to determine"
