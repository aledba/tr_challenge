  "summary": "On June 20, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Fifth District of Connecticut entered a final judgment against Lawrence Brunoli, Inc. (Brunoli) and its subcontractor, Mid-State Metal Building Company, LLC (Mid-State), in a workers' compensation case. The court found that Brunoli was a principal employer pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-291, and that it was liable to pay all compensation for the injuries that Dunkling sustained while repairing the worksite. According to the court's order, Brunoli had a contract with the state to construct a building at a worksite and had a right to maintain workers compensation insurance for a period of one year. Brunoli's subcontractors, Connecticut Metal Structures, LLC (\"Connecticut Metal\"), and Mid-States employed Brunoli to repair a leaking gutter at the workite. The complaint alleges that, on December 4, 2014, Dunkling was repairing gutters at Brunoli when he fell from a ladder and suffered injuries that required him to be restrained from using a ladder to repair the gutter. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Connecticut, charges Brunoli with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Brunoli.  On June 21, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court in New York City, alleging that the Compensation Review Board erred in finding Brunoli liable as an employer for payment of a worker's compensation claim for an injury received while at work. In its order, the court also ordered Brunoli and Connecticut Metal to pay a civil penalty of $16,675.26, which is equal to the amount of their compensation. The defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million, and orders Brunli to pay $2.2 million in restitution. The order also prohibits Brunoli from participating in any type of work that is not performed by the contractor or subcontractor and requires the subcontractor to provide the contractor with a ladder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented"
