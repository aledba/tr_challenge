  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a contempt order against a Chicago-area judge for filing a false complaint in a federal court against him.  According to the SEC's complaint, on February 10, 2017, Judge Joel G. Betar issued an order suspending Judge Shekar from appearing in court as a witness in a case brought by Bhavesh Doshi.  The complaint alleges that Judge Betar violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he failed to provide sufficient notice to the court that he would impose a penalty of no more than six months imprisonment if Shekar did not adequately support the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Shekar.  On March 24, Shekar pleaded guilty to criminal contempt of court and was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and ordered to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  Last week, a federal district court in Chicago issued a temporary restraining order and ordered Shekar to comply with the court's order, ordering him to sign a cease-and-desist order, and ordering the court to issue an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the receiver has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $150,000.  Shekar has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the public company or by participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any security in connection with the issuance of any such security order.  JudgeBetar also granted the receiver's request for an asset freeze.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David A. Dolan and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0"
