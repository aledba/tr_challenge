  "summary": "On January 18, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan entered a final judgment against Tony Jones, a former professional football player who suffered a shoulder injury while practicing for the University of Michigan football team.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on May 6, 2015, Jones was hired as an undrafted free agent to work as an operations assistant for a football team in Michigan. The complaint alleges that Jones suffered an injury to his right shoulder during football practice on August 23, 2015 and was required to work in a non-player football role with the team. Jones was not medically released or authorized to play professional football when he was injured and was placed on injured reserve. The SEC alleges that the deputy commissioner improperly assessed Jones\u2019s pre-injury earnings and did not release or authorize Jones to continue his professional football career.  The SEC further alleges that, in a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jones.  In its complaint, the SEC alleged that Jones violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the Commission violated Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Act Section 13(b)(2) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Jones consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $6,115.38 per week. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On January 19, 2019, the court entered a judgment ordering the SEC to issue an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering Jones to pay disgorgement of $2,500 plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $100,000 civil penalty. The court also issued an order requiring Jones to comply with the Commission's order, which requires him to provide a copy of the complaint to be filed with the SEC. The order also requires Jones to submit a written statement to the Commission stating that he has made great progress in recovering from his shoulder injury and that he would not have continued as a football player, much less use that assumption offensively against\u201d him. In addition, the order requires that Jones pay a $20,500 civil penalty and that Jones be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Jones agreed to the order and agreed to pay"
