  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 18, 2018, entered a final judgment against the United States Forest Service in a civil injunctive action brought by a former Forest Service employee who suffered second- and third-degree burns while sledding in South Lake Tahoe.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, the Forest Service failed to provide timely and accurate information to the public about the impending fire.  The complaint alleges that, in November 2015, while on a ski trip, Gianfranco Ruffino went sledding and experienced second-and-third-day burns when he was confronted by a fire that had been hidden from the public.  As alleged in the complaint, Ruffino was the only qualified burn boss supervising the Meow 175 fire, and he was not on site for the two days following ignition.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Ruffino.   The SEC's Complaint, filed on May 17, 2018 in U.N. District Judge Amy J. Bentsen, charges USFS with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, USFS has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 24, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone, Director of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, with the assistance of the Office of Inspector General's Risk Analysis and Detection Center.  On May 19, 2019, the SEC filed a Complaint against the Federal Bureau of Investigation for its role in this matter, alleging that USFS violated the mandatory and specific policies in the Interagency Prescribed Fire Planning and Implementation Guide (PMS 484) by failing to adequately assess the risk of a fire and failing to perform a public safety risk assessment. The complaint also alleges that the federal Bureau of Land Management failed to adequately inform the public of the risks posed by the fire and failed to timely respond to the requests for an accounting of the fire"
