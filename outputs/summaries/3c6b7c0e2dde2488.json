  "summary": "On April 8, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against defendant Ronald Herron, finding that, from the late 1990s until 2011, Herron headed a drug distribution and racketeering conspiracy centered around the Wyckoff and Gowanus Houses in Brooklyn, New York. The court found that Herron was a high-ranking member of the \"Murderous Mad Dogs Bloods\" gang (the \"MMDB\") and its control of the drug trade in the Wyckooff and Gowanus Houses, where he lived with his mother. The jury found Herron guilty of two felony counts of premeditated murder and one felony count of possession of a firearm in connection with a related drug-related murder. Herron has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains. The final judgment also orders Herron to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the FBI's New York Field Office, and the New York State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
