  "summary": "On March 15, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a Brooklyn man who was convicted of two felony counts of securities fraud.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Joe Pierre was falsely represented to the jury that he worked at a laundromat in uptown New York. The complaint alleges that, in reality, the defendant was on videotape committing the robberies. The SEC alleges that the defendant had a mask on and a pair of grey sweatpants, and that he had a gun in his pocket.  The complaint further alleges that defendant had no background in the criminal justice industry and was not trained to deal with the overwhelming evidence presented to the court.  As alleged in the complaint, Pierre had been on duty as an analyst for the Borough of Manhattan Community College and worked there for approximately nine years.  In a parallel criminal case, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Manhattan announced criminal charges against Pierre.  To learn more about ineffective assistance of counsel, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13 (March 26, 2018).  The SEC complaint charges Pierre with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The judgment also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and from making any offer to purchase or sell any security, including, without limitation, a copy of the Complaint, which is subject to court approval.  It also prohibits defendants from associating with any third party, including a registered representative, broker dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, or broker dealer.  On March 26, 2019, the court granted the motion for a temporary restraining order against Pierre, ordering him to surrender his passport, and barring him from appearing before the SEC as a trial attorney.  A hearing scheduled for May 24, 2019 is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. EST for May 25, 2019."
