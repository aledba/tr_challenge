  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against Gordon Reid, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 220 months, followed by three years of supervised release, for the crime of Interference with Commerce by Threats of Violence.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on March 16, 2015, Reid, who was incarcerated at the time of his release, alleged that BOP had failed to deliver his magazine subscriptions while he was confined in Special Housing Units (SHUs) at McCreary and other Bureau of Prisons (BOP) facilities.  The complaint further alleges that Reid had suffered a uniform set of deprivations at each SHU, thus failing to adequately assess whether the alleged policy posed a realistic threat to the plaintiff.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, having been incarcerated for a term of 220 months and followed BOP\u2019s policies and practices, Reid had not been subjected to the deprivation in SHUs since his latest transfer.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Reid consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Arizona Department of Corrections, and the Arizona Office of Inspector General."
