  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Andrew Tran, a California resident who was sentenced to 40 years to life for second degree murder, attempted murder, and street terrorism.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, Tran was a member of a criminal street gang known as the \"Tiny Rascal Gang\" and was associated with several rival gangs. The complaint alleges that Tran and his brother, Jonathan Tieu, were members of the T&T gang, and Tran had ties to both the TRG and Hellside gangs. Tran allegedly engaged in a series of aggressive actions, including firing a gun at a rival gang member, causing the rival gang members to attack Tran\u2019s car. The SEC alleges that, in a parallel action, the California Attorney General announced criminal charges against Tran.  The SEC also announced that it was appointing a receiver for Tran to determine whether to impose a mandatory minimum sentence for each of the alleged crimes.  Tran consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, to the appointment of a receiver. The receiver will determine the receiver of the receiver upon motion of the court upon motion by the SEC.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued a temporary restraining order, temporarily enjoining Tran from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also issued an order suspending the receiver from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any security or other security order.  On March 20, 2011, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in the Southern District of New York charging Tran with violating Section 15 of the Exchange Act and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the San Diego Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Los Angeles Police Department, and the California State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
