  "summary": "On May 25, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan entered a final judgment against Scottsdale Insurance Co. of State of Michigan for failing to timely pay a penalty interest related to a fire insurance policy.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Michigan on May 24, 2013, Scottsdale Insurance Company (\"Scottsdale\"), a Michigan-based insurance company, issued a commercial fire policy to Palmer, Michigan, covering the property for fire and other specified losses from November 2011 through November 2012.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of the policy, Palmer was entitled to payment of the penalty interest under \u00a7500.2006(4) without being entitled to the right to assert defenses to coverage under the policy.\u00c2\u00a0 The complaint also alleges that the policy requires that a claim for penalty interest be filed within a specified period of time, even if the insured has not demanded that relief in its pleadings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of 12% per year compounded annually, for a total of $1,642,796.76. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Palmer arising from the same conduct alleged by the complaint.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Insurance, and the Michigan Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, the SEC\u00c2\u00a0recently issued an Investor Alert touting the safety and effectiveness of its policies, including the ability to detect and detect suspicious patterns of fraud and negligence, and recommended that investors check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website to identify whether their investments are subject to SEC disclosure requirements. Investors can\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of any investment that may have been made in a company"
