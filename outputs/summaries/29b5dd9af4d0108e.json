  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered final judgments against New Jersey Manufacturers Insurance Company (NJM) and its co-defendant, Surgicare Surgical Associates of Fair Lawn, Inc., in an action brought by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (DOI). The SEC's complaint alleges that, on January 1, 2015, the federal agency issued an order requiring NJM to reimburse ASCs for procedures not listed as reimbursable when performed at an ASC. According to the complaint, the order did not require that ASCs receive reimbursement for procedures performed under CPT codes, and instead required that the ASC receive reimbursement from NJM. The complaint further alleges that NJM failed to provide reasonable and reasonable reimbursement for certain procedures performed in an ASC, and failed to comply with the Department's policy. In addition, the complaint alleges NJM violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced criminal charges against NJM for its violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC also announced related administrative proceedings against the defendants.  In a related matter, a federal district court in New Jersey issued a final judgment on January 21, 2012, that permanently enjoins NJM from future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The court also granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze, a temporary restraining order, and an officer-and-director bar. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Office of Insurance Regulation."
