  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against a Mecklenburg County man who was convicted of five counts of sexual misconduct in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that Willie Hicks, Jr., a twenty-year-old pediatric nurse practitioner, was falsely told that a doctor had previously made false allegations of sexual abuse against Coleman. The complaint further alleges that, after the trial, the trial court found that the doctor had made false claims of abuse in the course of her examination of the victim, and that she had previously told the doctor that the same thing had happened to her. The court also ruled that, based on the evidence presented to the jury, the doctor could not determine whether Coleman had made prior false accusations of abuse.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hicks.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed on June 12, 2017, the jury found the appellant guilty of all five of the charges, including one count of rape. The jury found him guilty on all five counts, and he was sentenced to a mandatory term of life in prison and ordered to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  On June 23, 2018, the court granted the court's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, and ordered Hicks to surrender his passport.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hicks consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of $2,965, which is equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,500. The judgment also prohibits Hicks from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offer or solicitation of an offer to purchase or sell any security in the securities of any broker, dealer, municipal, or municipal securities dealer. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Hicks from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, David A. Kasper, and Amy S. Cotter of the Philadelphia Regional Office."
