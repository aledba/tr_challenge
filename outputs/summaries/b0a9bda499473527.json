  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a former high school football player who was convicted of two counts of sodomy in the first degree, and two of attempted first degree sodomy.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, on August 19, 2014, Maverick Holmsley, then a senior football player at Principia High School, entered the dorm rooms of six underclassmen in the middle of the night. The complaint alleges that the older players held each victim down and inserted or attempted to insert an object or finger into the younger boys' anuses through their clothing.  The complaint further alleges that, in closing argument, the defendant told the jury that he had deviated sexual intercourse for purposes of sexual gratification, and that he did not have to find sexual gratification to commit the offenses.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the jury was never instructed to disregard the defendant\u2019s statement that there was more to the definition of deviate sexual intercourse than provided in the jury instructions.  Instead, the complaint alleges, the trial court failed to give a curative instruction to the jury.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Tennessee today announced criminal charges against Holmsly.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of five years and a $10,000 civil penalty. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Jeffery A. Burns and supervised by Amy S. Cotter of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Burns. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Department of Justice."
