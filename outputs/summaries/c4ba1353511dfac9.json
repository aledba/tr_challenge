  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island today entered a final judgment against a Warwick, Rhode Island man for his role in a child pornography case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Warwick, R.I., alleges that Antonio Pina (Pina) and Kathryn Johnson (Kathryn) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that Pina and Kathryn were friends and shared a common interest in automobiles. According to the complaint, defendant admitted to downloading about a hundred videos of child pornography on his computer and then conducted a follow-up interview at the state police barracks. During the second interview, defendant allegedly admitted that he had watched videos of preteen girls having sex and that he \"viewed [child pornography] everyday.\" The complaint further alleges that defendant told his grandmother that he was attracted to a beautiful girl who he \"stared down\" as she was walking out of the courtroom. The defendant also allegedly told his mother that she had witnessed a \"look but don't touch\" video of a little girl performing a sexual act on the defendant. The SEC alleges that the defendant made these statements during the course of the child pornography investigation, and that defendant agreed to the entry of a curative instruction to preclude the use of such evidence in the future. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits defendants from making or selling any material, non-public information, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged conduct of a defendant.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Pina consented to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York today announced criminal charges against Pina. Pina pleaded guilty to one count of first-degree child molestation and was sentenced to four years in prison. The jury deliberated for two hours before finding Pina guilty of one count and ordering him to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Pina agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to a three-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting her from appearing, practicing, or practicing in the public or in the private capacity of a lawyer. She also agreed to be suspended from appearing and practicing"
