  "summary": "On January 16, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final default judgment against defendants for trademark counterfeiting and infringement, false designation of origin, and unfair competition.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, Florida, alleges that, since at least 2014, defendants have used the internet to promote, offer, and sell goods bearing their trademarks, including, among other things, the creation and sale of thousands of pairs of counterfeit jeans.  According to the complaint, the internet-based photo albums available through the internet were used by defendants to create the illusion that the goods were genuine and that they were made from genuine products.  In fact, the complaint alleges that defendants used the photo albums for the purpose of deriving the benefit of Plaintiff's reputation and the websites that market and sell the goods.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the federal registration provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $2,000,000.00, prejudgment interest of $1,500, and a civil penalty of $3,500.00.  Additionally, the court granted a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15b-5 thereunder, as well as an officer-and-director bar for the defendants.  On January 19, 2019 the court entered a default judgment ordering the defendants to comply with the court's order.   The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to proceed with the litigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Miami Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Patent and Trademark Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of State Office of Financial Regulation."
