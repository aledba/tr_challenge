  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in favor of a D.C.-based attorney who has agreed to pay $93,676.78 in fees and costs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  According to the court's order, filed on May 18, 2017, the court granted the attorney's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered her to pay a total of $75,286.78.  The court also granted the counsel's request for a preliminary injunction, which requires the court to determine the amount of attorneys' fees that should be awarded based on the prevailing market rate.  In a parallel action, on Jan. 12, 2018, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York announced that it would conduct a fee-shifting investigation into the practice of IDEA litigation, which is conducted by attorneys with similar skill, experience, and reputation as those of their clients. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges the attorney with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the attorney consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders her to disgorge $93.78, plus interest and a penalty equal to $62,821.63.  On Jan. 13, 2019, the Court granted the attorneys' motion for an injunction against further violations of the anti-fraud provisions, ordered the attorney to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, and issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an injunction.  A hearing is scheduled for Feb. 24, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1415 (D.C. 2016).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.N. Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
