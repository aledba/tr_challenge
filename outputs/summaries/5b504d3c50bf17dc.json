  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama today entered final judgments against the defendants in a case brought by Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania and the Alabama Department of Public Health.  According to the court's order, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.  In a separate case, the court also issued a temporary restraining order, temporarily freezing the defendants' assets, and temporarily barring them from participating in any future offering of pre-viability abortions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws, imposes a $1 million civil penalty, and requires them to provide abortions at or after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The court granted the defendants the right to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000 each.  On May 17, the U. S. District Judge in the MiddleDistrict of Alabama granted the Defendants' request for an injunction against further violations of the federal anti-fraud provisions, ordered the clinics to comply with the court order, and issued an order temporarily restraining the defendants from violating these provisions. The order also temporarily froze the clinics' assets and ordered them to pay an $80,000 civil penalty. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The Court appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Attorney General's Office Criminal Investigations, and the Federal Office of Health and Human Services in this matter."
