  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment against defendant Jayson L. Woods in a double jeopardy case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 29, 2016, Woods was convicted of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit robbery, and first degree murder in connection with an alleged two-way video game robbery.  The SEC alleges that Woods, along with three other men, engaged in a multi-pronged scheme to steal money from victims through online escort advertisements.  Woods allegedly used his cell phone to record conversations with victims while they waited for someone to respond to one of the advertisements online.  As alleged in the complaint, Woods then drove a group of men to a remote location to meet victims and demanded and/or kicked them out of the car.  On the night of the robbery, Woods allegedly told one victim that he would drive the group to the lake where he would take the money without performing any sexual acts.  He also allegedly instructed the victim to hide in the bushes in case Schneider needed help.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Woods arising from the same conduct alleged by the SEC in Craig, Idaho.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Woods consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71 plus prejudgment interest of $2,072.71, a civil penalty of $75,000, and a conduct-based injunction against further violations of Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  Additionally, Woods agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in violation of the federal securities laws, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  To settle the SEC case, Woods has agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations and to pay a $25,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000.71.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Idaho Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Idaho State Corporation Commission in this matter."
