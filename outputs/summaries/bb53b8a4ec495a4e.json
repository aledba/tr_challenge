  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of Miami Lodge #20, Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), which found that the City of Miami violated the antifraud provisions of Section 4(b)(2) of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, Larry Hagan was suspended for 120 hours without pay on November 12, 2013, for conduct that resulted in his 120-hour suspension. The complaint alleges that, when he elected to appeal his suspension to the Civil Service Board, the City Manager terminated Hagan without conducting a separate hearing, resulting in cumulative and successive punishments for the same conduct.  The complaint further alleges that the city manager's decision to terminate Hagan resulted in \"double jeopardy\" because he had already served the 120-day suspension and was unsupported by competent substantial evidence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hagan consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 447.401 and 547.6 of the governing Collective Bargaining Agreement, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Miami today announced criminal charges against Hagan.  On March 31, 2015, a federal judge in Miami issued a final order ordering the city to cease and desist from unilaterally refusing to process and arbitrate Hagan's civil service disciplinary action and to pay the FOP its reasonable attorney's fees and costs.  Hagan also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Miami Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Department of Public Safety, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Office of Inspector General in this matter."
