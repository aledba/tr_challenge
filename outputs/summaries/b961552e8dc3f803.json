  "summary": "On August 22, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment in favor of LeFande in a civil action brought by his estate against District Title, a real estate settlement company.  According to the court's order, filed on September 15, 2017, the court issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to appear before the court for a status conference on September 21, 2017.  The court also issued a criminal contempt order, requiring the defendant to show cause as to why he should not be held in contempt for violating the district court\u2019s order and requiring him to comply with the subpoena.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Lefande.  As alleged in the complaint, in 2014, Anita Warren sold a piece of real estate through District Title to her son, Timothy Day, and District Title sought to enforce its judgment by subpoenaing her for a hearing in which she would determine whether to issue a subpoena or otherwise impose a civil contempt order.  On September 16, the magistrate judge issued a contempt order against Leffande, ordering him to appear in court on the date ordered by the court and to answer questions about the nature of the transaction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $5,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that he will pay in the future.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Cooter & Gell, and the litigation will be led by John Rymas. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maryland Attorney General's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, as well as the Office of the Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also check the background of anyone selling investments with the SEC by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's Investor.gov website to quickly identify any red flags of suspicious activity."
