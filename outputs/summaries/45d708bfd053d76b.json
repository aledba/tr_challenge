  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Angelica Chavez, a San Diego, California resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, alleges that, in 1999, Chavez purchased residential real property in San Diego and refinanced the property in 2006.  According to the complaint, the property was sold at auction below fair market value and Chavez was forced to move from her home and suffered significant financial losses.  As alleged, the complaint further alleges that Chavez failed to adequately plead to the court that she qualified for a permanent loan modification because she did not have a contractual basis to exercise the power of sale.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Chavez.  To settle the SEC's charges, Chavez consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to pay $380,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of her ill-gotten gains.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Chavez agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and orders her to repay $1,167.46 in principal and interest, which is $10,603.65 in arrears, as of October 29, 2009, and by foreclosing on the property.  After the settlement was reached, the court found that Chavez was entitled to a permanent injunction against future violations and ordered her to return the property to the owner.  She agreed to a settlement where she would be permanently enjoined from violations of Section 5(b).  The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge William G. Sansone of the U. S. District court for the Northern District of Florida entered a judgment against the defendants, ordering them to disgorge $310,078 in illusory gains plus interest and penalties, and imposing a $20,000 civil penalty against each of them.   The court also issued an order requiring the defendants to provide a copy of the Judgment that permanently prohibits them from acting as a broker or dealer in"
