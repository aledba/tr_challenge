  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Safeway Insurance Company of Louisiana, a Louisiana-based insurance company, and its owner, Christopher Williams, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ruston, Louisiana, alleges that Williams and Safeway violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to pay Williams' property damage and loss of use claims to Safeway.  According to the complaint, Williams and Williams agreed to settle the defendants' claims without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Williams also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1,826. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 8, 2017, the trial court entered a judgment ordering Safeway to pay the total loss of the defendant's vehicle to the court.  In its order, the court found that the defendants had a reasonable discussion regarding the settlement in the form of a \"meeting of minds\" regarding the amount of the settlement and that Safeway's failure to tender the settlement to the plaintiff was a breach of the insurer's duties imposed in Subsection A of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that Williams, Safeway, and Williams violated the duty of good faith and fair dealing by not tendering the settlement amount to the defendant, despite repeated requests from the plaintiff's counsel, to do so.   The court's order also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amounts of their respective profits.  Additionally, the SEC's investigation was conducted by Bliss Fontenot, a claims adjuster at the time of the accident, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Ms. Shelton and Ms. Sansone. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
