  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Sharon B. Leners, a registered nurse, and her husband in a marital dissolution action. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in 2016, Sharon and Stacy Leners were married for nearly 12 years and shared legal and physical custody of two minor children. The complaint alleges that, from the outset of the divorce proceedings, Sharon told Stacy that she would receive a divorce spouse pension when she was the one who left, because he was going to have to \u201cpay for it.\u201d The complaint further alleges that Stacy told Sharon that he could not afford to pay the increased fee of $260 a month and that he would receive some of his pension after they were divorced. The SEC alleges that the court improperly awarded the parties joint custody of the children, and instead awarded them a share of the child's pension. As alleged in the complaint, the court misappropriated the child\u2019s mother-in-law and other family members\u2019 funds to pay for the divorce. The court also improperly awarded Sharon a portion of her pension in the form of a 401K and pension, which she claimed was in the best interests of her and her employer. In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for New York announced criminal charges against Stacy. The case was investigated by the Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Nebraska Division of Child and Family Education, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the State Department of Insurance, the Nebraska Office of Insurance Regulation, the Missouri Department of Banking and Securities, the Secretary of State's Office, the Division of Insurance Fraud Section, as well as the Nebraska Bureau of Insurance's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy.
