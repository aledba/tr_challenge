  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Frank Allan and Rosamaria Rees, a California-based life insurance company, for failing to pay the company's attorney fees and costs.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Frank, a registered representative of Farmers New World Life Insurance Company, filed an interpleader action on September 18, 2009, alleging that, based on his status as a \"big gambler\" and having a couple million dollars in life insurance policy benefits, he was entitled to the funds even though he had not received any adverse claims.  The complaint further alleges that, during the course of the litigation, Frank submitted a second amended cross-complaint asserting that the funds were not in dispute and that the company had not yet paid him the policy benefits.  Frank's amended complaint, which was unsealed today, charges Farmers with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Frank consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $154,587 (plus any accrued interest) and $7,997.49, respectively, in the amount of $150,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Frank. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Fraud Task Force. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Frank and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
