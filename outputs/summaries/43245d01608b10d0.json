  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Moufid Makhraz, a Stamford, Connecticut man accused of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on December 7, 2011, the defendants entered into a month-to-month lease for the purpose of renting 46-50 Magee Avenue in Stamford. The complaint alleges that the defendants breached the lease agreement by failing to pay the full amount of rent and late fees and by damaging the premises and failing to reimburse the plaintiff for the damage and cost of collection.  The complaint further alleges that, when the defendants filed their motion for summary judgment, the court improperly permitted and considered the defendant's live testimony during the hearing on the motion, allowing the defendant to amend his motion to include judgment on all counts when the written motion only sought relief from the two counts of breach of contract.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $3500, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000, and requires him to repay the amount of his ill-gotten gains with interest.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against Makhzraz.
