  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of committing a felony in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbia, Connecticut, alleges that Joseph Moore entered the New Alliance Bank in Columbia on July 13, 2009, wearing a white tank top and dark sweatpants and carrying a gun. According to the complaint, Ovian advised the petitioner to accept each of the plea offers offered to him, informing the petitioner that the maximum sentence he could face would be \"at least as severe\" or exceed the sentence he faced if he was successful in proving at trial that he only had committed robbery in the third degree. The complaint further alleges that Ovian failed to inform the petitioner of the potential total sentence exposure he faced should he choose to proceed to trial. The SEC alleges that the petitioner's failure to inform his trial counsel of this fact constituted a violation of his right to adequate and effective assistance of counsel.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against Moore.  On January 17, 2017, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Ovian and ordered him to surrender his passport. The court also issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of forty-eight and one-half years, for a total of thirty-four years incarceration.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Moore consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge $35,000 in ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar. The order also prohibits Ovian from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of securities, and prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. In addition, the order requires Ovian to provide an independent examination of the facts of the case and to advise the client on the appropriate course of action given the overwhelming evidence presented by the trial counsel. In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted an asset freeze against Moore, which was followed by a hearing on January 24, 2017. The hearing was conducted in the absence of a hearing officer. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigation."
