  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 115 months of imprisonment with four years of supervised release.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, N.Y. on May 29, 2018, alleges that former Cattaraugus County Jail inmate Giovanni Cotto violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1513 of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Cotto consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Cotto also agreed to be barred from participating in the prosecution of a federal criminal case.  In its judgment, the court held that Cotto was not required to show that he knew of the nature of the proceeding, that he had cooperated with law enforcement, and that he was not liable for the imposition of a penalty for the same conduct.  Instead, the judgment imposed a three-level enhancement for Cotto, requiring him to provide proof of his knowledge of federal jurisdiction, and imposing a five-year bar on him.  As set forth in the SEC's Complaint, the Court found that, based on Cotto\u2019s prior criminal conviction, he was liable for a five year prison sentence.  Without admitting to the SEC\u2019S findings, the defendant agreed to a five month prison sentence and to a six-year officer-and-director bar, and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  He also agreed not to participate in the issuance of a subpoena for a federal court hearing.  On May 30, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the United States District Court in Buffalo entered a judgment against Cotto that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of Sections 1513, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $5,000, which will be offset by a civil penalty of $50,000 and a $100,000 penalty in the parallel criminal case against Maldonado.   The court also granted Cotto a temporary restraining order and ordered him to comply with the court order. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Buffalo Police Department, and the Buffalo Regional Office in this matter.
