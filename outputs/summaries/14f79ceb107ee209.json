  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a judgment against the father and mother of a 2-year-old child who were found to have abandoned the child.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 31, 2018, the court found that the father had failed to provide for the material needs of the child and had abandoned her to the care of the Department of Human Resources.  The court also found that, contrary to the court's finding, the father did not have a residual right to visitation with the child when he was removed from the custody of the mother and the mother for possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, despite repeated attempts to convince the court to terminate the father's parental rights to the child, he had not provided any support for the child or been in contact with the department after his incarceration.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On March 22, 2019, the final judgment entered by the court permanently enjoins the defendants from violating these provisions, and orders them to comply with the court order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Health and Human Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to identify whether they are registered professionals."
