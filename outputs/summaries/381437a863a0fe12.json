  "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has obtained a final judgment against Diamond S Inc., a Montana-based real estate company, for failing to prosecute a fire-related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana, alleges that, in 2008, ECI purchased real property from Diamond S, which included several older commercial buildings, including one known as the Watercraft building. In 2008, the District Court granted ECI a partial summary judgment in its favor against Diamond, finding that the defendants had failed to adequately prosecute the claims. The court also found that ECI failed to timely respond to a request for a temporary restraining order or an asset freeze. The SEC alleges that in 2014, the district court granted a partial judgment in favor of ECI, granting the defendants partial relief, and denying ECI\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction.  In a parallel action, on February 22, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Banta of the United States District Court in Missoula County, Montana, granted partial summary judgments against Diamond. The District Court ruled that the delay was unreasonable, and ordered ECI to file a brief in opposition to the motion for relief. ECI agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. The case is being handled by Scott A. Birkenheier of the SEC Enforcement Division's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Daniel A. Kasper and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Mississippi Department of Insurance."
