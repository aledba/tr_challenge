  "summary": "On May 2, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of South Carolina entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of a bankrupt company that had been adjudged a bankrupt.  The court granted the estate's request for an attorney's fee enhancement, which is subject to court approval.  According to the court's order, on July 17, 1928, White Oak Lumber Company, Inc. (\"White Oak\") filed an involuntary Chapter 7 petition in the United States District Court in Charleston, South Carolina to have Yellow Poplar Lumber Co., Inc. (\u201cYellow Poplar\u201d) adjudged as a bankrupt and closed the case for administration. The court found that the common fund doctrine applies in bankruptcy cases, and that it is within the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court to award attorney's fees to the estate, not from the estate.  In addition, the court granted a fee enhancement for counsel who represented a debtor in obtaining a pre-petition settlement.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, the estate consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins White Oak from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the estate to pay $164,164.90 in fees to counsel who represents a creditor in a bankruptcy proceeding.  On May 4, 2018, the Court granted the Estate's motion for an emergency relief, including a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver for the estate and appointing an attorney.    The Court's order also prohibits the estate from seeking a penny-per-share in the amount of $100,000, and prohibits the payment of any additional fee to a trustee or trustee in bankruptcy proceedings. \u00c2\u00a0The court's decision also prohibits defendants from acting as unregistered broker-dealers and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with an offering of a penny stock, without requiring the trustee to pay a penny per share in a civil proceeding, and without requiring a penny share in the value of the trustee's estate.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, on May 9, 2018 the U-S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania announced criminal charges against White Oak.  This case is the latest in a series of cases where the court has issued an order requiring defendants to submit a memorandum to the SEC certifying their receipt of funds from assets of a bankruptcy estate. The SEC's complaint charges White Oak with violating the \"common fund\" provision of the federal securities laws and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  White Oak has agreed"
