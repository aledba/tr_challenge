  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a convicted felon for his role in a carjacking that resulted in the death of a police officer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that on June 18, 2011, Carmelo E. Vel\u00e1zquez-Aponte entered a guilty plea in a parallel criminal case and was sentenced to 12 months in prison.  According to the complaint, while in federal custody, he was charged with a series of carjackings, including one in which he injured an officer and another in a separate case. The complaint alleges that, while under the control of the federal marshals, Vel\u00e1quez took control of an SUV and drove it into a residential area where he injured another officer and stole his car. The SEC alleges that the defendant was at the center of the scheme, with the assistance of an FBI forensic scientist, when he was confronted by a man with a gun and demanded to know why he was not taking his medication. The defendant allegedly replied, \"I don't know what to say. I'm just trying to figure out what to do.\"  The complaint further alleges that he was in possession of a gun when he took the SUV, and that he used it to commit the other two carjacks.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Vel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guilty plea. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered Vel\u00e1za to surrender his passport, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment also orders Vel\u00e1Zquez to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $5,000 and $100,000, respectively.  On August 2, 2018, the court granted Vel\u00e1rez's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering him to comply with the court's order, and ordering the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order, ordering the payment of a $50,000 civil penalty, ordering Vel\u00e1ezquez to disgorge all of his ill-effects, and imposing a $75,000 penalty.
