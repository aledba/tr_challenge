  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a licensed general appraiser for his alleged failure to comply with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices (USPAP).  The SEC's complaint against Teddy Reynolds alleges that he failed to adequately develop a \"Highest and Best Use\" analysis of land owned by Michael Worley because it was contemplating extending credit to Worley.  According to the complaint, Reynolds prepared a summary appraisal for Louisiana Land Bank in January 2010 that included a workfile, which contained several pages of Excel documents.  The complaint alleges that Reynolds did not analyze the prior transfers of the subject property within the past 36 months and failed to include support or explanation in the workfile as to the reasons why he could not have remedied the deficiencies in his appraisal.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Reynolds consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  In its order, the court also ordered Reynolds to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Diana Piechocki, and the litigation will be led by John Rymas. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the United States Postal Inspection Service."
