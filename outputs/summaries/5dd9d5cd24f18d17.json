  "summary": "On June 14, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Colorado entered a final judgment in favor of Boulder City Councilors v. City of Boulder and several of its officials, finding that they violated the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, on May 15, 2018 the City Council unanimously passed Ordinance 8245 (\u201cthe ordinance\u201d) that amended the Boulder Revised Code to prohibit the sale or possession of \"assault weapons\u201d and large-capacity ammunition magazines within the city of Boulder. The ordinance also raised the legal age for possession of firearms from eighteen to twenty-one.  The complaint alleges that the city's ordinance violated the antifraud provisions of the state securities laws, and that the district court improperly abstained.  In its judgment, the court held that the ordinance was unconstitutionally applied and that it should not be preempted by state law.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the city and its officials consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the securities laws and order them to comply with the court's order.  On June 16, 2019, the Court of Appeals for the District of Denver issued an order requiring the city to abstain from the issuance of any final judgment that would impose permanent injunctions, impose a civil penalty, and impose an officer-and-director bar on the city. The court also issued a temporary restraining order preventing the city from issuing or selling any security or other security measure to the public.  A federal district court previously ruled that the Colorado state laws preempted a federal home rule ordinance.  As a result of the Court's order, the Colorado statutes preempted the federal state law preempted, and the federal statutes are pre-empted by the state laws. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the City of Denver. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Caldera and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Babbitt. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Denver Police Department, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and Colorado Attorney General's Office in this matter."
