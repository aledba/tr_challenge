  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Miami-area woman who was convicted of aggravated identity theft for her role in a series of car burglaries.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that on January 7, 2015, the Miami Regional Office obtained a search warrant for the home of a family member who had been targeted by the burglars. The complaint alleges that Ms. Maitre hid her illegal activity from her husband, Willie Smith, her boyfriend, Daryl Pugh, and two others, and that she never asked her husband about the items in the house. Instead, the complaint alleges, the officers found numerous items that were in plain view and in places where she would see them, including purses, wallets, debit cards, credit cards, and a shoebox with car keys. According to the complaint, Smith and Pugh then stole purses and other personal items from the house, including a pair of Rolex watches. The SEC also alleges that the defendants hid their illegal activities from her, including putting items in her underwear drawer, and putting the stolen property in the dumpster. The court also found that the officers were not trained in the use of the technology, and the evidence presented by the officers was not consistent with the evidence. The case was investigated by the Office of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Florida, the Division of Criminal Investigations, and an Office of Inspector General. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry."
