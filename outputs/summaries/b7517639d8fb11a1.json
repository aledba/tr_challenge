  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Raul Alberto Rengifo-Mendoza, Williams Alfredo Perea-Blandon, and Isaias Garcia-Garcia in a parallel criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that, in April 2017, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the District of Miami unsealed criminal charges against Rengiefo and Ortega-Montez, charging them with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the defendants conspired to possess with intent to distribute cocaine while aboard a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and that they used the vessel to carry the drug.  According to the complaint, the defendants were going to refuel and transfer the drug to another boat at a specific location before they could meet up with the boat coming from Mexico.  In addition, the complaint alleges that one of the defendants made an unregistered offer of the drug and the other defendant made an offer to sell the drug in exchange for a share of the proceeds of the sale.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and require the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000. The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Robert A. Currid granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered them to surrender their passports, and ordered the destruction of any evidence that may have been collected in the case. The SEC\u2019s investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John R. Rymas and Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The Commission on International Affairs has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy in this matter."
