  "summary": "On June 13, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against the California Department of Transportation and its related entities for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1260.040 of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, California, the Caltrans and Caltrans Agencies agreed to settle a civil injunctive action by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions.  The court also granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an expedited hearing to determine liability in inverse condemnation cases.  In a parallel action, the California Attorney General announced criminal charges against the Agencies for their role in this matter.  As alleged in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants failed to adequately disclose to the court that the CalTrans and CalTrans Agencies had violated the federal and state securities laws by failing to adequately consider the merits of the defendants\u2019 claims.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the Defendants consented to the issuance of the final judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from violating the federal, state, and local securities laws, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against each of them.  Finally, the court granted the defendants the right to a preliminary injunction, which requires the parties to show cause and effect of any action, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000 or more.  On June 19, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Los Angeles County District Court granted the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment against them, agreeing to a permanent injunction, and appointing a receiver to determine the amount and severity of their civil injunctions.  At the same time, the Commission issued an order suspending the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any penny stock that may be offered to the public in connection with the settlement of the inverse condemnation action.  A hearing on June 20, 2019 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.  Separately, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the California Office of Financial Regulation issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
