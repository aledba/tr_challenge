  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against the Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS) in favor of the agency.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Minneapolis, alleges that the DHS violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, DHS failed to determine whether a child with special needs was eligible for adoption assistance under federal law.  In a parallel action, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it would not reimburse Minnesota for its failure to adopt J.E.S., an Eastern European child with Down syndrome.  DHS previously denied the agency\u2019s request for an emergency court order to expedite an application for federal adoption assistance.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Minnesota agency consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal and state laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the court granted the agency and DHS a temporary restraining order against further violations of the anti-fraud provisions, including Section 17(a)(1) of The Securities Act of 1933, and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and ordered the agency to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the court.  On August 17, 2016, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued an order requiring Minnesota to participate in the adoption assistance program. The order also requires the state to develop a plan to place the child with appropriate adoptive parents, which is consistent with the federal law, and requires the federal government to approve the placement of the child. The court also ordered DHS to provide an accounting of the number of adoptions that were deemed eligible for assistance under the federal program.  As part of the settlement, DIS agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of these provisions. The SEC also agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 18, 2003).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Minnesota Office of Advocacy and Education. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by C.B."
