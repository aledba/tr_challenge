According to the SEC's complaint, filed on June 16, 2017, Shawn Michael Martin of Charlotte, North Carolina, and his wife, Erin Lynn Martin, were the parents of two minor children. The complaint alleges that Defendant-Husband, who lives in Charlotte, engaged in aggressive driving while the children were in the car, and that after he locked the door, he repeatedly pounded on the door and broke into the children's bedroom, causing her fear of physical assault.

Martin also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Margaret P. Eagel of the U. S. District court in Charlotte entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant, freezing his assets, and ordering him to return to his home state.  To settle the case, the court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the anti-harassment provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and the broker-dealer bar against"
