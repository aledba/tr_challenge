  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against a Utah woman who filed for divorce from her husband in 2005.  The court found that, contrary to the court's findings, the defendant had failed to demonstrate any substantial change in the circumstances underlying the original decree.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, Annaleise T. Peeples (Mother) sought and obtained a temporary custody order to give her sole custody of her two young daughters, Adam and Evelyn T. (Evelyn T.).  The complaint alleges that, in 2004, the court entered a bifurcated decree of divorce, severing the parties' marital union but reserving all other issues, including custody and parent-time, for further proceedings.  As alleged in the complaint, however, that the court did not consider the material and material change in circumstances when it entered the final decree, and instead relied on the opinion of a custody evaluator.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Utah today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000, $20,000 in disgorgement, and $1,500 in prejudgment interest, and requires the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Department of Justice and the Utah Office of Family Education and Advocacy."
