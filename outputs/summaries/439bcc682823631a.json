  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a California-based company and its owner for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on June 29, 2012, filed by a Valencia, California resident who claimed that she was disabled and requested an extension of her tenancy in exchange for monthly rental payments, the complaint alleges that Westfield violated Section 13(a)(1) and 13(b)(3) of that federal securities law, and that the complaint was based on the filing and service of an unlawful detainer complaint and did not arise from protected activity under the federal securities laws.  The complaint also alleges that the defendants failed to adequately disclose to the tenants that they were not subject to a 60-day notice of termination and that they failed to pay relocation fees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Westfield consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(d) of those securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of $14,911.50, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $15,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Westfield. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the California Department of Insurance, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
