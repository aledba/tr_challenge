The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that two companies, Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Fortino Worldwide, Inc., violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the companies violated Section 5(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and that they violated the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants violated the anti-fraud provision of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206 of 1940.

Additionally, the court has agreed to a permanent injunction against the defendants from violating the provisions of Sections 5(b) and 5(c) and to the issuance of any stock in the future.
