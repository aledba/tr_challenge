  "summary": "On May 16, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered final judgments against Florida Power & Light Co. and Sierra Club in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that, in March 2016, the Commission issued a final order ordering Florida Power&Light to comply with its public interest standard for reviewing settlement agreements.  According to the Commission's order, the settlement agreement provided for a base rate increase of $400 million and a limited-scope adjustment of $200 million.  As alleged in the complaint, these increases were unreasonable, unnecessary, and more expensive than the Commission had previously recommended.  In addition, the order required that the Commission consider whether the settlement was in the public interest, whether it was reasonable and fair, and whether it had the requisite prudence to make such a determination.  Additionally, the final order required the Commission to determine whether the settlements constituted a \"public interest\" standard.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's final order, Florida Power and Light agreed to settle the case without admitting or denied the Commission findings. The settlement agreement also provided for the issuance of a final judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.  Sierra Club also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $250,000 and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Miami Regional Office by Scott A. Mascianica, John Rymas, and Eric R. Werner of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Regulatory Affairs, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Insurance."
