  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Jon Wilmot, a former fireman who was convicted of stealing from the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CERL).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, alleges that Wilmot violated Section 7522.72 of the Pension Reform Act of 2013.  According to the complaint, on January 1, 2013, Wilmot submitted his application for retirement to the CERL Board of Retirement, which determined that he was entitled to a pension when he was already formally retired.  The complaint further alleges that, by virtue of his conviction, he was not a \"public employee\" or \"member\" when he submitted his retirement application.  Wilmot also alleges that he did not have a \"prior service pension\" as of the date he submitted that application, because he had retired effective the preceding December 13, 2012.  In addition, the complaint alleges that as a result of Wilmot\u2019s alleged misconduct, his pension benefits were forfeited, and he was subject to a forfeiture provision that would reduce his monthly check from $8,758.61 to $2,858.56.

It also ordered WilMot to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and Wilmot agreed to pay civil penalties of $250,000.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Charles Treat of the San Francisco District Court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Wilmot of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(d) and (e) of Exchange Act Section 10-b) and Rules 15d-1 and (4) thereunder and orders him to disgorge $150,000 in ill"
