  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against defendant Filiberto Espinoza, who was convicted of aiding and abetting a Kansas City, Kansas man's attempted aggravated robbery and attempted first-degree murder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City on November 27, 2016, Gonzalez was charged with two counts of felony murder and one count of attempted first degree murder. The complaint alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, Gonzalez used a series of false and misleading statements to convince a jury that he was capable of finding a defendant guilty of a felony murder, attempted second-degree felony, and conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery.  The complaint further alleges that the jury deliberated for less than an hour before finding Gonzalez guilty of those counts without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  In its judgment, the court found that Gonzalez violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Gonzalez agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, other than for his own personal use, and from participating as an officer or director of a public company. The judgment also prohibits him from associating with any person with a history of felony or related criminal conduct, including his prior convictions for securities fraud, securities law violations, and securities laws violations. The SEC's order also prohibits Gonzalez from participating with any other person in a scheme to commit a felony or to assist in a related criminal action, and orders him to comply with the court's order barring him from serving as a judge or jury. The court also ordered Gonzalez to cooperate with the FBI in its investigation of the matter.  On December 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered a judgment against Gonzalez, finding him liable for a total of 17 felony counts, including one that he has already pled guilty to, and ordering him to be enjoined from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act. The judge granted the request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) and 207(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The order also requires Gonzalez to pay disgorgement of $1,078,"
