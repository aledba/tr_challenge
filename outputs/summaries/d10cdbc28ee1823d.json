  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of three counts of criminal misconduct in connection with the alleged sexual assault of his daughter.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that Elmer G. of Connecticut violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendant told the victim that he had \"knowledge of the terms of the order\" and that he was not permitted to have contact with the victim outside of court-approved visits.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant asked the victim's sister to deliver the letter to the victim, rather than delivering it himself.  As alleged, the sister consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Without admitting to the SEC's allegations, Elmer agreed to the judgment that he would not violate the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and that the court would determine whether to impose a permanent injunction, impose a conduct-based injunction, or otherwise impose a civil penalty.  Elmer also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, other than for the purpose of obtaining a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged securities laws and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his legal fees.  Separately, the SEC announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against the defendant, charging him with violating Section 15(a) of The Exchange Act and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and ordering him to disgorge $1,038,865, which he agreed to pay in a civil monetary penalty of $100,000.  It also charged the defendant with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 53a-223b (a) and (c), the defendant violated Section 5(b)(2)(A) of Securities Act and Section 13(d) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13d-3 thereunder and that, as a result of the defendant's violations of Section 15a-3 of the Exchange Act, he was prohibited from representing himself as a lawyer or practicing as a public"
