  "summary": "On October 5, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the trust against Thomas Gosdeck, a former officer of Program Risk Management, Inc., who served as counsel to the trust.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albany, New York, Gosdeck was counsel to a trust that was underfunded and required the execution of a number of consent agreements intended to preserve it.  The complaint alleges that Gosdeck recommended and prepared agreements that materially overstated the trust's obligations under their agreements with the trust, and failed to perform management functions and accepting of fees in violation of those agreements.  As alleged in the complaint, in 2010, when efforts to reduce this deficit failed, the trustees voted to stop providing workers' compensation.  In 2011, after consulting the trust with Gosdeck about the issues raised by the SEC, the trust terminated its contract with Program Risk, which included the provision that the trust had \"demonstrated an inability to properly administer its liabilities.\"  In 2012, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Gosdeck for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John M. Conroy, Antonia Lasicki, John Lessard, Thomas McKeown, Vincent Sirangelo, Phillip Saperia, Steven Greenfield, Peter Pierri, Fred Apers, Peter Campanelli and Diana Antos\u2013Arens of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John Birkenheier. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission."
