  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Orleans today entered a final judgment against Thayon Samson, a twenty-two-year veteran of the New Orleans Police Department, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, from approximately 4:45 a.m. on June 21, 2015 through July 4, 2015, defendant Thayaon Samson was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, second- degree kidnapping, and obstruction of justice.  According to the complaint, the jury deliberated for nearly an hour before finding that Thayons was guilty of the charges and that he was liable for a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  In a parallel action, on July 5, 2019, the Honorable Judge Robert Barrere granted the SEC's request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, ordering that the SEC obtain a court order freezing the assets of both defendants and ordering the asset freeze to be temporarily halted pending final approval of the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil monetary penalty, and a bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On July 6, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Samson, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and an officer and director bar against Samson.  Among other things, the court ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of the evidence in the case, which was conducted by staff in the Division of Criminal Investigations, including the Chief of the Division's Analysis and Detection Center, John Rymas, with the assistance of the Office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana and the Department of Justice Criminal Division's Office of Public Safety Cyber Unit.  A hearing will be conducted on July 24, 2020.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221, July 17, 2016.  Separately, the Court issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, ordering the receiver to record the receiver's communications with the receiver and to provide an accounting of any communications that may have been intercepted during the course of the investigation."
