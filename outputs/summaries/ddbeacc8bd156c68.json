  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against V'Nell L. Miskell, a Mississippi resident who was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced as a habitual offender to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole or early release.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, alleges that Miskell was falsely told by a trial judge that he had a right to a fair and impartial jury when, in fact, he had not.  According to the complaint, Miskell's brother and brother-in-law, Vernell Miskell and his brother, Pedro Alvarez, agreed to settle the case by agreeing to a judgment that permanently enjoins Miskell from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Miskell to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Miskell also agreed to be barred from appearing before the SEC as an attorney based on his conviction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Miskell arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of $50,000 and $100,000, respectively.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Mississippi Department of Justice."
