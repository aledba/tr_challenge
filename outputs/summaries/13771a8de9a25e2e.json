  "summary": "On July 1, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Merck Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Merck\"), a pharmaceutical company that manufactures and sells incretin-based drugs.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Merck violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to Merck's claims, the SEC failed to determine whether there was a causal relationship between the use of Januvia and pancreatic cancer. In addition, the complaint alleges that the FDA failed to adequately evaluate the safety of the drug and failed to inform Merck that it had failed to add a warning to the drug's label.  According to the complaint, Merck failed to consider the evidence presented in the SEC's investigation, which was conducted by a member of the FDA's Food and Drug Abuse Task Force and supervised by a federal district judge in Chicago.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced that it would conduct a parallel criminal investigation of the same matter. The SEC also issued an order requiring Merck to submit a written opinion to the court on whether it had sufficient evidence to justify an action to remove the drug from the market.  On July 2, 2018, the court issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of Merck, and ordering the company to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million. The court's order, which is subject to court approval, reserves the issue of whether a jury should determine whether a defendant is entitled to a judgment based on the facts presented by the court. The order also prohibits Merck from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any medical device without a court-ordered injunction, and prohibits the purchase, sale, or promotion of any such device.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the federal district court, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and orders Merck and Merck Inc. to pay civil penalties of $2 million each. The settlement is pending final approval by the SEC.  Merck has agreed to a settlement where it will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, and the court will determine whether it is appropriate to impose a bar"
