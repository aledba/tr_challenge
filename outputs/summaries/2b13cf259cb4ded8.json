  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against the defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, alleges that the defendants willfully failed to accurately apply Debtor's payments to her loan account.  According to the complaint, Debtor alleges that, before and after the filing of the motion for relief, the defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the payment history records of her loan.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Debtor allegedly communicated with her creditor multiple times where she expressed concerns regarding the accuracy of her payment history.  Debtor also allegedly filed and pursued a motion to dismiss under \u00a71327(a) under the SEC's confirmed Chapter 13 Plan, which requires a court to determine whether a debtor's entitlement to relief is reasonable.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 13 of the Exchange Act, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On July 26, 2018, the court granted a temporary restraining order against the Defendants from violating the agreed-upon settlement provisions of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(G) and 13(c) of Exchange Act Rule 12b-20, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  A hearing on the proposed settlement has been scheduled for August 21, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-189 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. Nov. 21, 2017).
