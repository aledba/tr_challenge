  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against Darnell Cleveland, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for two felony counts of possession of a gun without a license and one count of felony possession of marijuana.  According to the court's order, on November 24, 2017, Cleveland, a resident of Indianapolis, Indiana, was stopped by Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officers in a Walgreens parking lot. The officers conducted a search of the vehicle and found a handgun and two individual baggies containing marijuana. The court found that the officers had the authority to search the vehicle without obtaining a finding of ability to pay the $50 public defender's fee, which is required by the federal and state constitutions.  The court also ruled that the search was lawful and that there was no error regarding the purpose of the search.  In its judgment, the court held that Cleveland violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court should have excluded all evidence obtained from the search and arrest because it lacked probable cause to determine whether Cleveland was indigent.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, Cleveland consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal, state, and federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $50,000 civil penalty. The judgment also prohibits Cleveland from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in a public place, and bars him from participating as an officer or director of a public company. The Court also ordered Cleveland to pay $75,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his prison sentence.  On November 27, 2018, the Court granted the request for a temporary restraining order against Cleveland and ordered him to return to the vehicle with a gold bag. The order also prohibits the officers from conducting a warrantless search without first conducting an indigency hearing and without making a finding on whether Cleveland had been convicted of a felony. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Cleveland. The SEC's complaint charges Cleveland with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-director and penny stock bars against him. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Indianapolis Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson."
