  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against a former TSA agent who claimed that he or she performed administrative searches in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, TSA screeners are not law enforcement officers and do not perform searches for violations of federal law. Rather, the complaint alleges that TSA screeners conduct administrative searches that are not subject to the law enforcement proviso. The complaint further alleges that, in 2008, the SEC issued an order requiring the TSA to identify certain individuals who were subject to an administrative search, and that the agency failed to do so.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against one of the screeners. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against another individual for violating the same federal securities law.  On March 16, 2009, the U. S. District Judge in Philadelphia granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against the individual, and ordered the agency to pay a civil penalty of $951,200.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,078, which is equal to the civil penalties he will pay in the future.  Separately, a federal district court in New Jersey entered a judgment ordering the SEC to pay civil penalties of $2.5 million, $1 million, and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar. The court also ordered the company to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  An SEC investigation was conducted by John R. Kelly and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Kelly. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
