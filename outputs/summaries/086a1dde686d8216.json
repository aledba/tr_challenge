  "summary": "On November 15, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia entered a final judgment against Allied Title Lending, LLC d/b/a Allied Cash Advance, a Delaware limited liability company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, on July 25, 2016, the Debtor filed an amended complaint with the SEC alleging that Allied extended loans to debtors that violated Virginia's consumer finance laws and filed proofs of claim in bankruptcy proceedings based on those loans.  The SEC alleges that the amended complaint alleges that Allied violated Section 6.2-1541 of the Bankruptcy Code and that it was void and unenforceable.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York today announced criminal charges against Allied for the same conduct alleged in the SEC's complaint.  On November 16, 2017, the Court issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent examination of all of the claims in its complaint against Allied, which was filed in federal district court in Alexandria, Virginia.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the SEC from future violations of Section 5 of the federal securities laws and orders the court to determine whether to impose a civil penalty, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The court also granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia Attorney General's Office of Financial Regulation, and the Virginia Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
