  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Aaron S. A. that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, alleges that A.A., then 17 years old, was detained from his mother by the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) in December 2007, when he was 11 years old.  According to the complaint, the court terminated its dependency jurisdiction over him and ordered him to be placed in long-term foster care.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General (OIG) today announced that it has issued an order requiring the court to determine whether to suspend dependency jurisdiction or provide additional assistance in the case of a nonminor dependent.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order, A.a. has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal dependency jurisdiction, ordering him to comply with the court's orders, and requiring him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $50,000 civil penalty.  On January 26, 2015, the California District Court entered an order that permanently restrains the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and orders him to participate in a \"transitional independent living case plan.\"  The court's order also ordered A.B. to sign a written 90-day transition plan prepared pursuant to section 672(c).  The complaint further alleges that the court failed to consider the merits of the case when it issued its order.  Finally, the complaint alleges that, in an emergency, DCFS failed to provide timely and appropriate assistance in accessing a transitional independent living program.  As a result of the administrative actions of the court, the defendant was placed in a new foster placement under dual supervision by the probation department, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Juvenile Justice (DOJ), and the probation Department.  A. B. was placed with his paternal grandmother in May 2013, his 12th placement since 2007.  After his release from the DOJ, he sought to return to California to live with his mother and his father, but was denied the opportunity to do so because of his commitment to the DJJ, and the DOJ failed to make orders maintaining \u201cgeneral jurisdiction.\u201d  The case was investigated by the Arizona Office of Child Advocacy, which issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment"
