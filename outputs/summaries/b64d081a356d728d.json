  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of the National Association of the Deaf, a nonprofit organization that seeks to protect the rights of deaf and hard of hearing members of the public.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that the Florida Department of Education and the Florida State University Board of Trustees violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the federal securities laws by failing to provide captioning for live and archived videos of Florida legislative proceedings.  According to the complaint, these videos show the Florida Senate and House of Representatives receiving information and statements from the public, debating, negotiating, and voting on a host of issues.  Without providing captioning, the complaint alleges, the Florida House and Senate could not participate in the democratic process because they do not receive federal funding.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  To learn more about the SEC's investigation, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily identify whether they are eligible to apply for investor funds by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether their funds are being used for specific purposes.\u00c2\u00a0In addition,\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's Complaint alleges that, in 2017, the District Court issued an order granting the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordering the SEC to conduct an accounting of the funds it has received from the Department of Justice.   In its order, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction and ordered the defendants to respond to the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint.gov website.  It also issued an Order suspending the SEC from issuing any\u00c2\u00a0statements or orders relating to the subject matter of the complaint.  For further information, see SEC v. Gibson, No. 10-cr-101 (1911), No. 13-2071 (1913), No-1-1 (1914) and No. 12-2021 (1915).  The complaint also seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Finally, the SEC acknowledges the assistance of the FBI in this matter."
