  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the American Board of Radiology (ABR) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that ABR violated the anti-dumping provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0Antitrust Act of 1940.  ABR has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the SEC's order, ABR failed to comply with ABR's obligations under Section 5 of the Sherman Act, and ABR is liable for violations of Section 9 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's judgment, the ABR consented to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering ABR to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, and ordering ABRs to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced criminal charges against a former employee of ABR.   The case is being handled by Scott A. Mascianica, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
