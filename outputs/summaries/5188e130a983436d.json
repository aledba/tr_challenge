  "summary": "On May 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against the City of Chicago in a civil injunctive action brought by the Chicago Regional Office against the city.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that from 1989 to 2008, the city of Chicago and its then conservator, Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Fannie Mae), violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to exhaust all of the administrative remedies required by the federal government, including the right to reapply as conservators and to pay the transfer tax.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the city did not have the authority to determine whether the enterprises were governmental entities when it was not required to do so.  As a result of the court's order, the SEC is prohibited from issuing or selling any securities in violation of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Chicago Municipal Code \u00a7 3-33-060(B).  The complaint also alleges that, in a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Trilisky.  On May 9, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered the city to comply with the court order.  A hearing on May 10, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  To learn more about the Chicago municipal code, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 24, 2019).  In a related matter, on May 16, 2017, a federal district court in Illinois issued an order granting the city's request for an emergency asset freeze, freezing the assets of the entities, and imposing a civil penalty of $3.75 per square foot for each of the enterprises that were not deemed to be governmental entities by the court at the time of the action, and ordering the payment of the civil penalty, the auditor to provide an accounting of the assets that were lost in the action.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation of the matter was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Office of Public Finance.   The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. B. Braunstein."
