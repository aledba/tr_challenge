  "summary": "On July 1, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against the defendants in a medical negligence action brought by the estate of John Kujawa, who died in December 2012.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also ordered the defendants to pay $675,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the court's order, the defendants failed to meet their burden in agreeing to transfer the case to Effingham County, the county where the decedent died, for the purpose of recovering his injuries.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against two of the defendants. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison County, Illinois, charges the defendants with violations of the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws and seeks injunctive relief, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions and orders them to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval. The defendants have also agreed to be permanently enjoined from further violations of Sections 5(a)(2) and 5(c) thereunder of the Exchange Act and Rules 5a-5 and 5c-8 thereunder, and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future. The settlements are subject to approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FINCA) in this matter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office (Securities Division)."
