  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against a Michigan man who was charged with defrauding his wife and three children out of millions of dollars.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Michigan, alleges that, in October 1975, defendant and his wife left India to settle a custody dispute in Michigan.  According to the complaint, the defendants were forced to sign away all of their property and assets in India in order to make a custody determination.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants took all of plaintiff\u2019s jewelry, her passport, and her passport from their home state of India, where they had resided for more than six consecutive months immediately before the filing of the divorce action.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, defendant had promised that she and the children could return to the United States in five to six months if they did not like India, and that he would not allow her to return to Michigan even though she was physically present in India for most of the jurisdictional period.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar in the amount of $1,000,000.   The court also entered a temporary restraining order against defendant and ordered him to surrender all of his assets, including his passport, to a federal district court.  On March 22, 2016, the court granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, ordered the defendants to surrender their passports, and ordered the children to be repatriated to India.  A court hearing on the matter was scheduled for April 5, 2016. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Attorney General's Office, the U.K. Secret Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Canadian Securities and Exchange Commission, the British Columbia Securities Commission, and other relevant authorities."
