  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the city of Palmdale, California, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that the California Secretary of State's Office improperly issued a preliminary injunction to prevent the city from conducting an at-large municipal election.  According to the complaint, the SEC's preliminary injunction order, which was issued on September 30, 2013, was issued in violation of Section 14027 of the federal Voting Rights Act.  In its order, the court found that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the federal and state laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date. The court also ordered the city to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-20-2014.  On May 2, 2002, the California Department of Justice announced that it had obtained a temporary restraining order halting the issuance of the preliminary injunction.  A hearing scheduled for June 21, 2002 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter."
