  "summary": "On May 2, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment in favor of Pike County Conservation District (PCED) against Pike CCD, a Pennsylvania-based agency that reviews and acts on applications for on- and off-street parking in Philadelphia.  The court's order, which was entered on a temporary basis, permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5(2) of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) Rules of Practice and Rules of Order, and orders the defendants to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has filed an emergency action to halt the pending litigation.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Pike County, Pennsylvania on May 29, 2019 and unsealed on May 31, 2020, the defendants agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The court also agreed to the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the operation of the conservation district. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by James J. Gory and Ms. Finan. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General."
