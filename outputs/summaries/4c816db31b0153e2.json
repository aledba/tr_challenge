  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Andrew Dennis Johnson, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 15 years with 5 years of probation, and ordered to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Anchorage, alleges that Johnson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  According to the complaint, Johnson agreed to a five-year probation term with the stipulation that he would be prohibited from having contact with his wife, Holly Johnson, or his son, Spencer Johnson, unless he was in compliance with probation or parole. Johnson also agreed to be barred from associating with another felon absent permission by a family court judge, and to be subject to warrantless searches of his person, personal property, residence, or any vehicle in which he is found for the presence of alcohol or drug paraphernalia.

The judgment also prohibits Johnson from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a state or federal agency, and prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for at least five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Spencer Johnson.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Johnson, charging him with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest from Johnson and Spencer Johnson in connection with the alleged violations of Section 13(b)(5) and 13(a)(2) of"
