  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment against Oklahoma Attorney General Jeff Sessions for the purpose of recovering attorney fees that were improperly awarded.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, alleges that, in 2004 and 2005, the trial court improperly awarded $22,900 in attorney fees to a Lincoln County, Oklahoma man who claimed that he had been injured by 2,4-D herbicide applied on his property.  According to the complaint, the court found that the amount of attorney fees sought by the plaintiff was in excess of those typically paid by attorneys for litigation in Oklahoma, and that he was unable to find any of his time records or financial records.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court improperly denied the plaintiff's request for an attorney fee based on a contingency fee contract he had with his former counsel.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $45,000.  On March 2 and 3, 2015, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and imposing a civil injunctive action against the defendants.   The court's order, which was entered without prejudice, permanently enjoins the defendants from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Separately, the Court granted the defendants' motion for an asset freeze, ordered the destruction of property, and ordered the payment of civil penalties.  As set forth in the order, the settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Oklahoma Department of Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Oklahoma Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
