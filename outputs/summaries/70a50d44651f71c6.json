  "summary": "On January 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania issued an order granting the trustee's request to transfer an adversary proceeding to the district court for the district of Pennsylvania.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in 2008, IMMC Corp. filed a petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, alleging that Appellees had breached their fiduciary duties by pursuing a risky and costly litigation strategy in an unrelated suit against a competitor, overcompensating themselves in the process.  According to the complaint, the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over the adversary proceeding, but did not have the authority to transfer it under \u00a71631.  In a parallel action, on Jan. 2, 2019, the Court of Appeals for the District of Delaware denied the trustee\u2019s motion to transfer, finding that the court lacked jurisdiction to deal with the matter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, however, the trustee has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.  Finally, the court granted the trustee a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  On Jan. 4, 2020, the SEC filed an emergency action seeking to bar the trustee from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and from participating in any bankruptcy proceeding.  To learn more about bankruptcy court jurisdiction, see Litig. Tr. v. Price Waterhouse, Inc., No. 10-53063-KJC, 2011 WL 6832900 (Bankruptcy Court, Dec. 29, 2011).  The complaint also alleges that the trustee failed to disclose to the court that bankruptcy courts are not \"units\" of the federal court, that they are not subject to the same jurisdiction as district courts, and that, as a matter of law, they have the power to impose sanctions under \u00a7\u20191631 without the court having jurisdiction to do so.  As a result, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the anti-bailout provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) and (c) of The Securities and Exchange Commission's Rules of Practice, and an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver will determine the appropriate amount of relief to be provided to the receiver.  For further information see Litigation Release No. 15-11178 (Dec. 22, 2014).  In related matters,"
