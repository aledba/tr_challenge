  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, which is charged with violating the dormant Commerce Clause of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on June 28, 2019, alleges that, since 2007, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PTC) has increased tolls for the purpose of maintaining and operating the state-of-the-art turnpike.  According to the complaint, the increase in tolls is unrelated to the toll road itself, and the amount of the tolls collected exceeds the amount it costs to run the state\u2019s toll road.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the toll increases are not a violation of the dormant commerce clause, because they are not imposed on both in-and-out- of-state drivers.  As alleged, however, the imposition of the additional tolls has not materially harmed the right to travel.  For example, the SEC alleges that in 2007, Pennsylvania passed a law requiring the PTC to collect and spend tolls before it could spend them.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the court granted the Commission's motion for a temporary restraining order, which was entered by the court on June 29, 2019.  On June 30, 2020, the Court entered a default judgment against the defendants, permanently enjoining the defendants from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and ordering the Commission to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Philadelphia Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Timothy J. Donahue and Ms. Ciampi of the Market Abuse Unit, with assistance from Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
