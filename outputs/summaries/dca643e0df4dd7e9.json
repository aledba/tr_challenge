  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former high school social studies teacher for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Wesley Geer was terminated on April 7, 2016, as a result of certain charges brought against him.  According to the complaint, DiMaria, then-principal of the Gates-Chili Central School District, told plaintiff that he was entitled to absolute immunity for his role in the district's alleged misconduct, conduct unbecoming a teacher and insubordination, and that he did not disclose any confidential information to the district or the Board of Education.  In addition, the complaint alleges that DiMaria told her students that she would \"take if from here\" if they had misbehaved in some manner during the course of their work.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance of any civil injunctive relief.  Additionally, the court granted a temporary restraining order and an officer-and-director bar against DiMaria and the District, ordering her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000.  DiMaria has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for the rest of his life.  On June 27, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the New York Court of Appeals entered a judgment that permanently enjoins DiMaria from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders him to pay a $2,500 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  A hearing scheduled for July 5, 2019, is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Feb. 23, 2016).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, under the supervision of Amy C. Welshhans. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the U.N. Secret Service."
