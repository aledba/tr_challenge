  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of Paul Hupp, a California-based attorney who has been declared a vexatious litigant by the court.  The SEC's complaint, filed on January 25, 2016, alleges that Paul, a resident of Beaumont, California, and his wife, Kimberly Jean Kempton, of California, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 391 of the California Code of Civil Procedure.  According to the complaint, the court found that Paul failed to adequately disclose to the court that he had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoCA) that required him to file a complaint with the court with the Commission on Civil Litigation (CC&Rs).  The complaint further alleged that Paul was acting as a puppet or conduit for Paul\u2019s aggressive litigation practices, and that he did not obtain a prefiling order allowing him to do so.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Aristea, who lives across the street from the Hupps, filed a complaint in the same district court as Paul in March 2014, alleging that Paul violated the federal securities laws by failing to obtain a pre-judgment judgment ordering him to comply with the MoCA requirements.  As alleged in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Paul violated Sections 391, and 391(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, 13b2-2, and 14a-13 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Paul has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Paul has also agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from participating in any future litigation, either in his own name or in the name of an attorney, without first obtaining leave of the presiding judge to file the complaint.  On March 1, 2017, a federal district court in Riverside, California entered a judgment ordering Paul to pay $150,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, and to be barred from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  This settlement is subject to court approval.  Among other things, Aristea has agreed to the appointment of a receiver to assist her in recovering her ill-gotten gains plus interest, to the issuance of a cease-and-desist order and to the payment of a $50,000 civil penalty.  A hearing on March 21, 2017 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m."
