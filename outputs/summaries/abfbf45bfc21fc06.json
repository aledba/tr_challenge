  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Midland Funding, LLC, a debt collection company, on the basis of a finding that Midland violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston on August 14, 2017, Midland filed a complaint in federal district court in Massachusetts with the SEC alleging that it improperly assigned the Khath Account to Midland.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to the court's finding, the defendants were not bound by the arbitration provisions of the agreement and Midland was entitled to rely on the arbitration.  Midland also allegedly failed to show that it had obtained the right to arbitrate with Midland in the prior adjudication.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court also ordered Midland to pay a civil penalty of $21,798, which is equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On August 16, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking to bar Midland from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and from obtaining an officer or director of a public company.  Among other things, the complaint seeks to have Midland consented to the entry of an order requiring it to pay civil penalties of $1,000,000 and $2,500, respectively, for each of the defendants' alleged violations of the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, as well as an order imposing a bar on Midland's entry of a judgment imposing a $10,000 civil penalty against the defendant.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Eric Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office, and the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office in this matter."
