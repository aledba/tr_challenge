  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Eden Township Healthcare District (EMC) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1717 of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alameda County, California, alleges that, in 1998, the District owned and operated multiple hospitals, including Eden, in Castro Valley.  According to the complaint, Sutter Health, a member of the District's board of directors, agreed to pay $262 million to construct a new hospital to replace Eden, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the District entered into an agreement with Sutter to acquire the right to a buy-sell agreement, without which it would not have been entitled to attorney fees under the terms of the contract.  As alleged, the 2008 agreements contained a provision for attorney fees and costs, and Sutter agreed to spend the same amount on the new hospital, secured by a $260 million escrow deposit.  Sutter then filed two actions seeking to avoid arbitration, alleging that Sutter had breached an obligation to convert the fourth floor of an acute care emergency services hospital to an acute rehabilitation hospital, and that EMC was entitled to fees for prevailing on those actions.  On August 29, 2012, the trial court entered an order denying EMC's motion for a preliminary injunction, freezing the assets of EMC, and ordering EMC to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  EMC has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders it to pay attorney fees, and imposes a $25,000 civil penalty against Sutter.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.   The court's order against EMC is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Secretary of State's Office."
