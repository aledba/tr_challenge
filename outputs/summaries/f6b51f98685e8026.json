  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of three felony counts of premeditated rape, two counts of second-degree unlawful sexual penetration, and one count of unlawful delivery of methamphetamine to a minor.  The court found that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay a $50,000 compensatory fine.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Oregon, defendant met S, a thirteen-year-old girl, at a strip club, where she performed nude for customers and engaged in sexual acts with Toth and some of the club\u2019s customers. The complaint alleges that S was not entitled to the full amount of medical expenses that she sought to recover as a result of her criminal activities, and that, in fact, she did not have to pay any of the compensatory fines.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against S.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Justice. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oregon Department of Health and Human Services, and the Arizona Department of Insurance. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov."
