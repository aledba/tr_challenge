Al-Thanayyan in a civil case brought by his wife, Tiffany Lee Lehn, against the family court's order to impose a $2.5 million bond on Father.  The court found that Father violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by improperly allocating community property and debt in violation of those provisions and by failing to properly consider the relative financial resources, Mother's ability to pay her own fees, and Father\u2019s ability to make a reasonable determination of her share of the community interest in the businesses.

As alleged in the complaint, Father had told one child to lie to Mother about having a cell phone and had told the child he was old enough to visit Kuwait on his own and \u201cmore than that.\u201d  The complaint also alleges that Father had falsely claimed that Mother had left Kuwait without legal justification and submitted a power of attorney stating that he was the natural guardian of the children. The complaint further alleges that the court had no basis for this unequal allocation because the court did not consider Father's claims about his business interests when it imposed the bond.  Finally, the complaint alleges that, contrary to what the court found, Father did not conceal his income from Kuwait and was unable to pay his civil penalty as required by the"
