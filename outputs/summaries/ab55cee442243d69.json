  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California today entered a final judgment against a California-based healthcare venture capital fund for failing to comply with a provision of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in California, alleges that Alicia Kao, the President of Advanced China Healthcare, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Kao told the Suns that all funds would be used for the development and opening of medical centers in China, but had converted and misappropriated $2.8 million for her own use or to cover up her prior misappropriation of other investments.  Kao also allegedly had no right to challenge the SEC's finding that she had violated the forum-selection clause.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Suns agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal and state securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $2,857, which is equal to the amount of their ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Kao.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Mascianica entered final judgments against the defendants, finding that Kao violated the securities laws and ordering her to disgorge her gains with interest, pay civil penalties, and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The court also ordered Kao to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty and ordered her to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in a parallel criminal case.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1771."
