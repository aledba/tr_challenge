  "summary": "On September 21, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida entered a final judgment against Western Surety Company, Inc., a company that issues surety bonds on construction projects.  According to the SEC's complaint, on June 24, 2014, Western, as a subcontractor, entered into an agreement with a general contractor, Harry Pepper & Associates, Inc. (\"HPA\"), that it would pay $1.3 million to complete the work of the project.  The complaint alleges that, on or about August 27, 2015, Western sent a letter to HPA informing it that it was in default of its obligation under Section 4 of the contract and that it needed to pay a $2.7 million civil penalty.  Western also allegedly failed to timely respond to its request for a preliminary injunction.  In its complaint, filed in federal district court in Miami, the SEC alleges that Western violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Western consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the civil penalty that Western has agreed to.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Mark W. Alexander, John Rymas, and Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office, with the assistance of trial counsel Robert C. Hannan of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Alexander and Ms. Gibson, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the United States Postal Inspection Service."
