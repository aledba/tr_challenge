  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two former executives of Match Group, Inc., alleging that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on August 5, 2019, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, Gregory Blatt and Rosette Pambakian, former chief operating officers of Match, agreed to settle the case by agreeing to arbitration without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Blatt also agreed to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty.  The SEC alleges that Blatt violated the anti-fraud provision of the Exchange Act by filing a complaint with the SEC in August 2018, alleging that he violated the arbitration provision.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Blatt.  On August 13, 2018, the SEC filed an enforcement action against Pambakiian, a former CEO of Match who was charged with defrauding investors by making false and misleading statements to investors about the value of the company's stock.  Without admitting to the allegations, Blatt agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $1,500 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $2,500 each.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1779 (Aug. 5, 2018).  The Complaint also alleges that, in a parallel proceeding, Pambakaian and Blatt conspired to defraud a New York-based company by filing an arbitration motion in which they were jointly and severally liable for Blatt's violations.  Pambaskaian has agreed to a settlement where she will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  A hearing scheduled for September 6, 2019 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  To learn more about how to spot securities fraud, see Investor.gov/InvestorSecurities.
