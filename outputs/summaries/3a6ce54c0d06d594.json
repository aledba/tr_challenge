  "summary": "On May 26, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington entered a final judgment against Julia Tucker, who was convicted of stealing a snowmobile.  The court found that Tucker violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) and (b)(5)(B).  According to the court's order, Tucker was charged with theft of a motor vehicle and was sentenced to 26 months in prison.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Tucker.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Seattle, charges Tucker with violating the anti-harassment provisions of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Tucker consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 26 months.  Tucker agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the purchase, sale, or offer of any security, including the right to reapply as an officer or director of a public company after five years of service.  He also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the securities laws and to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71 plus prejudgment interest of $2,094.71, a penalty of $100,000, and a $50,000 civil penalty.  On August 18, 2018, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Tucker, ordering him to surrender his passport and to be barred from the securities industry for a period of five years, and imposing a $25,000 officer-and-director bar.  A hearing for Tucker is scheduled for September 7, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2017.  This case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Cheryl L. Berry, and Kurt L. Gottschall of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Washington State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Insurance Regulatory Surveillance Authority in this matter."
