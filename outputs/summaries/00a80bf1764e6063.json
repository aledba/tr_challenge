  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 136 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least February 2008 through at least January 2015, Richard Ferry, a California resident, repeatedly threatened to harm a woman who was being battered by her husband, telling her to \"listen\" and \"don't talk to the fucking police.\"  According to the complaint, the defendant told the woman that he was going to use her testimony to determine whether or not her husband had committed any of the crimes charged against him.  He also allegedly claimed that he had confronted the woman on numerous occasions and had told her not to tell the police, and that she had called the police when she was \"mad and angry.\"  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant had threatened to call the police if she did not cooperate with the SEC's investigation.  In a parallel criminal action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Ferry.  On September 8, 2015, the U. S. District Judge in Manhattan entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating Section 136 and orders him to pay a civil penalty of four years and a $1,000,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of five years, $1 million, and $1.5 million, respectively.  To settle the SEC case, defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged conduct of a person who has been falsely accused of a crime.  Defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to permanent injunctions and to the imposition of civil penalties by the court upon motion of the court.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-0117 (January 2015).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the New York Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter, including the Office of Inspector General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the United Kingdom Postal Inspection Service."
