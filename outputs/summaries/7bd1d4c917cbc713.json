  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island today entered a final judgment in favor of the Board of Medical Examiners against Sinapi, a Rhode Island resident with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. The court found that Sinapi violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the Board and its members were entitled to quasi-judicial immunity from violations of the federal securities laws. According to the court's order, Sinapi filed an amended complaint on July 24, 2015, alleging that he was denied access to the Board's independent medical evaluation, which the court ultimately denied. The Court also found that, despite Sinapi's efforts, the Board was unable to determine whether he was a \"prevailing party\" under federal law. In a parallel case, the court issued a judgment that permanently enjoins Sinapi from future violations of this provision, and orders him to pay a $19,486.00 fee and $400.00 in costs. The SEC's order also prohibits the Board from issuing an emergency restraining order or issuing an order requiring Sinapi to retake the bar exam. Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the board and members in their official capacities have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Rhode Island Department of Health and Human Services, and the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office in this matter.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. The Office of Compliance has also issued an Investor Alert about potential conflicts of interest arising from the issuance of the TRO.  In a related matter, the Department of Justice today announced that it had obtained an emergency court order requiring the Board to comply with an order appointing an independent medical examiner to review the merits of an appeal. The Department of Education also announced that, in a parallel administrative proceeding, it had issued an order granting the Board a temporary restraining order requiring it to provide timely and accurate information about the state's progress in its investigation of ADHD and related issues. The order also requires the District Court to approve the settlement of the litigation."
