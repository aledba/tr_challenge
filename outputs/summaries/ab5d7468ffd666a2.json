  "summary": "On June 7, 2012 the Environmental Protection Agency issued another rule in a long succession of actions implementing Congress\u2019s effort to restore air quality and visibility in certain national parks and wilderness areas (\u201cClass I areas\u201d) to what they would be under natural conditions.  According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the federal agency issued a final rule on May 12, 2012, that permanently enjoins states from violating the federal antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders states to submit \"best available\" retrofit technology (BART) SIPs by August 1977.  The complaint also alleges that EPA improperly failed to consider CSAPR as a better-than-BART alternative when it issued its final CAIR-related rule in June 2012.  In its final order, which was issued on May 13, 2013, the court ordered EPA to consider CAIR as an adequate BART alternative until states could demonstrate a local alternative better than BART.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the agency has agreed to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering it to conduct a conduct-based analysis of the air quality in the affected states, and requiring it to determine whether there is a reasonable basis for the state to adopt a better than-Bart alternative.  It also ordered that the state and industry petitioners file a civil injunctive action against the agency, which is subject to court approval.  On June 13, 2014, the Court granted the petitioners a temporary restraining order and ordered the agency to proceed with its litigation against the court.   The court granted the request for a permanent injunction and ordered a hearing on June 14, 2014 on the merits of the matter. \u00c2\u00a0The court granted a preliminary injunction on June 13 and ordered an emergency court order halting the litigation.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-19, July 10, 2014.  Separately, the United States Attorney for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  This case is being handled by Scott A. Thompson, Eric R. Werner, David A. Schiff, and Amy C. Welshhans of the Boston Regional Office.  A hearing is scheduled for July 24, 2014 to determine the amount of relief to be provided by the court upon motion by the relief petitioners. "
