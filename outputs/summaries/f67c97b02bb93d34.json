  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a preliminary injunction against the defendants and ordered them to pay over $1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the defendants violated Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  According to the complaint, the defendants made numerous false and misleading statements in their marketing materials, including that they were experts on, or providers of, government-sponsored health insurance, and that they would find the consumer the \"BEST PLAN out there for the BEST PRICE.\"  The complaint also alleges that defendants' deceptive sales scripts, which were sent to consumers after they purchased their insurance, induced them to believe that they had purchased comprehensive health insurance and/or ACA-qualified plans when, in fact, they had not.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Defendants failed to disclose to their customers that certain of the misrepresentations were true.  For example, the SEC alleges that one of the salespeople told one customer that he would \"find a reasonable approximation of a defendant's ill-gotten gains\" if she used their \"in-network\" surgeon.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5, and orders them to disgorge their allegedly misappropriated gains with interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Richard J. Mascianica entered a temporary restraining order against the Defendants, freezing the defendants' assets, and ordering the receivership of the remaining assets. The court also ordered the receiver to provide a copy of the Commission's First Interim Report, which was prepared by the receiver, to be sent to the receiver. The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Tashman and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
