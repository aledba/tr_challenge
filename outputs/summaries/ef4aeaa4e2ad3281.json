  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered final judgments against Vail Summit Resorts, Inc. (VSRI) and its owner for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's order, filed in federal court in Denver on March 11, 2017, the court found that VSRI violated the federal securities laws by failing to enforce certain of the provisions of its exculpatory agreements, including the ski school waiver, the lift ticket waiver, and the ski lesson waiver.  The court also found that, in violation of Section 13(b)(5) and 13(a)(3) of Colorado law, VSRI is liable as a party to a civil injunctive action for violating those provisions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against VSRI.   The SEC's complaint charges VSRI with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 15(d) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and Rule 15a-11 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws, and order them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.5 million, $2 million, and $1 million, respectively, to be determined by the court at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Denver Regional Office by Michael J. Bowers and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Birkenheier. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Office of Inspector General, the Denver Office of Financial Regulation and the Colorado Department of Health and Human Services."
