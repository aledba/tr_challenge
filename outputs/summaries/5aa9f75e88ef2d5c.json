  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jonathan Santillan, who was convicted of two felony counts of premeditated murder and sentenced to life without parole.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that, on 5 January 2013, the defendants kicked in the couple's front door and sprayed every room in the home with gunfire from an AK-47 rifle and.45 caliber handgun. The complaint also alleges that the defendants knew or should have known that, absent the alleged error, the jury probably would have returned a different verdict.  According to the complaint, Santilli allegedly told the officers that he had lived at that residence a year earlier, before the Floreses moved in, and had visited him when he lived there.  Santilli also allegedly told them he believed he was the intended victim.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Santilli initially denied his involvement in both the Sancho and Flores' killings, but later confessed to being present at the Flores' murders and made a detailed description of the victims' home based on information he claimed to have learned from his girlfriend.  He also allegedly gave a statement to police that \"he should be sure and tell his attorney [that] he had a chance to help himself and did not do so.'  The complaint further alleges that he did not explain why, had the rap lyrics not been admitted to the jury, he would have rejected the jury's other evidence and found Santilli not guilty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Santilla has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 549, 519, 556, 557 S.E.2d 583.

The Office of Inspector General\u00c2\u00a0has issued an\u00c2\u00a0investigation\u00c2\u00a0in progress to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify the imposition of a civil penalty."
