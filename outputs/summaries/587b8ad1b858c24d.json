  "summary": "On April 28, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the trustees of the OHI Workers' Compensation Trust, which was insolvent.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 31, 2007, the trust was in severe financial distress and assumed administration of administration of its finances.  The complaint alleges that, in 2011, a later forensic analysis found that the trust had accumulated a deficit of approximately $8.27 million.  As alleged in the complaint, Fuller and the trustees had failed to properly advise the trust regarding its financial condition.  In 2013, the court granted the trustees' motion to dismiss the complaint and ordered the trustees to pay a civil penalty of $8 million, which is subject to a six-year statute of limitations.  On May 4, 2011, the SEC filed an amended complaint alleging that Fuller breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing by failing to disclose the trust's true financial condition and failing to adequately advise the trustees regarding its solvency.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the amended complaint, the trustees agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,038, which will be offset by the amount of their civil penalties.  Additionally, the judgment orders the trustees not to violate the fiduciary duty and common-law indemnification provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933.  It also prohibits the trustees from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security in connection with the trust, and prohibits them from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer or representative of a registered investment adviser.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-cv-8221 (March 21, 2013).  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
