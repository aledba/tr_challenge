  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment in favor of the District Court's order to revoke Le Veque\u2019s probation and subsequently relinquish jurisdiction over him.  The court also issued an order temporarily suspending the probation and relinquishing jurisdiction.  According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed on October 28, 2015, the court issued a temporary restraining order and issued a court order temporarily restraining LeVeque from violating the terms of his probation. The court then relinquished jurisdiction for a period of three years, which is consistent with the standard of review that the court typically uses to determine discretionary decisions.  In its final judgment, the Court found that the district court had improperly exercised its discretion in granting the probation without a finding that the probationer had violated its terms of probation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the judge granted the court's order and relinquished the court-ordered relinquishment of jurisdiction, which was followed by a hearing on November 2, 2015.  On November 3, 2016, the United States District Court in Kootenai County, South Dakota, entered a judgment that permanently restrains the court from violating its previous order and orders it to relinquish its jurisdiction. The Court also granted the Court the right to revoke the probation on a later date and to issue an order appointing a new district court judge to determine whether the probation should be suspended or revoked.  To learn more about the Court's discretion, see Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder, see Litigation Release No. 5(b)(5) or (3) of the Criminal Justice Reform Act of 1940 (Securities Act).  In a parallel action, the Department of Justice today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an emergency court order halting the pendency of the litigation.  A hearing scheduled for November 4, 2016 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Rules 10b2-1, Rules 12b-20, Rules 13a-3, and Rules 13b-11, 13b1-1 and 13b3-11 thereunder.
