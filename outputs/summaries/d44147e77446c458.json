  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia today entered a final judgment against a West Virginia contractor who died of carbon monoxide poisoning.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charleston, West Virginia on November 4, 2015, alleges that William Moran, an employee of the contractor, was not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation dependents\u2019 benefits when there had been a third-party settlement for the same injury. The complaint further alleges that, because the contractor had been sent to West Virginia to lay fiber optic lines at Yeager Airport in Charleston for the West Virginia National Guard, Moran was entitled to receive a credit for her benefit when there was no third party settlement. According to the complaint, however, the payment of her benefits was not offset by the amount of the company\u2019s compensation award. Rather, the complaint alleges that the company paid the company $765.15 in weekly benefits, which was greater than, and credited against, the amount paid by the company in connection with Mrs. Moran's West Virginia award.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of W.Va. today announced criminal charges against Moran. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, with assistance from John Rymas of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia Department of Insurance, the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
