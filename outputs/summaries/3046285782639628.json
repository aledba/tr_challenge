  "summary": "On May 4, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against Texas-based oil and gas company Ridge Natural Resources, L.L.C., denying its motion to compel arbitration based on a non-binding arbitration agreement.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, Texas, Ridge and his sister, Jolinda McDaniel Benjamin, raised the issue of contract malformation with the trial court, and Ridge and their sister-in-law agreed to settle the case by agreeing to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Ridge from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the federal securities laws.  The court also denied Ridge's motion for an injunction, which would have prevented Ridge from entering into an arbitration agreement with the McDaniels.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Ridge.  On May 5, 2017, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals entered an order against Ridge, ordering him to pay $104,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Fort Worth office by John Rymas and Eric Werner, and the litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Texas Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related case, the SEC filed an emergency action on May 5 against Ridge and Gibson, Inc., charging him with violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Ridge's violations of Exchange Act Section 5.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Ridge has consented to entry of an order permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions, and to the issuance of a civil injunctive relief"
