  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Icon, a Vermont-based company, and three other defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Icon violated Rule 26(e) by failing to timely produce documents related to its discovery of a defective modular home.  According to the complaint, Icon failed to produce any documents relevant to the discovery of the defective home, and instead failed to timely respond to the court's order requiring it to do so.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the trial court failed to consider the fact that Icon had failed to comply with its discovery obligations and failed to provide sufficient evidence to justify a default judgment against it.  Icon's complaint also alleges that it failed to inform Trevor of its obligations to provide proof of liability in the event that the court found it liable for liability arising from the discovery violations.    The complaint further alleges that, in its response to Trevor's second motion for sanctions, Icon admitted to its failure to produce all of the documents requested by Trevor, and that it did not have the resources to respond to any of the requested documents.  Finally, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the destruction of documents, including documents that were previously discovered, from being used as evidence in a litigation-ending sanction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court order, Icon has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, as well as civil penalties, in the amount of $310,886.58, a $100,000 civil penalty, and a $25,000 officer-and-director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the New York Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter, and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice, Criminal Investigation, and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
