  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin today entered final judgments in favor of a Wisconsin-based company and its agent in an emergency action related to the Sweet Applewood Festival.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison, Wis., alleges that the Lions Club of Cudahy Wisconsin and its subagent Steven Fry violated the antifraud provisions of Section 895.52 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from 2012 through 2013, Fryed and his company, Rhythm Method, LLC, provided music for the festival. The complaint alleges that, in 2012, when Mr. Fry and his group were performing at the festival, he laid cords on the floor of the music tent for Rhythm Method's amplified sound.  In 2013, the court of appeals ruled that Rhythm Method and Fryed had the right to control how the cords were laid and whether safety precautions were to be employed.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (2014).  The case is being handled by David T. Prosser, Jr. of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and the Wisconsin State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
