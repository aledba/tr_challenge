  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Alexandria resident Krista McClellan, who was arrested for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 2, 2016 in Alexandria, Virginia, McClelland performed Schubert's Ave Maria in downtown Alexandria, Va., with the aid of a small, portable Bluetooth speaker. The complaint alleges that the city's noise control code, on its face and as applied to her, prohibits anyone from generating excessive, unnecessary, or unusually loud noise when performing in the central business district.  The complaint also alleges that, on the night she was arrested, she took precautions designed to ensure that her performance remained under the 75-db threshold, and that she did not cause any adverse effect upon the neighboring inhabitants.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that she was forced to change her clothing to cover up her appearance.  On September 7, 2016, the Alexandria City Attorney's Office filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in Alexandria against the City of Alexandria and its then-chief of staff, Michael Dunkwu. The court granted the complaint's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alexandria Police Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alexandria Office of Inspector General."
