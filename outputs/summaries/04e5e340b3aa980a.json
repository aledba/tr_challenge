  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment in favor of the Hayses in a child custody case against their father.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 4, 2011, in Tell City, Indiana, Michael and Caryn Hays filed a civil injunctive action against the trial court for improperly granting custody of their son, B.H., to their mother, Amanda Fisher.  The complaint alleges that the court improperly granted custody of the child to Amanda Fisher, who was living in Indiana at the time.  In its judgment, the court found that the child was in the best interests of his mother and father, and granted her the right to return to Indiana to reside with her.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay $6,364.00 in attorney fees and $1,365.50 in civil penalties.  Additionally, the judgment requires the court to determine a reasonable amount of attorney fees to be paid to each of the parties.  On May 18, a federal district court in Indianapolis issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the return of all assets held by the defendants to the court.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael Hays and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Indiana Department of Children and Family Education, and the Indiana Office of Child Advocacy. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Advocacy and Education has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
