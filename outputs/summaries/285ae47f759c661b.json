  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against Nicholas Brusseau, a Southaven, Mississippi man who was convicted of armed robbery based on evidence that he used a gun to rob another young man when they met to make a trade involving some Nike Air Jordan shoes and designer clothes.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, on June 12, 2016, Jones, then sixteen years old, told his girlfriend, Alyssa Lagomarsino, that he was going to steal her cell phone. The complaint alleges that Jones then demanded that she borrow the phone, and that he then held the gun at his side and pointed it at her.  The complaint further alleges that, despite the overwhelming evidence presented to the jury, Jones did not use a gun. Instead, the complaint alleges, he simply took possession of the phone and used it to steal the phone.  As alleged in the complaint, Jones also used the phone to steal two pairs of jeans, which he claimed were worth $400 a pair, rather than the promised Robin's jeans.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jones arising from the same conduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Jones consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a public figure. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kelly L. Gibson, Patrick J. Mascianica, and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Werner. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
