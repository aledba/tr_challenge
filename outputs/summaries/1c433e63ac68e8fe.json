  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the hospital defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by a former supervisor who had been diagnosed with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Brooklyn, New York, on December 10, 2014, Helen Whitehurst was terminated from her job as a dispatcher/emergency medical technician at Staten Island University Hospital. Whitehurst alleges that she was deemed a probationary employee for her first 90 days in this new position and was not entitled to a right to a grievance process or to a fair representation. The complaint further alleges that Whitehurst failed to disclose her condition to her supervisor, Melissa Hamm, during her shift on the 10th and 11th of December 2014, which Whitehurst noticed on both occasions. According to Whitehurst, Hamm told Whitehurst that she had failed her probation due to falling asleep at her work station and would therefore be fired.  Whitehurst allegedly told the hospital and the union, for the first time, that her two incidents of sleepiness were caused by her medical condition.  The complaint alleges that, regardless of the employer\u2019s awareness of her condition, Whitehurst did not inform the hospital or the union about her condition until after her termination.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending Whitehurst from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of six months. The SEC also instituted an administrative proceeding against the hospital, which is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC has also instituted a settled administrative proceeding, which includes a hearing on the merits of the case.  On May 24, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the hospital from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the hospital to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000. The court also ordered the hospital not to violate the anti-discrimination provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. In addition, the court granted the hospital's request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 301 of the federal securities laws, and ordered the company to comply with the court order. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 206"
