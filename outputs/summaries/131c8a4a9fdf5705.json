  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Stony Brook University and its former Director of Education, Daniel Verdejo, in a civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 23, 2014, Verdeo, then a second-year student at the university, was harassed by a student in his dormitory during a disciplinary hearing.  The complaint alleges that, despite being told repeatedly that she had a right to a hearing and to be able to present her case at a later date, the school did not respond to the student's requests for a hearing or to a response to the alleged harassment.  In a complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC alleges that the university violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Rules 5b2-1, 5a-11, and 13a-13 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged conduct.  Additionally, the court granted the university's request for a preliminary injunction, which prohibits it from issuing or selling any security or other security measures, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On May 24, 2014 the court issued a temporary restraining order, which temporarily enjoins the defendants from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  At the same time, the Court issued an order requiring the defendants to comply with the requirements of the federal reporting laws, including the reporting and disciplinary provisions of the reporting requirements, and to provide an accounting of the alleged misconduct in the course of the investigation.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Compliance and Assessments with the assistance of the Division of Education's Office of Inspector General. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Boston Regional Office."
