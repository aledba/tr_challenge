  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee today entered a final judgment against the City of Chattanooga, Tenn., and the County of Knoxville in a civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the Tennessee Department of Revenue (DOR) and the Tennessee Attorney General's Office (AGO) issued an opinion in July 2014 that found that the federal district attorney's office (\"AGO\") and the Department of Education (\"DOE\") violated the antifraud provisions of Section 57-4-306 of the federal tax distribution statute.  The SEC alleges that the AGO's opinion, which was issued in April 2014, was inconsistent with the representations made in the SEC filings.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a matter of law, the District Attorney\u2019s Office and the Commissioner of Revenue had no authority to determine whether a city was required to expend and distribute half of its LBD tax proceeds to the county or to any other local school system.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC complaint, DOR and the Attorney General have agreed to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties.  DOR has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which will be determined by the court at a later date. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney General and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for Tennessee today announced criminal charges against the city of Chattanooga for its role in the alleged distribution of liquor-by-the-drink tax proceeds.
