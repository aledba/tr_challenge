  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in favor of the cable operators in a case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission against them.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Maine, alleges that, in 2004, the federal government issued an order requiring cable operators to carry certain programming in bundles.  According to the complaint, the order was issued in response to a complaint filed by a member of a cable company's board of directors.  In its order, the court found that the cable operator had First Amendment rights in exercising its control over the content of its cable services, and that it had the right to impose a \"must-carry\" provision on cable operators.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Cable Act, and orders them to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On December 26, 2019, the Honorable Kathleen M. Burns of the U.N. District Office for the Eastern District of Maine granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order against the defendants, which is subject to court approval. The Commission's order, which was entered in a parallel administrative proceeding, requires the Commission to consider the merits of the complaint and determine whether it is appropriate to issue an order imposing a preliminary injunction.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 544(f).  The Commission has also issued an Order suspending the issuance of an order suspending the sale and purchase of securities of cable companies in violation of the federal securities laws, and ordering a hearing on the matter to be conducted by the Commission. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Regulatory Affairs in this matter."
