  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against defendants in a mining case brought by the California Department of Commerce.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, charges defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the complaint, defendants raised the issue of a vested right to mine on public land in violation of the federal securities laws.  In its order, the court found that defendants had a legitimate duty to mine the public land, and that defendants were entitled to a right to do so based on that duty.  As alleged in the SEC's order, defendants failed to show sufficient evidence to support their claim that the vested right extended to the entire SHM tract, including expansion into new areas at the time the mining operation was shut down.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933, and orders them to pay civil penalties of $75 million and $30 million, respectively, to be determined by the court at a later date.  On March 24, 2017, the Honorable Judge Paul G. G. Sansone of the United States District Court in Sacramento entered a judgment against the defendants, ordering them to disgorge their illusory gains, impose civil penalties, and pay civil injunctive relief in the amount of $25,000, $1,500, and $10,000.  A hearing on the proposed settlement is scheduled for May 26, 2017. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Secretary of State's Office, the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Office of Financial Regulation."
