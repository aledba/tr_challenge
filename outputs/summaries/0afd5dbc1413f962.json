  "summary": "On July 26, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against HSBC Holdings, plc, HSBC Bank USA, N.A., and Al Rajhi Bank for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that HSBC, which is incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and maintains its principal place of business there, entered into a highly organized program to make financial payments to terrorist groups al-Qaeda and al-Shabaab. The complaint alleges that, among other things, that the defendants provided financial services to clients that purportedly were associated with al Qaeda and aided al Qaeda, and that the two Chicago branch banks were either holding Iranian government assets or had any knowledge of where those assets might be held.  According to the complaint, the defendants did not have sufficient minimum contacts with the United States to qualify for a prima facie case of personal jurisdiction over the defendants.  In addition, the complaint alleges the defendants failed to adequately represent to the court that they had no connection to the November 2005 attack that resulted in the default judgment for HSBC.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, HSBC and the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The final judgments also order the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.5 million, $2 million, and $750,000, respectively, to be deemed satisfied by the court's approval of the settlements.  On August 2, 2016, the court granted a request for a temporary restraining order against HSBC and its related entities from violating Rule 12(b)(6) and ordering the companies to comply with the court order. The court also granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against HSBC-North America, HSBC-Middle East, and HSBC&Middle East from furthering their alleged violations of Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and to impose a civil penalty of $500,000.  Separately, the SEC announced that it had obtained an asset freeze against HSBC, and a court order freezing the assets of HSBC and Middle East, ordering the asset freeze and other emergency relief ordered by the Court. The SEC also issued an order requiring the bank to provide an accounting of its assets and to pay a $50,000 civil penalty."
