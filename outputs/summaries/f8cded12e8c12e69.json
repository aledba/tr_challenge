  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California yesterday entered a final judgment against a former California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation attorney who was later found liable for misconduct for lying to a quasi-judicial officer while representing a state agency.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Pamela J. Palmieri was terminated on December 13, 2010, for misconduct related to her conduct as an attorney representing a prison employee.  According to the complaint, Palmieri told her supervisor that she had the right to take a one-hour lunch regardless of the fact that Krestoff had not given her enough time for lunch.  Palmieri also allegedly claimed that her supervisor had instructed her to take an hour for lunch when she was supposed to take it at 2:00 p.m.  She also claimed that she was late returning from breaks.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Palmieri.  On March 24, 2016, the Honorable Judge William G. Donnelly of the Federal Court of Los Angeles found Palmieri liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Donnelly also found that Palmieri violated the reporting provisions of Sections 901 and 902 of the federal securities laws, and that the Board had discretion whether to approve or reject Palmieri\u2019s motion for summary judgment against her.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the Board consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Palmieri from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of her disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 589-592, July 17, 2016.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in San Diego, charging Palmieri with violations of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rules 206(3) and 206 (4)-8 thereunder; Rules 206a-11, 206(8), 206"
