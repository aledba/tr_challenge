  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana yesterday entered a final judgment against Lamarco Toussaint, a Fort Wayne, Indiana man, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fort Wayne on December 23, 2017, alleges that, on December 24, 2017 at the Fort Wayne Regional Office, Chapman and his friend, J.H., had dinner at a local restaurant in Ft. Wayne. According to the complaint, Chapman allegedly told JH. that he had been convicted of false informing on August 24, 2008 and had been sentenced to 180 days suspended, with one year of unsupervised probation, which had been completed on September 1, 2009. The complaint alleges that Chapman was not credible because he had a prior conviction for false informing. The SEC alleges that the trial court improperly admitted the evidence of Chapman's prior conviction as a form of impeachment evidence, and that Chapman violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act by failing to provide reasonable written notice to the fact-finder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Chapman consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Chapman.  On January 24, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Chapman, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a conduct-based injunction. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and John R. Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Fort Worth Police Department, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release Order No. 542 F.3d 1021, 1028."
