  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Choice Plus, LLC, a private investigative agency registered with the Department of Financial Services, for failing to timely disburse funds from the estate of Mrs. Inez Eleanor Rigley that were being held by the Department.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, alleges that Choice Plus failed to meet its duty as custodian over certain types of unclaimed property.  According to the complaint, the Department improperly ignored a valid order from the court that determined that Mrs. Rigley died intestate, having no known beneficiaries.  In addition, Choice Plus allegedly failed to show that the ten claimants were entitled to the estate funds, despite the fact that the probate court had previously ruled that the estate was entitled to such funds.  Choice Plus also failed to provide sufficient documentation connecting the individual claimants to the relevant documents in the court's order.   The complaint further alleges that the Department overstepped its authority by failing to apply the panoply of tools in chapter 717 to funds that it had previously disbursed to the Department, including the genealogical charts and researcher's report that had been relied upon by the court.

Additionally, the final order requires Choiceplus to provide a copy of the relevant SEC order, which is required by Section 732.107 of the Florida Probate Rules, to be filed with the court upon receipt of a determination of entitlement to the funds, and to provide an accounting of the amount of the funds deposited with the state pursuant to Section 733.816(3).  The final order also requires ChoicePlus to submit a \"self-addressed\" statement to the court indicating that it has jurisdiction to determine entitlement to certain unclaimed funds under the federal securities laws, and that it is obligated to provide for payment of costs and fees.  For example, the SEC previously issued a Notice of Intent to deny Choice Plus's request to disburse $98,185.79 in estate funds in violation of the federal district court order, and the court issued a final order to reject Choiceplus's request for a temporary restraining order against future violations of Sections 732 and 732 of the"
