  "summary": "On December 8, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against a former fireman who was found liable for his or her employer's violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's order, filed in federal court in Pittsburgh on April 8, 2015, Anne Marie Flaherty (\"Flaherty\") provided timely notice to her employer of the possible connection between her work and cancer when she received a letter of distribution from her union informing her of the new firefighter cancer presumption.  The complaint alleges that Flaherty provided notice within 21 days of discovering that her cancer was work-related.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Flaherty.   The SEC's complaint, filed on April 9, 2016, charges Flaherty with violations of Sections 301(e) and 301(f), of the federal securities laws, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Flaherty consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000.  Flaherty also agreed to pay $2,500 in prejudgment interest and a $100,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David Hausmann and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
