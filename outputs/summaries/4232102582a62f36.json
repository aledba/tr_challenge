  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc. (\"Jacobs\"), a Tennessee-based company that managed the Kingston Fossil Fuel Plant cleanup and remediation efforts.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Jacobs violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Jacobs failed to show that he had breached the duty to protect workers from fly ash exposure, and failed to adequately train or warn workers about the dangers of fly ash.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to Jacobs's representations to the jury, Jacobs did not perform his duties as required by the Exchange Act.  As alleged, Jacobs also failed to inform the jury that he was liable for any ill-gotten gains or losses caused by his conduct.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Jacobs consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,500, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Jacobs also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar, barring him from participating in any type of conduct that constitutes a \"prejudgmentable\" violation of the securities laws.  On January 11, 2019, the court granted Jacobs's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered a preliminary injunction against future violations, ordering Jacobs to comply with the court's order, and ordering a new trial.  A hearing is scheduled for February 21, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (January 18, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, under the supervision of C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi, and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
