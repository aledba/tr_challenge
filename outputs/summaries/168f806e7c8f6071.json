  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Rhode Island today announced charges against a Newport, Rhode Island man for failing to keep the peace and be of good behavior while on probation.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on June 26, 2015, the Newport County District Court entered a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins defendant Jeffrey M. Demers from violating his probation in all three criminal cases he has been convicted of.  According to the complaint, Demers, who was the prosecuting attorney at the time of the three convictions, falsely represented to the court that defendant had violated his probation by failing to comply with the requirements of Section 12-19-18(b)(5) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 12-20-1 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that the court improperly dismissed the charges against defendant based on the fact that, at one point early in the case, defendant had imprisoned the complaining witness, by preventing her from leaving his apartment when he arrived there.  In a parallel action, the Rhode Island Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Demers.  On August 2, 2017, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court of Common Pleas granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and a conduct-based injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of The Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  Demers agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the appointment of a hearing justice. The hearing justice also agreed to the issuance of an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The order also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock or offering of any security in the securities industry. The court also ordered Demers to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $20,000 and a $50,000 penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about probation violations, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1717 (R.I. 2017).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the U."
