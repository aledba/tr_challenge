The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that, on August 10, 2016, Izmir was arrested and charged with one count of felonious assault with a deadly weapon.  According to the complaint, after learning of the alleged misconduct, he immediately sought a jury instruction on non-deadly force self-defense.

Izmir also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On June 7, 2016 Izmir's brother, Murad, was arrested by the Ohio Department of Justice and later charged by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in connection with the same case.
