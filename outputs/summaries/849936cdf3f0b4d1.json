  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was sentenced to 12 months in prison for felony theft by deception.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Hampshire, alleges that Laryssa J. Benner violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the court improperly imposed a deferred sentence on the defendant based on the fact that she failed to complete the drug treatment program at Brattleboro College because her insurance expired.  According to the complaint, the deferred sentence was imposed on the basis of a finding by the trial court that the defendant had failed to comply with the terms of her deferred sentence.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, prior to the sentencing order, the defendant told her that she had been let out of her initial drug treatment treatment program because she was informed by her sister that she was being placed on probation in Vermont and being monitored by a bracelet.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Benner consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $'63.00, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar.  Benner also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On May 12, 2017, the court granted the court's request for a temporary restraining order against Benner, and ordered her to surrender her passport and return to her home state of Vermont. The court also granted the defendant's motion for a hearing on May 18, 2017.  As set forth in the complaint filed in the SEC, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to impose the deferred penalty.  For further information, see SEC v. Bensh, 142 N.H. 532, 535, 726 A.2d 1201.  Separately, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern Districts of New Hampshire today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  A hearing scheduled for May 24, 2017 was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. EST. The hearing was delayed until after the defendant pleaded guilty to a felony drug possession charge in Vermont, and the court issued a deferred sentencing order on May 12. The sentencing order requires the defendant to provide a written record of the conduct that triggered the conduct, and to call the receiver to show cause why the deferred commitment should not be imposed."
