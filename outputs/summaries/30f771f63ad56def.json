  "summary": "On May 22, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment in favor of Philadelphia Coca-Cola Co.'s (Coca-Cola) motion to suspend its workers' compensation benefits for 525 days on the basis that it improperly calculated the average weekly wage of a company employee who was incarcerated after a work-related injury.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, Ohio, on July 2, 2012, Claimant sustained an injury while working as a production manager with a Philadelphia-based company. Claimant alleges that, upon his incarceration, he was told to expect to work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week, at $'24.45 an hour, and that his AWW should have been no less than 40 hours per week.  Claimant also alleges that he was expected to work overtime during the summer, which the WCJ did not consider in calculating Claimant's AWW.  The complaint further alleges that the complaint was filed in violation of Section 306(a) of the Worker's Compensation Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Claimant. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Philadelphia Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Office of Compliance and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, and the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services."
