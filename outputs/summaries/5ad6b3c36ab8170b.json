  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a default judgment against Lawrence F. Feldman, a New Jersey-based attorney who has repeatedly failed to comply with discovery orders and agreements.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Jersey on March 12, 2019, Feldman, who represented clients in class action litigation, failed to produce any relevant discovery.  The complaint alleges that, since coming to the court in 2007, Feldman has ignored or defied at least seven discovery orders, including one that required him to turn over at least $1.2 million in legal fees.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Feldman failed to provide any relevant information to AAF, despite repeated requests to do so.  As alleged in the complaint, Feldman's failure to produce discovery resulted in a total of $484,433.76 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Feldman consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a $1,150,000 civil penalty and a $200,000 officer and director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 523(a)(2).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Department of Justice in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Feldman.   The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit."
