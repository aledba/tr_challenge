  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Steven J. Lynch, Jr., the former president and treasurer of the Iceoplex at Southpointe LLC, a multi-million dollar sports bar and restaurant.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges Lynch with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Lynch.  According to the complaint, Lynch agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  Lynch also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and orders him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and a $1,600 special assessment.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Kerstetter of the U.N. Court in Manhattan granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Lynch to pay disgorgment of $2,885,898, which included $793,145 in unpaid taxes paid through SRA Employee Services LLC and Alder Street Management Company during the quarters ending in 2011 and 2015.  Without admitting to the charges, Lynch has consented to the issuance of the final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to repay the $2.885 million he owes to the IRS, and requiring him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 558, 558 (3d Cir. 2009).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the New York Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
