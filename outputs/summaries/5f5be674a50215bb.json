  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a former member of Congress for orchestrating a mail fraud and wire fraud scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, beginning in May 2010, Stephen E. Stockman, then a member of the United States House of Representatives, solicited Stanford Z. Rothschild, Jr., an elderly donor acting through his foundation, to mail Texas voters a fake newspaper called The Conservative News on the eve of the 2010 midterm elections. The complaint alleges that Stockman spent the money on himself, educating himself at Disneyland and other amusement parks, at spas, and riding in hot air balloons. According to the complaint, Stockman also used the money to pay personal expenses, including an abortive venture in South Sudan on which he spent about $13,000 of the money. The SEC also charged Stockman with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c). Stockman has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,014,718.51, prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil penalty of $250,000, and orders Stockman to pay a $150,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert on the subject of mail fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering.  Investors can quickly and easily check whether they are registered to make a purchase using the Investor Alert feature on\u00c2\u00a0Advisers.gov website.  For further information, see Investor Alert: Fraudulent mail fraud is a hallmark of a fraudulent scheme. Investors should be wary of any solicitation of funds for any purpose other than to solicit money from potential candidates. Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to identify whether they're registered professionals.  Stockman's case is being handled by David A. Schiff, Eric R. Werner, and Carolyn M. Welshhans of the Boston Regional Office."
