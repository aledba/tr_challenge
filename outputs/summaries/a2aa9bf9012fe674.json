  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the defendant in a case brought by the Department of Family and Children's Services (DFS).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Santa Clara County, California, alleges that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint further alleges that, contrary to the defendants' representations, the court improperly ordered visitation with J.P., a de facto parent, and an uncharged adult who had been previously incarcerated for driving under the influence.  According to the complaint, the defendant, Albert, who lives with his mother and father in Hirenia C., was not a \"fit parent\" and did not have the \"unfettered right\" to determine who can visit with their child.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Albert, mother, and father did not spend one-on-one time with the children when they were with him, despite the fact that the court found Albert to be a \"daddy\" and ordered him to pay child support for the children.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Albert consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to comply with the court's order.  On October 25, 2018, a federal district court in San Diego entered a temporary restraining order against Albert, ordering him to be removed from mother's physical custody and ordered to consider grandparent visitation. The court also ordered Albert to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, which is the same amount as the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties that the district court previously imposed on Albert.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for November 5, 2018.  To learn more about child custody, see Child Advocacy.gov."
