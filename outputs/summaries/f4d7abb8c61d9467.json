  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota yesterday entered a final judgment against Minneapolis-based developer Alatus Properties, Inc. (\"Alatus\"), which is charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Minneapolis, Alatus proposed to construct a building in Marcy-Holmes, Minnesota, that would meet the requirements of the federal government for a conditional-use permit and a variance. The complaint alleges that the city did not err when it determined that the application was consistent with the comprehensive plan and that the project was within its limitations.  The complaint further alleges that Alatus failed to act in a reasonable and capricious manner when it was required to grant the permit and variance.  In a parallel action, the Minnesota Secretary of State's Office today announced criminal charges against Alatus.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office and is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Minnesota Office of Inspector General in this matter."
