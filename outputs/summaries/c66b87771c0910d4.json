  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a California-based manufacturer of a medical device for causing emotional distress.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Barbara Fortman witnessed the death of her brother Robert Myers while they were scuba diving off the coast of Catalina Island.  According to the complaint, Fortman was present and contemporaneously aware of the injury-producing event when her brother was injured by an improperly prepared injection molding machine.  Fortman also allegedly observed her brother's chest being crushed by the device.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Fortman for her role in the alleged misconduct.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the bystander recovery provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC in the complaint Fortman consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the securities laws, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Los Angeles Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the California Secretary of State's Office."
