  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against defendant Jose Angel Martinez, who was convicted of first-degree murder and later sentenced to life imprisonment.  The court found that Martinez violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Martinez and Berumen agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains or reduce the mandatory minimum penalty for certain third-strike defendants.  According to the court's order, Martinez violated Section 1170.95 of the Exchange Act, which requires defendants to petition the court for a judgment that imposes a penalty equal to the amount of their first- and second-strike sentences, and by declining to give the court the right to determine whether to impose a penalty on a defendant who was not a serious or violent felony.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the judgment, Martinez consented to entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer and director bar, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Martinez, Martinez, Berumen, and the other defendants charged in connection with the same case.  On January 1, 2019, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Martinez to comply with the SEC\u2019s request for an asset freeze and other emergency relief. The court also issued an order suspending Martinez from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering Berumen to cooperate with the agency that administers the SEC, including the SEC Enforcement Division, with the assistance of the Office of Compliance and the Division of Criminal Investigations. The SEC also issued a subpoena to the SEC to obtain a copy of the court order.  A hearing for Martinez is scheduled for May 24, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 597 (2014).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0report.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in New York, charges Martinez with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"). The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties."
