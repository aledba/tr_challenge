  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Hampshire today announced criminal charges against a former investment adviser for charging clients approximately $2.8 million in improper fees.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Curtis S. Ridlon, who was formerly employed as an investment adviser, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Ridlon was charged by the SEC in April 2017 with violating a federal securities law that requires a right to a jury trial. The complaint further alleges that, in the alternative, the SEC seeks a civil penalty of not more than $3,235,000, disgorgement of $1,343,427, and prejudgment interest of up to $2,500. The SEC also seeks a judgment ordering Ridlon to pay civil penalties in the amount of $4,500, $1.5 million, and a penalty equal to the amount required by the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, and orders them to pay a penalty in excess of $6 million. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Financial Regulation today issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, with the assistance of the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.
