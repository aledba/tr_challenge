  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a mother for her role in a recent domestic violence case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least October 2015 through at least August 2017, M.P.-P. K, a daughter of a convicted felon, was removed from her mother\u2019s care. According to the complaint, K was placed in the care of her father, RP, who was also in the custody of the court. The complaint further alleges that K had been placed for adoption in late 2014, shortly before the termination trial, despite repeated requests from the court to remove him from her care. The SEC alleges that mother continued to withhold information about her relationship with her father and, in some instances, refused to participate in services that she knew presented a threat to her and her children. In addition, the complaint alleges that when confronted with reports that mother had not been following through with her parenting training or applying the discipline techniques that she had learned as a child, she repeatedly refused to comply with those recommendations and instead continued to allow her children to be placed in her care despite her repeated requests to be removed from the home. The court ultimately found that mother was unfit to parent K, and ordered her to relinquish her parental rights.  In a parallel action, the Department of Justice today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against Giesick, alleging that she violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC also instituted a temporary restraining order, which was instituted in the wake of the March 2016 domestic violence incident. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Family and Children's Services. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Truhn.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website."
