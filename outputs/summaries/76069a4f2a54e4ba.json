  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Wallace R. McCullough in a civil contempt proceeding for failing to pay child support and property equalization payments.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sarpy County, N.Y., alleges that, on March 22, 2010, Wallace was found in contempt of a court order that ordered him to pay $3,005 per month in child support, $552,124.89 in attorney fees, and a $600,000 civil penalty. The complaint also alleges that on January 6, 2017, the court found Wallace in willful contempt of the court and issued an order requiring him to comply with the court\u2019s order. The court also found that Wallace had failed to make the child support payments required under the decree of dissolution. The SEC alleges that the court had not yet ruled on the matter and that Wallace failed to respond to the complaint. In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2011 and 2012, Wallace filed a complaint for contempt of court against a district court for the dissolution of his marriage to Michelle A.

In a related matter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order against Wallace, freezing his assets, and ordering a temporary restraining order against him from further violations of the federal securities laws. The order also prohibits Wallace from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including in connection with the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order, and prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company or association with an SEC-registered broker-dealer. In its order for Wallace to be held in contempt, it also ordered that he pay a civil penalty of $500,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement and prejudgment interest that he has already paid in the contempt action, as well as a $50,000 attorney fee. Wallace has also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"). The court granted Wallace the right to a preliminary injunction and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from"
