  "summary": "On March 6, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Travis Higgins, an independent engineer employed by Engineering Partners International, L.L.C., and Jeffery D. Wells, an engineer consultant employed by a subcontractor of Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, who had a contract with the defendant for construction work to be completed at the company's Geismar, Louisiana facility.  According to the court's order, Higgins and Wells were employed by MMR Group, Inc., an engineering consulting firm, when the chemical explosion occurred on June 13, 2013.  The court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Higgins from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In addition, the court granted Higgins' motion for summary judgment on May 24, 2016, and granted the defendants a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendants' assets, and ordering them to pay civil penalties.  On June 5, 2014, the trial court issued a judgment recognizing that the defendant was the statutory employer of the plaintiffs pursuant to the Louisiana Workers' Compensation Act, and granting the defendants the right to summary judgment as a matter of law.  As part of the judgment, Higgins also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his or her pay.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Higgins, Wells, and Higgins consented to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of any penny stock in the public company that is registered to sell or offer a penny stock to the public.  Higgins agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 17(b)(2)(A) and (B).  The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2019-0049.    The SEC's investigation was conducted by Scott A. Mascianica and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Mancianica."
