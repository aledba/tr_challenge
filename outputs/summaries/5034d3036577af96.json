The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that Specialty failed to adequately treat a patient who suffered a severe pressure ulcer.  According to the complaint, after suffering paralysis during an aortic-related operation at Shands Teaching Hospital and Clinics, Inc., Mr. Barth was transferred to Select Specialty, where he suffered a deep-tissue pressure sore.
