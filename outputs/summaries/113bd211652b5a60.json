  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against Dollar General Corporation (\"Dollar General\"), Dollar General's parent company, Dollar General, and its subsidiary, Dolgencorp, LLC d/b/a Dollar General Store #11775, for defrauding an employee out of $500,000.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Mize, Mississippi, alleges that on or about May 28, 2015, Rebecca Keyes was an employee of Dollar General when she performed a cash reload to a money network card. According to the complaint, Keyes informed her manager of the problem and placed the receipt on the office desk. The complaint alleges that Keyes did not believe the problem was caused by a register error, and that Dollar General had waived its right to arbitrate by filing a criminal complaint against her.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Keyes. The SEC also announced that it had obtained a court order halting Dollar General from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Dollar General to pay a civil penalty of $1,500.  Dollar General agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in Keyes's complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On November 5, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action and obtained a temporary restraining order, which temporarily enjoins Keyes from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders her to submit to arbitration any claims that arise out of her employment or termination of employment with Dollar General. The court also issued an order freezing Keyes' assets, freezing her assets, and appointing a receiver to oversee her case.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for Dec. 7, 2016.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
