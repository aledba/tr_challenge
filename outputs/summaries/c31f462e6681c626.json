  "summary": "On May 18, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Quovadis Green, a security guard who was convicted of two counts of unlawful use of a gun in public places.  The court found that Green violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  According to the court's order, Green agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, which was filed in federal court in Chicago, by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws.  Green also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Green arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On May 24, 2019, the court granted Green's motion for a preliminary injunction, entered a temporary restraining order, and issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Audra D. Burch and Patricia Mazzei of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Jennifer L. Truman. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Missouri Department of State's Office of Criminal Investigations, the United States Postal Inspection Service and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services.
