  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a parental rights proceeding against her.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Vanessa C. S. Haddad (\"R.S.\") failed to adequately disclose to her trial counsel that she had a history of substance abuse and mental health issues that had not been adequately addressed by the court. The complaint further alleges that she was provided ineffective assistance in eliciting evidence of R.S.'s repeated, false allegations and concerns about her treatment of her children, and that she did not participate in the preparation of the final judgment. The SEC also alleges that the defendant failed to inform her counsel of her obligations under Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and failed to respond to her counsel's repeated requests for her to withdraw from the proceeding.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against S.H. and Ms. H. for their roles in the alleged misconduct.  On May 24, 2016, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendant to surrender her passport. The court's order, which is subject to court approval, prohibits the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and orders her to comply with the entry of a final judgement that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the securities laws, and requires her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to a judgment that permanently restrains her right to participate in a proceeding to terminate her parental rights. The judgment also prohibits her from acting as an unregistered broker or representative of a public company, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock at any time. The final judgment also bars her from associating with any broker, representative, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, or nationally recognized statistical statistical rating organization. The order also prohibits defendants from participating as brokers or offering penny stock, and bars defendants from serving as unregistered brokers and offering penny stocks. In addition, the order requires defendants to show cause and effect before the court to determine whether to consent to the termination of their parental rights, including by providing a copy of the complaint to the SEC. The Court also ordered the defendants to surrender their passport and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty."
