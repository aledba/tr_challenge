  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland today entered a final judgment in favor of Mona Pinner, a Maryland resident, in a civil injunctive action brought by her husband and stepson, alleging that Mona violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Mona and her husband, Randy Pinner of Charlotte, North Carolina, filed a settled civil action in which they were ordered to pay $99,856.84 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David P. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Maryland Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Maryland Office of Inspector General in this matter.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mona.  Mona has agreed to settle the SEC charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and bars her from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 3, 2019, the court entered an order granting the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordering Mona to comply with the court's order, ordering her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains plus interest and pay civil penalties of $10,000 and $1,500, respectively. Mona agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The court also granted the SEC the right to request a preliminary injunction, to hold a hearing on the merits of the matter, and to appoint a receiver for Mona in the future. In a separate administrative proceeding, the Court of Special Appeals issued an order suspending Mona from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The Court also ordered Mona's attorney to provide a copy of the SEC complaint filed in the SEC against her.  A hearing on May 4, 2019 was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. Eastern. The hearing was adjourned until May 21, 2019 to consider whether Mona had sufficient contacts with the SEC to determine whether she had sufficient jurisdiction to proceed with the litigation. The case was supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley, Chief of the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations."
