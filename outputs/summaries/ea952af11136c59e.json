  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Memphis, Tennessee man accused of orchestrating an aggravated kidnapping.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Memphis, Michael Lewis pled guilty without a plea agreement to a felony charge and was sentenced to 110 months in prison.  The SEC alleges that Lewis sought to withdraw his guilty plea without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and instead sought to have his attorney withdraw his plea at an earlier sentencing hearing. The complaint alleges that, at the time he pled guilty, Lewis was pleading guilty to possession of a firearm in connection with a felony offense and not to possessing it on June 22, the date of the kidnapping. The SEC further alleges that in 2016, when trying to be appointed new counsel and after participating in the March 2018 sentencing hearing, Lewis indicated that he would rather go to trial. The court denied his motion and, after another motion from Lewis, determined that the cross-reference did not apply to him and that Lewis should be able to withdraw from the plea and be eligible for a full reduction for acceptance of responsibility.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for New Jersey today announced that it has filed a criminal case against Lewis. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division in the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Gibson, and the case will be supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.N. Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the FBI, and other relevant authorities."
