  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of Steven Schoenfeld, who died on August 21, 2015.  The court found that the estate had the capacity to pay a civil penalty of $614,300, or $1,228,600, when it filed a complaint in the name of the deceased defendant.  According to the court's order, filed on October 24, 2017, Schoenfield's estate filed an amended complaint in which it alleged that the Estate had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 15(b)(2) thereunder, and that it had the right to determine whether the civil penalty should be imposed upon the estate.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the amended complaint, the Estate consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Estate from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of any civil penalty imposed.  In addition, the court granted the Estate's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  On November 9, 2015, the Court granted the estate's motion for a preliminary injunction, entered a default judgment, and ordered the Estate to pay civil penalties of $690,188.71, $1.4 million, and $1 million, respectively, to the Estate, which was previously charged by the Court with a similar action.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael R. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry.
