  "summary": "On February 22, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia entered a temporary restraining order against Robert W. Dervishian, Jr., a Virginia resident who was injured while working as an Operations Manager for a tugboat owned by Vulcan Construction Materials, LLC.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charles City, Va., Dervishedian was injured on February 22 while performing maintenance on the Jeanie Clay tugboat at Shirley Plantation Dock.  The complaint alleges that Dervishingian, who was not a seaman nor an employee of Vulcan, suffered multiple, severe injuries, including left leg fractures requiring amputation of his left leg.  Dervishesian also was injured when a letter from Vulcan's registered agent, Kim Todd, was hand-delivered to a registered agent.  As alleged in the complaint, the note did not indicate that the tugboat owner was liable for the alleged negligence of the employee, and instead, it stated that the employee \"caused the J-clamp tugboat to impact the port side of the vessel.\"  The SEC alleges that the note, which was signed by a Vulcan employee, was a \"cryptic and vague note\" that set a tone of ambiguity and vagueness that would put a vessel owner on notice of a limitation of liability.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Dervistian.

Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the court also ordered the company to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty, which is equal to the amount of any civil penalty that would be imposed by the court at the time of filing a limitation action.   The court also granted the company's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as an officer-and-director bar and a penny stock bar, and to pay an officer and director bar.  Additionally, the Court granted the companies' motion for preliminary and permanent injunctions against further violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  In a related administrative proceeding, the federal district court"
