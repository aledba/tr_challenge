  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Brian Scott Reid, Jr., a Utah man who was convicted of three felony counts of rape, forcible sodomy, and forcible sexual abuse.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Reid was falsely told that he had a consensual sexual encounter with a woman at a motel on May 28, 2015.  According to the complaint, Reid told his wife that, on the date of the alleged sexual assault, he had grabbed her by the pussy and held her down while he \"touched her vagina.\"  The complaint further alleges that, during closing arguments, Reid admitted to having consensual sexual intercourse with K.R., but denied having any physical contact with the woman.  In addition, Reid claimed that he never touched her vagina, that he did not remember what happened on the day of the assault, and that his DNA was found not just on the vulvar swabs but inside the vagina.  As alleged, Reid also claimed that, the first time he met his wife, she had asked him about the alleged assault and he had told her about it.  Reid also allegedly told her that, in her initial police report, the defendant had invited her into her room to watch a movie and had had sex with her the day before, but had not had any sexual contact with her that day.  He also allegedly used lotion to lubricate his penis, which he later admitted to his wife.    In a parallel action, the Utah Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Reid, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charging Reid with aiding and abetting those violations.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Reid consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Ostrove and Eric R. Werner of the Salt Lake Regional Office, with the assistance of the Utah Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Office of Public Health and Health Education and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Timothy J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Scott A. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the U. S. Attorney's Office for Utah and the Utah Department of Health and Human Services."
