  "summary": "On January 31, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Airbnb for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges Airbnb with violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b2-3 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  According to the complaint, Airbnb has agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In its amended complaint, the complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 5, Airbnb violated the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Exchange Act Rule 5(b)(5) and (c) thereunder and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  It also alleges that by not following the required registration provisions, Airbnb is violating Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 15a-3, and that it is liable for a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $20,000, which is equal to the amount that Airbnb has already paid to a broker.  Additionally, the proposed settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1548 (Aug. 9, 2016).  The complaint also seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions against future violations of Section 13(d) and 14d-1 of Exchange Rule 13d-2 thereunder; and a conduct-based injunction against further violations of Rule 12b-1.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, and the case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in this matter."
