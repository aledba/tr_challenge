  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against defendant Wynton Collins, Jr., who was found guilty of second-degree murder for the July 8, 2013, shooting death of Georgina Randall.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on the night of the shooting, defendant told a woman he met on the porch that he was going to meet her at a restaurant.  According to the complaint, Randall allegedly told her that he had a gun and that he would shoot her if she would just \"hold on.\"  The complaint further alleges that defendant told the woman that he shot Randall because he \"got it. She think [sic] I'm playing.\"  Randall allegedly replied that he did not know what was about to happen and that the woman was having a problem with her vehicle.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the court found that defendant had failed to establish the mitigating factor of provocation by a preponderance of the evidence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against defendant.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge William G. Donnelly of the U.N. Division of Justice issued a temporary restraining order against defendant and ordered him to surrender his passport.  Donnelly also issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney and ordering him to provide a copy of the Complaint to the court.   The court also ordered the SEC to conduct a parallel criminal investigation, which is ongoing, with the assistance of the FBI's Chicago Field Office and the Chicago Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov free and simple search tool.
