  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment against Levi G. Gibbs III, a convicted felon who was sentenced to fifty years in prison for his role in the September 3, 2017, shooting death of Shane Wessels in Fort Dodge, Iowa. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Des Moines, Iowa, Gibbs was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 704.2B of the Iowa Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint alleges that, in September 2017, Gibbs shot and killed Wesselss, who was standing shirtless, unarmed, and backing away from the scene when confronted by a member of the Ku Klux Klan. The SEC alleges that Gibbs failed to disclose that he had fired a gun, and that he did not have a gun at the time of the shooting. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Gibbs.  The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Gibbs, charging him with a felony for failing to comply with a federal law requiring him to disclose his or her use of deadly force.  In its complaint, the SEC also charged Gibbs with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Gibbs consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Aug. 24, 2018).  In a related matter, the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced parallel criminal prosecutions against Gibbs and related defendants.
