  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a wrongful discharge action brought by Julie M. Sowell, a former employee of Southbury-Middlebury Youth and Family Services, Inc. (Youth Services), for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that the defendants improperly concluded that Sowell had violated rule 4.2 of the Rules of Professional Conduct when, at a hearing held on December 12, 2013, the court granted the defendants' motion for an emergency protective order on the basis of the court's finding that the defendant had violated the rules. The complaint further alleges that Judge Sheedy improperly found clear and convincing evidence that the plaintiff had violated Rule 4.3 and that his petition for certification to appeal from the judgment in Sowell v. DiCara was nonjusticiable because his speech was a reasonable remedial measure under rule 3.2. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, prejudgment interest of $2,037, and a civil penalty of $100,000. The judgment also prohibits the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with a settled administrative proceeding. The defendants also have agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the Connecticut Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Sowell for his role in the scheme. The SEC is continuing its investigation into the matter. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Department of Justice."
