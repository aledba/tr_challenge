  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against General Electric Co. (GE) and its affiliated companies for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, GE and the affiliated companies entered into a collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) in which they promised retirees lifetime healthcare benefits. The CBA provided that retirees who had retired before the CBA had the right to participate in a defined benefit plan (defined as a \"guaranteed health benefit\") that would be available to retirees when they reached the age of 65 and after they had retired. The complaint alleges that, contrary to these promises, the contracts did not provide for a guaranteed health benefit for retirees until the end of the contract. Rather, as alleged in the complaint, each CBA required the parties to provide for guaranteed health benefits for retirees at a time when the contract was in effect.  The complaint further alleges that the contracts expressly prohibited GE from requiring retirees to provide guaranteed health care benefits for life.  In addition, the complaint alleged that, in violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, GE failed to provide a reasonable explanation for why retirees should not be entitled to guaranteed healthcare benefits beyond the expiration of the contracts.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, GE has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and orders GE to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,500.  GE has also agreed to pay civil penalties of $4,850, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Ohio Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
