  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment in favor of Kentucky-based insurance companies and their affiliated entities in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky on September 25, 2015, alleges that Secura Insurance, LLC and F.A.O. Entertainment, LLC violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Secura has agreed to settle the SEC's action by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders Secura to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. Secura also agreed to pay $1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York today announced criminal charges against Secura.  According to the SEC, Secura and its affiliated entities filed a complaint in federal district court in Bowling Green, Kentucky, on June 9, 2009, charging Secura with violating the federal securities laws, and Secura agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the securities laws. The judgment also prohibits Secura from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, screening, or safety bar in any civil proceeding. The SEC also seeks a preliminary injunction, disgorging all of Secura's allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, and an officer-and-director bar.  Separately, the SEC announced that it has filed a civil action in the U.K. Division of Securities and Exchange Commission v. Travelers Indem. Co., Inc., 495 F.3d 763, 787 (6th Cir. 2004). The SEC is continuing its investigation into the matter, with the assistance of the Kentucky Department of Insurance's Office of Insurance Regulation and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kentucky Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Insurance Regulatory Surveillance Authority."
