  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Wendy Christine Williams, who was convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of the federal protective order.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Anchorage, Alaska, alleges that Williams violated the protective order by approaching or contacting Kathleen Lansdale and her husband, Robert Lansdale, while they were engaged in a bitter custody battle over their son Israel. According to the complaint, Williams also violated a court order that prohibited her from contacting the Lansdale family. Williams also was found liable for violating an order prohibiting her from approaching or communicating with anyone who was not a member of the family, including her son, Israel. Williams was also found liable by the court for violating a separate court order for violating the same protective order at the football jamboree. The SEC alleges that the court improperly allowed Williams to cross-examine certain of the other defendants in the case, and the court ultimately limited Williams\u2019s conviction to three of those prior incidents. Williams has also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the court order, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Alaska today announced criminal charges against Williams.  Williams has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction that prohibits him from approaching, watching, confronting, or otherwise stalking the Lansdales. The court also granted Williams the right to return a general verdict on the felony charges.  On August 26, 2013, the court granted Williams a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return to court on August 29, 2013. On August 30, 2014, Williams pleaded guilty to one count of felony possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. The jury deliberated for two hours before finding Williams guilty on August 31, 2014. Williams is awaiting sentencing on September 5, 2015.  As set forth in the complaint filed in the SEC, Williams is charged with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Advisers\") and Rules 206(3) and (4) thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being supervised"
