  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Michael B. Bernier, who was convicted of two counts of child molestation in 2014.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that Bernier violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the SEC's finding, Bernier was not liable for failing to consent to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Bernier. The SEC also announced that it would conduct a parallel criminal investigation against him.  According to the complaint, the SEC previously charged Bernier with violating Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 and Rule 15a-3 thereunder, and that the SEC has filed an emergency action to halt the alleged misconduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the court has issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 17-10-6.2 (c) (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Atlanta Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Atlanta Office of the Attorney General."
