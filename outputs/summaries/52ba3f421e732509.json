  "summary": "On March 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama entered a preliminary injunction against Cullman County Sheriff Matt Gentry and three other defendants for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Columbia, alleges that Gentry violated the due process provisions of the federal securities laws by imposing pre-arranged bail for indigent defendants who cannot afford to post bond.  According to the complaint, the defendants' bail schedule is inconsistent with the federal bail laws.  For example, the complaint alleges that the defendants did not provide sufficient evidence to support their claims that secured money bail is necessary for court appearance.  In addition, the SEC alleges that defendants who can afford secured bail do not qualify to be released on their own recognizance or on secured bonds.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Gentry consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions and orders him to pay a $1,500 civil penalty, a $20,000 officer-and-director bar, and a $10,000 bond. The final judgment also orders Gentry to pay $100,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Gentry has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future violations of the securities laws, and he will also be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Judge Turner has also agreed to an order appointing a receiver to oversee the release of defendants who are unable to afford secured money bonds. The court will determine the amount of bond that will be imposed upon each defendant based on his or her financial condition. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Department of Criminal Justice, and the Alabama Attorney General's Office in this matter."
