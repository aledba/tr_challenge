  "summary": "On February 7, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment in favor of a Texas-based company and its wholly-owned subsidiary in a civil injunctive action brought by the Texas Attorney General's Office.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that ProTradeNet, LLC and Predictive Profiles, Inc. violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's order, the defendants violated the federal securities laws by failing to comply with the agreed-upon provisions of the agreement.  In addition, the court found that, contrary to the representations made in the complaint, the Defendants violated the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $75,000, and ordering the Defendants to pay civil penalties of $25,000 and $10,500, respectively.  Additionally, the Court granted the Defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the Defendants, and ordered the defendants to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  On February 13, 2020, the Honorable Judge William H. Perillo of the United States District Court in Houston granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, entered an order appointing a receiver for the receivership of the receiver, and appointed a receiver to oversee the receiver's operations.

Rymas of the Fort Worth Regional Office and the Texas Office of Financial Regulation."
