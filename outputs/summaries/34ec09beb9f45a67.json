  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas on May 24, 2017 entered a final judgment in favor of the Texas Department of Revenue against EBS Solutions, Inc. (EBS), a Texas-based company that assessed franchise taxes for EBS in violation of Section 112 of the Tax Code. The court found that EBS violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered EBS to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of the assessed tax. EBS agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the findings of the court's order, and EBS filed a complaint with the court against the Commission. The complaint alleges that the Commission improperly imposed a pre-judgment injunction on EBS, which prohibited EBS from filing a tax complaint, and the Commission issued an order suspending the registration of EBS as a party to a tax assessment. The Commission also issued a temporary restraining order and an order freezing EBS's assets. The Court also denied EBS\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  The Commission issued its final judgment on May 25, 2017, ordering the Commission to consider the merits of the Commission's action.  In its order, the Commission agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from violating the prerequisites for filing a complaint, imposes a civil injunctive proceeding, and orders the Commission not to violate the preclearance provisions of Sections 112.051 and 112.101 of the Exchange Act. The order also prohibits the commission from issuing a subpoena or issuing an order requiring a court to issue an order appointing a receiver for a receiver of a receiver. In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed an emergency action to halt EBS' litigation. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Scott A. Birkenheier. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The Office of Compliance and Regulatory Affairs appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
