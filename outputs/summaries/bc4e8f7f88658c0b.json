  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against defendant Brian Douglas Horn for the second-degree murder of 12-year-old Justin Bloxom.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in DeSoto Parish, Louisiana, on March 29, 2010, defendant Brian Horn agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 14b-5 thereunder.  The SEC alleges that, in a parallel criminal case, Horn was charged with the same conduct in which he was convicted.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Horn.  On March 31, 2011, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Horn, charging him with second- and third-degree felony murder, and ordering him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Horn consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Sections 14(e)(1) and 14(b)(5)(A) and 17(a)(2)(B) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Section 10(b) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 12b2-2, and 12b3-3 thereunder, and requiring him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years.  Additionally, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order against defendants from further violating the charged provisions of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-11, 12a-13, and 14a-14 thereunder and ordered him to surrender his right to counsel, which includes the right to a jury trial, to show cause and effect, and to consent to the appointment of a receiver to determine the appropriate amount of restitution to be paid to the receiver.  Further, the complaint alleges that defendant's brother, Kevin Horn, aided and abetted his brother's and Kevin Horn's violations of Section 15(e) and 15e-3 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Advisers\").  The complaint further alleges that during the pre-trial stage of the case, defendant's wife and another adult woman told the defendant that he had \"broke out of gas\" and suggested that a \"younger\" man join them in sexual activities.  During the trial, defendant filed a motion for an injunction against further violations of Sections 14"
