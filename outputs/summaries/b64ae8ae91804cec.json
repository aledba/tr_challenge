  "summary": "On March 1, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against Scott Van Dyke, the majority owner and president of Anglo-Dutch Petroleum International, Inc., a company that had sued Halliburton Energy Services, Inc. and another company.  According to the court's order, in 2000, the defendants entered into contracts with others to invest in a $1.7 million oil and gas project that was subject to a court-ordered turnover.  The court found that the defendants had no discretion to determine the substantive rights of the parties in a turnover proceeding, and therefore did not have the power to determine whether the parties had substantive rights to the funds.  In addition, as alleged in the court order, the court did not deem the defendants' claims of ownership credible, and the defendants did not deposit any funds into the court registry at any time as a matter of fact and law.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the parties consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the parties.   The SEC's order also prohibits the defendants from acting as unregistered broker-dealers or third parties in turnover proceedings. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Houston Regional Office by John R. Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner.
