  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Mexico announced today that it has obtained an emergency court order halting a New Mexico hunting license revocation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that the Arizona Department of Game and Fish issued a temporary restraining order and issued a cease-and-desist order on an individual who submitted an application for a hunting, fishing, trapping and guide license.  According to the complaint, the suspension order was based on substantial evidence and abuse of discretion by the Arizona Commission on which it relied to deny Respondent a license to hunt, fish, trap and guide in New Mexico.  In its order, the Commission found that Respondent violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17-2A-3(C) of the federal hunting and fishing licensing laws.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Respondent consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and prohibits him from serving as a registered hunting guide or outfitter in any state for five years and subsequently restores his privileges by granting him a new license.\u00c2\u00a0 The Commission's order also requires Respondent to complete a hunter education course and provide proof before applying for a new hunting permit.    The Commission also issued an order suspending Respondent from participating in any hunting, trapping, or guide activities in the state for a period of five years. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's order, which was obtained by the New Mexico Secretary of State's Office, is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder.  This case is being handled by John Rymas of the SEC's New Mexico Division of Enforcement, with assistance from Eric R. Werner of the Division of Fish and Wildlife's Office of Enforcement's Analysis and Detection Center."
