  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Stacey G. Kubyn and R. Russell Kubyn in a civil injunctive action brought by the Kubyns.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 14, 2018 in the United States District Court in Ohio, Follett, a Canadian citizen, and her Canadian husband, R.Russell Kubyn, raised the issue of whether a court should exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 230 of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that Follett has engaged in a pattern of conduct that includes, but not limited to, posting on Facebook her desire for the death of Stacey Kubyn on various websites devoted to automobile racing equipment and related subjects, and requesting other people to post that they too wished death to befall her.  Follett also allegedly used social media to wage a defamatory campaign, including on behalf of her husband, using the names of Ohio incorporated dog clubs to direct people to her own website.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Follett.  On January 17, 2019, the court granted the attorney general's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 2307.382(A)(6) and (B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder, and ordering Follett to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, prejudgment interest of $2,038.71 and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Janssen and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Department of Insurance."
