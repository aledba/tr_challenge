  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of South Carolina today entered a final judgment against a South Carolina man who was charged with insider trading in connection with an ongoing criminal case.  According to the SEC's complaint, on February 20, 2011, Eddie Williams was relaxing in his home when he heard a car pull into his driveway. The complaint alleges that Williams, who was on trial for second-degree burglary, and his brother, Reginald Felder, entered into the home together the night before the alleged crime, and the three intruders ran away.  The complaint further alleges that Robinson's prior convictions were not admissible under Rule 609(a)(1) of the federal securities laws, and that Williams' prior felony convictions were improperly admitted.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Robinson.  Williams has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, which will be offset by a civil penalty of $5,000.  Robinson has also agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and ordered to pay a $1,500 civil penalty.  On March 21, 2017, the court of appeals issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order against Robinson, ordering him to surrender his passport, and requiring him to provide a copy of the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Williams consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws. The court also ordered Robinson to comply with the bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, or any other jurisdiction where he has a prior conviction for a felony or theft, and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Atlanta Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Professional and Risk Analysis in this matter."
