  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the grandmother of a child who was allegedly molested by her husband and father.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on August 14, 2018, the grandmother and her husband, J.L. (hereinafter sometimes referred to as \"the father\"), violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that the grandmother was not able to adequately care for the child because she had been incarcerated for child endangerment in 1995 and had been convicted of child abuse in 1995.  According to the complaint, in denying the grandmother's custody petition, the judge ordered the grandmother to be placed in the home of the grandmother under the direct supervision of the mother and the father, and that, therefore, she should be in the custody of the child.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against both grandmother and father, charging them with violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, W.N. consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from future violations, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 12b2-2, and 12b3-3 thereunder, and bars her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including the right to reapply as a judge upon motion of the court upon request of the SEC. The court granted the grandmother a temporary restraining order and ordered her to comply with the court's order.  A hearing scheduled for September 10, 2018 is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. Eastern. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Department of Child and Family Services in this matter."
