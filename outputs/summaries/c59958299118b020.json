  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for failing to timely respond to a request for documents related to a disabled veteran's request to review his vocational rehabilitation case file.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 22, 2016, the VA failed to respond to Mr. Alford's third FOIA request.  The complaint alleges that, over the course of a three-month period, the agency failed to provide a reasonable explanation for why it did not respond to the VA's July 14, 2016 request for a copy of the CVINRS file. The complaint further alleges that the VA did not adequately search its electronic database for any responsive documents, and that, in fact, it failed to produce any IWRPs.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the agency from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the agency to pay $400,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the agency's civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced criminal charges against Alford arising from the same conduct.  On May 24, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint against the VA for its non-compliance with its July 2016 discovery order. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Welshhans and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of the Inspector General in this matter."
