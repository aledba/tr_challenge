  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Nebraska announced today that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing child custody proceeding.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in 2009, Anicette C. Tsevi of Nebraska filed a complaint in federal court in Togo, Guinea, alleging that she and her husband, C.D., had a significant connection to Togo.  According to the complaint, in 2006, when the court entered a final judgment granting Togo jurisdiction over the child custody proceedings, it found that Togo had no jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination, and that the court had jurisdiction to determine the child\u2019s care, protection, and personal relationships.  In 2011, the court issued an order in June 2012 granting custody to the child to Kwami, without subject matter jurisdiction.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, this order did not apply to all of the parties involved in the custody proceeding, and the court did not have jurisdiction to issue an initial custody determination.  Instead, the SEC alleges that the parties litigated this case in the district court for some time and, upon its correct determination that it never had jurisdiction under the federal child custody provisions of the federal law, it vacated all prior custody orders.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against them.  Finally, the Court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order against the defendants, which is subject to court approval, and granted the court's motion for a new trial.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Kathleen A. Bentsen of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted the Court's request for an emergency order halting the pending litigation.  A hearing on August 4, 2018 was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.N. Secret Service, the Swiss Federal Office of Children and Family Affairs, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, the Canadian Securities and Exchange Commission, the British Columbia Securities and Investments Commission and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority."
