The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, alleges that New Jersey and the MEGA violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Section 23 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") was preempted by the enactment of Chapter 78.  According to the complaint, the City and the Association did not have the authority to impose a progressive rate structure on retirees, but instead to assume a portion of the costs of health care coverage for certain eligible retirees.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the city and the association failed to provide sufficient discretion in setting contribution rates for eligible retirees under Section 23.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Section 23 and orders them to pay a percentage of the cost of their health care benefits, including any future cost of living adjustments that may be required by the employer or through a collective negotiations agreement for such coverage.  Additionally, the court granted the Association's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against future violations of Section 23, as well as other emergency relief.  On June 17, 2016, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in New Jersey alleging violations of the antifraud provisions of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(3) of Exchange Act Rules 17a-14(a) and (c) thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the defendants.  Separately, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against two municipal employees for their roles in connection with the alleged scheme.  Among other things, the Attorney General's Office has issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to proceed with a criminal case against the three municipal employees charged in the complaint.  A hearing on the matter has been scheduled for July 24, 2018, for which the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and Glenn S. Gordon of the Philadelphia Regional Office, with assistance from Joseph C. Sansone of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The case is being supervised by"
