  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Connecticut yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the city of Hartford, ordering the city to pay $3.22 million in interest and a $1.9 million civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut, alleges that the city improperly valued the property on the basis of an unreasonable assumption that the property would be assembled with adjoining properties for commercial development.  According to the complaint, the city's valuation of the property was based on a valuation that did not reflect the true market value of the properties.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, from the outset of the purchase, Yeatman had viewed the property as a separate entity from the downtown area.  As a result, he had developed large projects across the country similar in scale and type to DoNo's proposal.  For example, in 2010, the court found the property worth $1,900,000 and $2,010,000, respectively, when the city purchased the property for $2.5 million in advance of the ballpark announcement.  However, as alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants' valuation was not reasonable because the city did not have sufficient evidence to determine whether assemblage would have occurred in the absence of condemnation.  Instead, the SEC alleges that Yeatmann failed to adequately represent to the court that he had both the expertise and the means to assemble and develop the property.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's Judgment, Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay interest at a rate that is reasonable and just on the amount of the compensation.  Defendants also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1 million, which is equal to disgorgement plus prejudgment interest of $3 million, and to be subject to a penny stock bar.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Kathleen M. Burns of the United States District Court in Hartford entered a judgment against the defendants that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Among other things, the judgment also prohibits the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, offer, or sale of any real estate without prior approval from the court.   The settlement is pending final approval by the Court."
