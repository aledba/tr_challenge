  "summary": "On Jan. 1, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against defendants Allstate Corp., Allstate Indemnity Company, Allstate Property and Casualty Company, and Allstate Fire & Casualty Co.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Allstate violated the filed rate doctrine, which prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive practices by insurance companies.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that since 2012, allstate has considered its policyholders' willingness to tolerate premium increases as a factor in calculating auto insurance rates. The complaint further alleges that, since 2012 Allstate began charging its longtime policyholders higher premiums than it charged new customers who presented the same risk but were less willing to tolerate a price increase.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Allstate for its alleged violations of the charged rate doctrine and the primary jurisdiction provision of the federal securities laws.  Allstate agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  On Jan. 2, 2017, the Honorable Judge David C. Mascianica of the Illinois Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering Allstate to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The court also issued an order suspending proceedings against the defendants in connection with the pending litigation.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-423 (January 26, 2017).  The complaint also names Allstate as a defendant in a civil action brought by the Illinois Department of Insurance, which has jurisdiction over the agency's rate determination and enforcement. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
