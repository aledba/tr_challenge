  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York today entered a final judgment against VisionPro Communications Corp., a New York-based telecommunications company, and its owners, Kevin Silvar and Joseph P. Romano, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's order, filed on August 6, 2010, and unsealed on September 13, 2011, the date of the final approval of the settlement, VisionPro, Silvar, and Romano agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains the parties' exclusive and continuing jurisdiction over the class action.  The final judgments also require the parties to pay in the aggregate $28,761.87 to satisfy two former employees' State wage claims, inclusive of civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the final judgments, which, in effect, permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $2,990.59, a 100% civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlements are subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against two former VisionPro employees. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges VisionPro and Silvar with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"), and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The complaint also names as a relief defendant the Commissioner of Labor's Office of Inspector General, the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and the Department of Justice's Retail Strategy Task Force as relief defendants. The Division of Enforcement's complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations. The Commission has agreed to a settlement that is subject to approval by the court. The settlement is pending final approval by a court that is not bound by the Commission's order. The litigation will be led by Eric Springer and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the New York Regional Office. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
