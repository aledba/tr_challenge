  "summary": "On March 20, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a temporary restraining order against Sutherland/Palumbo, LLC, a Texas-based real estate company, and four other defendants in an emergency motion to dismiss their claims under the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, alleges that Sutherland and Palumbo violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Sutherland, Palumbo, and the other defendants failed to adequately disclose to the court that they were involved in a real estate transaction that left their client holding the bag on $8 million of rent over a 25-year period.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants violated the mandatory discovery provision of Section 27.006 of the TCPA, which requires defendants to show reasonable cause why they should not be subject to discovery.  For example, as alleged, Sutherland served Defendants with a bevy of written discovery requests, many of which were not specific to the allegations at issue in the complaint.  As alleged, the defendants had the vast majority of the information in their possession because it was things that at least we argue should be included in the discovery order.  Sutherland also failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in issuing the Discovery Order and ordering him to respond to the discovery requests prior to the hearing on the motion.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Sutherland consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $5,000.  Additionally, Sutherland agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, from participating in any offering of securities, and to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty in the amount of $100,000, which will be determined by the court at a later date.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Sutherland"
