  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Sportsmark Trading, Ltd. (\"Sportsmark\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 340.6 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Sportsmark filed a malicious prosecution action in violation of the federal securities laws on April 26, 2010.  The complaint alleges that Sportsmark, through its principal, Ronald E. Mallen, Jr., and its attorneys, Marc C. Loeb, and Ralph C. McCloskey, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to obtain a temporary restraining order preventing Sportsmark from violating the securities laws.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendants failed to disclose to the court that they had violated the securities registration provisions of Sections 340.5 and (3) and (4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  In addition, the SEC alleges that the defendants did not adequately disclose to SEC staff that they were liable for liability arising from their participation in the litigation.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against SportsMark.  On May 24, 2011, the U. S. District Judge in Manhattan entered a judgment ordering the defendants to pay $47,036.45 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions and orders them to pay civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits, and bars them from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Sportsmark also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $50,000, and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any security, including the right to reapply as an attorney after five years of serving as a judge.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 24, 2010).
