  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alaska yesterday entered a final judgment against Cook Inlet Natural Gas Storage Alaska, LLC, a private company building a natural gas storage facility on the Kenai Peninsula.  The court found that the company had no right to compensation for the use of the gas in its possession.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Anchorage, Alaska, CINGSA claimed that it had the right to use, free of cost, gas in the form of \"base gas\" in the Sterling C Reservoir, and that it was entitled to compensation based on the percentage of gas remaining in the reservoir.  However, the complaint alleges that the court did not consider the value of the stock in question, and instead relied on the valuation methodology of one of the experts who testified at trial.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company.   The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Kenai Landing, alleging that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, CingSA consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $88,677, which is equal to the amount of compensation that it received from the sale of its stock in the stock.  Additionally, the court granted the company a temporary restraining order, which prohibits it from issuing or selling any security or other security-related documents, and ordered the company to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  On May 9, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action against CING SA, charging the company with violations of Section 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(3) of Securities Act Section 13(a) and Rule 17a-1 thereunder. The SEC is continuing its investigation into the matter, and the matter is being handled by the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit and the Alaska Division of Natural Resources. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
