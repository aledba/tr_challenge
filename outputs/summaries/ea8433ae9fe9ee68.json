  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of South Dakota today entered a final judgment against a South Dakota man for his alleged role in the alleged alienation of affections.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that Jerry Cedar violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Cedar and his wife, Leslie Cedar, were married in Kansas in 2000 when Cedar and Leslie began an online relationship over Facebook. The complaint alleges that Cedar had no romantic interest in Leslie, but began to develop romantic feelings for her in the fall of 2015. Cedar also allegedly had a sexual relationship with another man, Archibald \"Junior\" Linthorne for approximately two weeks in September 2015.  Cedar and Cedar both testified that their relationship did not become romantic until late September 2015 when they had sexual relations once in Johnson\u2019s restaurant office and once at his home and once in an abandoned farmhouse in Frederick.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for the Northern District of S.D. today announced criminal charges against Cedar arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint. The SEC also charged Cedar with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against Cedar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Cedar has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 22, 2018).
