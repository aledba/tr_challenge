  "summary": "On October 10, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against Brett Dolfi, Sr., a former husband and wife who filed for bankruptcy on November 20, 2017.  The court found that the Amended Complaint, filed under Section 5 of the Bankruptcy Code, was untimely and must be dismissed.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on February 19, 2018, filed in federal district court in New Jersey, Brett and Debtor were former spouses who entered into a promissory note in February 2014 to enable them to purchase a vehicle around that same time. The complaint alleges that Debtor knew that, upon execution of the Property Agreement in 2015, the debt owed to Plaintiff Brian would be due in full by April 2017. In addition, the Complaint alleges that, in 2014, Debtor sold or traded-in the vehicle with the intent of ceasing payments to plaintiff Brian. The SEC alleges that the amended Complaint violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Court also found that, contrary to the representations in the complaint, neither Debtor nor Debtor agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the provisions of the federal securities laws. The court also ruled that, without admitting or denying the allegations in the amended complaint, there is no reasonable basis for a finding of non-dischargeability of the debt.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against Debtor.  On December 21, the SEC filed an amended complaint against Brett, alleging that he violated Section 15(c)(1)(A) and (a)(15) and that he aided and abetted Debtor's violations of Section 15 (c)(2)(A). The SEC also charged Debtor with aiding and abetting her violations of Rule 15(a)(2) and 13(b)(5) thereunder, as well as for her failure to comply with Rule 15a-5 and (15) in connection with her receipt of the loan from Brian in 2014. The Complaint also alleges that she violated Rule 15A-5 by failing to timely file a complaint with the SEC with the purpose of recovering the allegedly ill-gotten gains from the alleged misconduct.  Finally, the complaint charged Brian with violating Rule 15b2-A, and with violating Section 10b(b).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael R. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Salazar"
