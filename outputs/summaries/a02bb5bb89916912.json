  "summary": "On January 17, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia entered a final judgment against Fairfax County, Va., that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 15(b) of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $15,2-2307.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Fairfax, Virginia, alleges that the defendants violated the federal anti-fraud laws by failing to comply with certain of the provisions of Sections 15(a), 15(c), and 15(d)(ii) of federal law.  According to the complaint, the defendants were in violation of the pre-clearance provisions of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Section 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(3) of Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating these provisions, ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $150,000, and ordering the Cohns to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $20,000.  In a parallel action, the Virginia Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued an order suspending the Defendants from appearing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review that was conducted by the Office of Inspections and Examinations' Market Abuse Unit, with the assistance of the Virginia Department of Commerce's Office of Inspector General, and the Fairfax County Board of Zoning Appeals.   The complaint further alleges that, in its opinion, the Court found that the Defendants violated Section 15.2 of the Securities Act, and ordered the Defendants to pay an $8,500 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  Additionally, the court found that, contrary to the Defendants\u2019 representations, Code \u00a715.2-229(D) is not sufficient to prevent Fairfax County from requiring the Defendants cease their illegal use of the structures as dwelling units and to remove the kitchens and other accoutrements that support the defendants\u2019 use of those structures as dwellings.  On August 4, 2016, the Judge granted the Defendants a temporary restraining order against further violations of the above-mentioned provisions, and issued a permanent injunction against the Defendants, ordering them to return to the property and pay a $10,000 civil penalty in the amount of $1,100,000"
