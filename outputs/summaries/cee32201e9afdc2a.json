  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Benjamin Serico, a New Jersey resident who lost his life to colon cancer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlantic City, N.J., alleges that Serico served Rothberg with an offer of judgment for $750,000 without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. According to the complaint, Serico entered into a settlement agreement with Rothberg in October 2015 that limited the amount she could recover at trial to $1,000,000. The settlement also included a provision that prohibited Serico from seeking additional litigation expenses, including attorney's fees and counsel fees. The complaint alleges that the settlement was not intended to avoid litigation expenses or save time, and Serico did not express her intention to pursue those expenses during negotiations. The court entered judgment in the amount of $6,500,000 as required by Rule 4:58, and the settlement through high-low agreement was not subject to the rules of contract interpretation by the court. Serico's motion for a preliminary injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Serico violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert on the subject of this matter, warning investors to be aware of any potential conflicts of interest arising out of a settlement offer. Investors should be aware that the SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions to quickly and easily identify whether investments in a particular investment are subject to SEC approval.  For example, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission."
