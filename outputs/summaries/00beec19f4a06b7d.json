  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jamaal Brooks, a recidivist defendant who was sentenced to a lifetime of supervised release.  The court found that Brooks violated the terms of his supervised release by failing to report for scheduled drug testing.  According to the court's order, filed on June 3, 2013, Brooks was released from prison on January 16, 2014, after serving a five-year supervised release for a drug trafficking offense.  Brooks continued to test positive for marijuana and had previously been sentenced to lifetime supervised release in violation of the supervised release provisions of the federal securities laws.  As alleged in the court order, Brooks had not been able to muster the strength of character to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the opportunity presented to him.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Brooks, charging him with violating the supervised releases provisions of federal law and ordering him to pay a penalty of up to 30 months' imprisonment followed by a mandatory minimum of three years' supervised release upon revocation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Brooks consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the mandatory minimum and orders him to repay the restitution with interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from participating in supervised release programs.  On May 13, 2015, the court granted the court a temporary restraining order and ordered Brooks to return to the institution of his release, and ordered him to comply with the order.  At a hearing on June 29, 2016, Judge Burden granted the Court's request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered the court to consider the merits of Brooks's case.   The Court also ordered the probation department to conduct an independent review of the issues raised by the court in the order, which included the issue of whether to revoke the defendant's supervised release and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.  A hearing scheduled for July 19, 2016 was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. for Brooks to determine whether to impose a life term of supervised releases.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 24, 2014).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Fraud Task Force\u00c2\u00a0to detect and detect potential violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The Commission's investigation, which is continuing,"
