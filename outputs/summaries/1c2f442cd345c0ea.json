  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former state agency physician who was found incompetent to perform work due to a combination of physical and mental impairments.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against her from further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's order, filed on March 8, 2018, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that Dr. Laurel Verant, a licensed social worker at the time of her appointment with the ALJ, failed to properly evaluate and weigh the medical evidence and the treating medical providers' findings.  In addition, the court found that Verant failed to consider that Plaintiff had a history of severe physical impairments, had suffered multiple shoulder surgeries, and had suffered from severe post-traumatic stress disorder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Verant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On March 9, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint against Verant and her treating physician, alleging that she violated Rule 5a-14 thereunder, and that she aided and abetted Verant's violations of Rule 5b2-1.  Verant agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction, which is subject to court approval.  She also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17.   The SEC's complaint charges Verant with violating Section 17-a-1 of the\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act and Rule 13a-3 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against her.  Separately, the Court has issued an order suspending Verant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering Verant to comply with Rule 5c-8. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Welshhans and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Denver Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
