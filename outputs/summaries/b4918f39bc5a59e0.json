  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against defendant Johnny Ray Cochran in a parallel criminal case arising out of the shooting death of Melony Strickland.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that Cochran violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The complaint further alleges that, in August 2007, Cochran allegedly borrowed his mother\u2019s silver, four-door Buick sedan and, according to the complaint, while he was driving, he made numerous calls to her.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, the defendant never showed up at the scene of the murder and, instead, simply left the area in the vehicle.  According to the SEC, after learning that the prowler had been observed in the area on the night of the killing, he returned to the scene and asked to \"hide\" his vehicle, which was later discovered in the home of his ex-wife.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Cochran.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the U. S. District Judge's Office in Atlanta issued an order suspending Cochran from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  A hearing for the SEC is scheduled for June 5, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2019."
