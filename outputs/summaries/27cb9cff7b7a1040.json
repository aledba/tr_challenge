  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on January 18, 2013, Christine Goesel filed a petition for dissolution of marriage from her husband, Andrew Goesel, alleging that Goldstine had improperly ordered her to repay attorney fees that had been earned by her husband.  According to the complaint, the complaint further alleged that, as a result of this conduct, the defendants were unable to pay their attorney fees, and the court ultimately ordered that the defendants pay disgorgement of $37,094.49.  In a parallel action, on March 19, 2015, the U. S. District Judge in Chicago issued an order requiring the defendants to disgorge $16,000 in fees that they had already earned, with $6,000 going to Holwell and $26,000 to LeVine.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendants agreed to settle the case by agreeing to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Defendants also agreed to pay civil penalties in the amount of $40,952.49, which is equal to the amount that they have already paid to each party.  On March 20, 2014, the court granted the defendants' motion for leave to withdraw from the case and ordered them to pay $37.49 in disgorgements, which represents the amount owed to them by the parties in the civil injunctions proceeding against them. The court also issued a temporary restraining order against the defendants, freezing their assets, and imposing a civil penalty of $100 per day.  Defendants also consented to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining them from violating the antigorgement provisions of the federal securities laws, and from violating Section 10b of the Exchange Act.
