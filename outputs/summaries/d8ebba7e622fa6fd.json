  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against Mississippi State University's former head football coach for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, in 2008, Alcorn State hired Jones as an assistant football coach and hired him as his head coach. The complaint alleges that Jones failed to comply with the terms of the contract and failed to timely respond to Alcorn's requests for leave to amend his complaint.  According to the complaint, Jones then filed a civil injunctive action against Alcorn, alleging that he had breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing by failing to timely comply with Alcorn&rsquo;s requests for a cease-and-desist order and an injunction preventing him from violating the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the SEC today announced that it has obtained a court order freezing the assets of Alcorn and ordering Alcorn to pay a civil penalty of $500,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Jones consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,038, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively.  On May 24, 2017, the U. S. Attorney's Office for Mississippi announced criminal charges against Jones arising from the same conduct alleged in the Complaint. The SEC also announced that the SEC had obtained a temporary restraining order against Jones and ordered the SEC to conduct an investigation into the alleged misconduct.  Among other things, the court found that Alcorn violated his duty of fair dealing when he misappropriated funds from his employer, and ordered him to repay the amount of his ill-gotten gains with interest in a civil monetary penalty.  Alcorn also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public university for five years.  A hearing on May 26, 2017 was scheduled for 12:30 p.m. Eastern.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The litigation is being led by Jennifer C. McKinley and supervised by Scott A. Kasper.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Mississippi Department of Insurance."
