  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Ivory Carter, a sales manager at a dealership-owned Nissan Murano, and her cousin, Rashard Mosley, in a parallel criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Appellant used her cousin\u2019s telephone to arrange a meeting with Frederick Knight, a convicted felon who was also charged in the case. According to the complaint, the two men confronted each other in the parking lot of a car lot and demanded that they turn over their car keys. The complaint further alleges that, after the meeting, Knight allegedly confronted Appelleant with a gun and demanded her turn over her car keys, which were taken from the car. The SEC alleges that during the course of the trial, the defendants engaged in a series of telephone conversations, including one in which the defendant allegedly described himself as a \"liar\" and a \u201cperjurer.\u201d The SEC also alleges that one of the men in the carjacking spree allegedly told the woman that he should have had a wallet in his possession at the time he was murdered. The court also found that, while conducting its investigation, the defendant used a different telephone number to contact a co-defendant in the same criminal case, a different individual, to convince him not to do anything, and that the same individual had engaged in an earlier armed robbery and attempted armed robbery. The defendants also allegedly used the same phone number to make a statement to law enforcement, telling the other individual that he did not have a wallet. Finally, the complaint alleges that the trial counsel failed to object when an investigator, who was discussing Singleton's telephone records, testified that the woman had asked Singleton to check the phone of an acquaintance who had been robbed. The jury was told that Singleton had agreed to a five-year prison term, which would have required her to surrender her gun and surrender it to the authorities. Instead, Singleton and Mosley allegedly entered into plea agreements without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, and agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay a penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against the defendants."
