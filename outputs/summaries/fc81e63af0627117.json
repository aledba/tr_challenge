  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E) in a civil injunctive action brought by the Commission in 2005.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orange County, California, alleges that SDEG&E violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the Commission violated Section 15(a) of Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that, contrary to the Commission\u2019s order, SDG&e failed to establish the requisite nexus between the costs of abandoned transmission infrastructure projects and the incentives it seeks. SDG &E also alleged that, for example, SDEG &E failed to demonstrate that it incurred significant costs on the project before it obtained the declaratory order, and failed to show a sufficient nexus between those costs and the incentive incentive it sought. The SEC also alleges SDEG and SDEG+E violated Rule 15a-1, which requires utilities to pay a certain percentage of project costs in the event of a delay in approving a project.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, SDeg&E consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws, orders it to pay disgorgement of $31 million in prejudgment interest, and orders a civil penalty of $5,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) today announced that it has issued an order suspending trading in the securities of publicly-traded utilities. The Commission's order, which entered final judgment on Sep. 23, 2015, orders the CFTC to conduct a conduct-based determination of whether a project qualifies for a certain type of incentive treatment. The order also requires the Commission to determine whether a certain amount of incentive compensation is appropriate for a particular project, and to determine how much of that incentive compensation should be reimbursed to ratepayers. In addition, the Commission has issued a rule requiring utilities to show that they incurred significant amounts of project-related costs in order to recover those costs. In its order, CFTC also issued a Rule that required utilities to provide investors with an accounting of costs incurred in connection with their investment in the project. CFTC's order requires that utilities provide a \"comprehensive understanding\" of the risks presented by the project and that investors should be prepared to share those costs with the utility. The court also ordered the Commission not to impose a price-based incentive treatment without a reasonable nexus to the costs"
