  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Ditech Financial LLC, a Florida-based registered representative, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that, on September 4, 2015, Ditech filed a motion for a show cause order against Wilson Marin and Paola Sibon, defendants in connection with an indirect criminal contempt proceeding. The complaint alleges that Ditech failed to produce the power point presentation at the cancelled, midnight deposition, and that attorney Jacobs, who had no prior involvement in the case, improperly sought to obstruct the proceedings by failing to produce a copy of the Power Point presentation. Ditech also allegedly failed to comply with a court order requiring it to show cause why it should not be held in contempt of court for violations of Rule 3.840.  In a parallel action, on January 2, 2018, the Florida Court of Appeals granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Ditech to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,038,767, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Ditech agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The court also granted the defendants' motion for an emergency court order, which requires the trial court to determine whether to impose civil penalties against the defendants.  On January 6, 2019, the court issued an order suspending proceedings against the petitioners, and ordering the court to consider the merits of the case. The order also ordered that the court consider whether to issue an order requiring the defendants to produce documents to the court in order to prevent a hearing from going forward on the motion.  According to the complaint, the Court found that the defendants were entitled to permanent injunctions against future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordered the defendants not to violate the court's orders. The Court also issued a subpoena to prevent the defendants from destroying any evidence that could be used to determine the cause of a criminal contempt action.  A hearing scheduled for July 24, 2017, was not conducted by the court, and Judge Echarte granted the motion for emergency court approval. The hearing was conducted in the absence of a court reporter, and the litigation was conducted by Yacinda Hudson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Compliance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the U."
