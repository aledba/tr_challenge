  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against a former prison inmate for making material misrepresentations to a federal court.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, from at least 2003 through at least 2017, former prison guard Michael Johnson misstated the number of previously-filed lawsuits that he had filed while incarcerated.  According to the complaint, Johnson failed to disclose at least two of the previously-mentioned cases, and he failed to include them in the final judgment.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Central and Southern Districts of Illinois issued a show-cause order requiring Johnson to comply with the court order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Johnson consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  On December 18, 2017, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Johnson, ordering him to sign a cease-and-desist order, imposing a $25,000 civil penalty, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against him from future violations of the federal securities laws.  Johnson agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations, and agreed to pay a $20,000 penalty.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for a period of five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Erickson of the Division of Justice's Office. The litigation will be led by Margo Schlanger. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Office of Inspector General, and the Illinois Department of Corrections."
