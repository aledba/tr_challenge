  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of Anthony Calleo, a New Jersey resident who died on July 24, 2013.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Newark, New Jersey, on August 2, 2013, the Court found that, in contemplation of death, the Decedent executed a will devising all of his estate, real, personal or mixed, for a sum of less than $100. The court also found that the transfer was not deemed to have taken effect at the time of death.  The Court also ruled that, contrary to the Court's finding, the transfer had the effect of a shift in beneficial interest from one person to another, and that the estate was not subject to the inheritance tax.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Economic and Risk Analysis and the Office of the Secretary of State's Office today issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of overcharging investors with investments in real estate.\u00c2\u00a0In its Investor Alert, the SEC\u00c2\u00a0warned investors to be aware of potential conflicts of interest when making a purchase or sale of a property.  Investors can quickly and easily check whether their investments are subject to investment decisions by using the Investor Alert to quickly identify whether they are registered with the SEC. Investors can also quickly check whether investments in a particular investment are subject, for example, whether the investment adviser has retained any beneficial interest in the property and whether the investor has deferred the purchase of the property until a time which can only be measured by reference to the transferor's death. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Financial Regulation in this matter."
