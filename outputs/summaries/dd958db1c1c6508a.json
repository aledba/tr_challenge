  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against a Shreveport man for the attempted second-degree murder of a former football player.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Jemetric Debrow was convicted of the felony and sentenced to 65 years at hard labor without benefits in 1999.  According to the complaint, Debrow told his sister that he was shot from behind as he approached the front door in his effort to escape, and then was shot in the head as the defendants left.  He also told her that he had lost all of his teeth, due to the bullet in his head.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendant was a model prisoner who was rehabilitated and punished.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Central District of New York today entered a final judgment against Debrow, permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission of Inquiry, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  Debrow also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the Commission's judgments, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On October 11, 2018, the court granted a motion to revoke Debrow's sentence and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, which is equal to the penalty imposed by the Commission on January 29, 1997.  At the hearing, Judge Bryson granted the request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Debrow to comply with the order.  A hearing scheduled for October 26, 2018 was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. for the SEC to consider the merits of the proposed amendment.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael Lott, James Sorrells, and Amy Gwiazda of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit in the New Orleans Regional Office. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance"
