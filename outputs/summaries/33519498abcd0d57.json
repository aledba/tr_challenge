  "summary": "On July 29, 2014, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant who was improperly dismissed by a trial judge based on his or her views on the merits of the case.  The court found that defendant Adrian Sassen Van Elsloo violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Van ElSloo was dismissed on the basis of a finding that he or she was unable to participate in a fair and impartial jury trial.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.   The SEC's Complaint alleges that, in a parallel case, the trial judge improperly dismissed a potential juror based on her or her view of the facts of the matter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as a judge for a period of five years.  Van El Sloo agreed to the judgment, which also prohibits her from participating in jury selection, and orders her to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations. The court also ordered her to pay disgorgement of her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2,500. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In addition, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
