  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a temporary restraining order against Karen Vaughn, the former director of the Indiana Division of Aging, who has been institutionalized since 1976.  According to the court's order, filed on January 9, 2018, Ms. Vaughn was institutionalized for nearly three years, and her case was handled by Erin Wright, the Division's Director of Access and Engagement.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and that the court should order the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Indiana today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating these provisions, orders them to pay civil penalties of $150,000, and orders the destruction of any evidence that may have been obtained in the case.  On January 11, 2019, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans of the Court granted the SEC's motion for summary judgment against the Defendants, which was entered without prejudice by the court on January 8, 2018.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Wright. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Indiana Department of Health and Human Services. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a home healthcare program.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.
