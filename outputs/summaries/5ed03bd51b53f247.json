  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee today entered a final judgment against a Tennessee man who was convicted of stealing from a Tennessee Wal-Mart.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, alleges that Charles Keese violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Keese has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 5 of the Public Safety Act, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000 or more but less than $10,000.  According to the complaint, Keese was sentenced to a 12-year prison term.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Middle Tennessee announced criminal charges against Keese.  On February 14, 2018, the Court of Criminal Appeals granted Keese's motion for permission to appeal, without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s findings, to the motion for a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and an officer and director bar.

It also ordered Keese to pay civil penalties of $2,500 and $3,500, respectively, for each of the three theft-related charges he has previously been convicted of, and that Keese will pay a penalty of 12 months and a $500,000 civil penalty.  Additionally, the order issued on January 1, 2017, requires the court to determine the severity of the penalty for the other three felony theft charges in the case before it, and requires the receiver to make reasonable restitution to the relief defendant.  Without admitting to these violations, Keefe consented to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining him from further violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 5, and ordering him to"
