  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that defendant pleaded guilty to sexual abuse in the first degree and was sentenced to 75 months of prison.  According to the complaint, defendant presented evidence that he would be subjected to greater risk of abuse while incarcerated because of his intellectual disability than if he were not incarcerated.  In addition, defendant offered testimony that he suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome, which is an impairment of one\u2019s ability to read social cues, and that he was able to distinguish between people he likes and dislikes, using the example of a letter from jail that defendant wrote to his family that requested his family crop a picture of his brother, the father of the victim, from a photo he wanted his family to send him.   The complaint further alleges that the defendant knew his actions were wrong when he was committing the abuse as evidenced by the fact that defendant plied the victim with treats to prevent her from disclosing the abuse.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 75 months, followed by post-prison supervision, the total duration of both penalties, and a proportionality determination based on the severity of the sentence.  Additionally, the court granted the defendant a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from associating with anyone with intellectual disabilities, and ordered him to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court on the merits of the case. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Roper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oregon Department of Corrections, and the Oregon Attorney General's Office in this matter."
