  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against Kentucky Health and Human Services, Inc., a federal agency that administers the federal health insurance program, Kentucky HEALTH.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky, alleges that Kentucky Health, which administers Medicaid, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the SEC improperly sought to bar Kentucky Health from participating in the federal program.  According to the complaint, Kentucky Health sought a Section 1115 waiver to implement an experimental project, Helping to Engage and Achieve Long Term Health, in which it would provide low-income adults with work-eligibility and health insurance.  Kentucky Health's complaint alleges that, in reality, the federal government only approved the project in Kentucky.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Kentucky Healthcare, LLC, a Kentucky-based health and human services company, has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action on behalf of Kentucky Health.  On March 30, 2018, the court granted Kentucky Health & Human Services' request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Kentucky Health to comply with the court's order. The court also issued an order temporarily freezing Kentucky Health&Human Services' assets, including the assets of the Kentucky Health Department, the Kentucky Department of Health, and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office. The Court's order freezes Kentucky Health Health's assets and orders Kentucky Health Services to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of the matter. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia today announced criminal charges against KentuckyHealth&HumanServices.gov and KentuckyHealthcare.gov for related administrative proceedings. The SEC is continuing its litigation against Kentucky Healthcare.gov.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (August 24, 2013).  The Court also granted Kentucky's request for an emergency court order, ordering the SEC to provide a copy of the final judgment, which was entered by the court on March 31, 2018.  To learn more about federal court injunctions against state-based transfers of Medicaid funds, see Federal Bureau of Investigation v. Kelly L. Gibson, et al. (Aug. 24, 2014).
