  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Melissa Everly, a former foster parent who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, on January 4, 2017, the Arkansas Department of Human Services (DHS) took a seventy-two-hour hold on BE (DOB 11/05/06) based on allegations that Melissa failed to protect BE by allowing her boyfriend, Joseph Henry, into her home and around BE after BE made allegations of sexual contact with another child. Melissa allegedly told the caseworker that her boyfriend was a \"very sexualized child\" and \"very personable.\" Melissa also claimed that her sister, Melissa Tuck-Duty, was in a kinship-foster placement with her paternal grandparents when she was removed from the home. The court found that Melissa was in worse shape at the time of the termination hearing than she had been when the case began because she was totally dependent on others for her entire living.  The court also ordered Melissa to complete domestic-violence education and to provide meaningful support to her sister.  Melissa's attorney, Dustin Barlow, agreed with the court's finding that the termination was not in the children's best interest because of Melissa's inability to maintain a stable relationship with her father.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Melissa consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently restrains her parental rights from being terminated.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Arkansas today announced criminal charges against Melissa.  On May 30, 2018, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Melissa and ordered her to provide a copy of her 2017 HUD and food-stamp applications to the agency's Office of Inspector General, which also issued an order suspending her from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Melissa for her role in the same conduct alleged in the Commission's complaint against her. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott Frost, John Rymas, and Eric Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Frost and Ms. Werner. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
