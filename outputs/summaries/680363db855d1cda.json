  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against a Michigan man accused of defrauding his employer by falsely certifying that he was eligible to receive unemployment benefits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, alleges that, on November 30, 2010, appellee Frank Lucente lost his job and was hired as a full-time employee by Dart Properties II, LLC (Dart). The complaint alleges that the agency issued a redetermination of his eligibility for unemployment benefits in violation of Sections 54(a) and 54(c) of the Unemployment Insurance Act of 1940. The complaint further alleges that in a parallel action, the federal agency issued two redeterminations to determine whether the claimant was eligible and qualified for benefits. The agency issued the redetermination without informing the agency of its finding, and instead, from February 20, 2010 through June 19, 2010 falsely certified that he had improperly received benefits through fraud. The SEC alleges that this redetermination violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the agency has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Michigan against the agency for violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Insurance, and the Michigan State Corporation Commission in this matter."
