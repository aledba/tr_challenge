  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Rayon D. Hamilton, Jr., a convicted felon, for his role in two prior sexual assaults.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, alleges that Hamilton, who was previously convicted of two prior felony charges of sexual assault, used a combination of hearsay and fact-finding to conclude that Hamilton had committed the two prior acts of misconduct.  According to the complaint, Hamilton told the investigating detective that he had \"the tech guys work on [the phone] and he had the idea of having sex with her.\"  The complaint further alleges that, based on Hamilton's testimony, the jury could not determine whether Hamilton had engaged in a prior sexual assault without knowing that the phone contained text messages from J.F.  Hamilton also allegedly had a prior felony conviction for kidnapping.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Hamilton, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hamilton consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000.   Hamilton has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a $1,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000, which is equal to the penalty imposed by the federal district court for Hamilton's prior criminal conviction, and requires him to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations.  Additionally, Hamilton has agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to a three-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any future conduct-related criminal proceeding.  He has also consented not to be named as a defendant in the case of a civil injunctive action brought by the district court against him.  Finally, the court granted the request for a temporary restraining order against Hamilton and ordered him to comply with the court's order requiring him to provide a copy of the Complaint to the jury.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Kathleen M. McCole granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the ant"
