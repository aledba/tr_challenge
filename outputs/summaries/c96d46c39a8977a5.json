  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against two Tijuana residents for their roles in an alleged drug-trafficking scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Tijuana, Mexico, alleges that, from at least 2016 through 2017, the Tijuana Regional Office (CRO) and the Mexican Department of Integrity of Families (DIF) raised the issue of whether to dismiss the children's dependency petitions.  According to the complaint, the CRO's complaint alleges that the children were left in an abandoned home with no electricity, no potable water, and with cockroaches crawling near minors' bed.  In addition, the complaint alleges the children had not been to school for over a year and were left without any provision for their care.  As alleged in the Complaint, the defendants had been living in the same home for seven months and had not had any contact with their children since July 2016, when they were placed in the custody of DIF.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the court granted the agency's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the destruction of documents, including the names of the victims, and bars the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any of the above-mentioned documents.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, charging them with violating Section 9 of the Exchange Act and Rule 9a-3 thereunder and with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (\"Advisers\").  The complaint also charges the defendants with aiding and abetting DIF's violations of Section 300(g) and Section 9, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.   The case is being handled by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Criminal Division's San Diego Regional Office, and Antonia Chion. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mexican Attorney General's Office, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
