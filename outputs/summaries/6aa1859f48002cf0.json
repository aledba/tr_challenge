  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against a former Salt Lake City Police Department officer charged with aiding and abetting a drug-trafficking ring.  The SEC's complaint, filed on September 11, 2018, alleges that, in October 2011, the Salt Lake County District Attorney's Office obtained an emergency court order to expedite the filing of a civil injunctive action against Samuel Covarrubias-Velazquez, who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Arciniega agreed to the court's order without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Arcinierega. The SEC also announced that it has obtained a court order halting an ongoing investigation of a drug ring that has been operating in the area for more than a year.  On September 13, 2013, a federal district court in Denver issued an order halting the ongoing investigation, ordering the SEC to conduct an independent review of the matter. The investigation was conducted by Jason Kennedy, Jason R. LaFave, and Eric R. Werner of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Kennedy and Ms. Werner. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the Utah Department of Justice in this matter."
