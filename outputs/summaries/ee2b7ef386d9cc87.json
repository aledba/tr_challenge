  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against Apple, Inc. (\"Apple\"), a defendant in a class action action brought by two California residents, alleging that Apple's iPhone 4, 4S, and 5 smartphones were sold with a defective power button.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, Apple and its attorneys, Gregory Pinsonneault and Gregory Schenkelberg, falsely claimed to be able to calculate damages based on Apple's claims, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, Apple's iPhones were not manufactured with a power button defect and did not have a functioning one.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Apple failed to disclose the power button's failure rate when it purchased the iPhone, and failed to do so when it replaced the iPhone with a newer model.  As alleged, the complaint further alleges that defendants' expert opinion evidence, which was not supported by the court's order, was unreliable because it did not consider the relevant facts of the case presented to the court.  For example, according to the complaint, the jury found that the jury could not determine whether a defendant's claims were reasonable based on the facts presented to them, and the jury had the right to determine whether the jury was entitled to a judgment that would impose a permanent injunction, impose a conduct-based injunction, and order the defendant to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, which would be offset by a civil penalty of $20,000.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant learning tool to quickly identify people who may be at risk of losing their investment. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that defendants violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(3) of Exchange Act Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgements of ill-gotten gains plus interest, and an officer and director bar against Apple.  Additionally, the Complaint seeks a court-ordered injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, a court order prohibiting Apple from issuing or selling any security products, and a penny stock bar against"
