  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Apple Inc., a California-based manufacturer of \"state-of-the-art\" computer screens, for failing to adequately disclose material omissions related to the issue of screen smudging.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, Arizona, alleges that Apple violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Apple is liable under Section 17(a)(1) for its violations of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Apple failed to adequately demonstrate that its computer screens were \"clear and remarkably vivid\" and of the \"highest quality\" when, in fact, Apple did not test its products extensively.  Apple also failed to disclose that Apple's computer screens suffered from a \"critical defect\" in its user-guide manual.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Apple consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Apple, alleging that Apple engaged in a fraudulent concealment and a related conduct-based injunctive action, and ordering Apple to pay civil penalties of $10,000 and $20,000, respectively.  On August 2, 2019, the court granted Apple's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17 (a)(2)(A) of Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17(b)(5)(B) thereunder. The court also granted Apple a temporary restraining order against future violations of Section 9(a) of Exchange Act Rule 9(b).  The court's order, which is subject to court approval, orders Apple to comply with the court's orders and to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  Separately, Apple agreed to a settlement where it will be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Leadsinger, Kelly L. Gibson, and Patrick J. McCluskey of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson."
