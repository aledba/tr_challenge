  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against Tristan James Melland, who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle on April 4, 2016, Melland was arrested by Virginia Mason health care providers for a domestic violence no-contact order. The complaint alleges that on June 10, 2016 Melland allegedly confronted D.J. outside her Queen Anne apartment building and told her that his \"boyfriend of six years has abused her in the past and is responsible for breaking her finger.\" The complaint further alleges that Melland told her he would \"get her things from her apartment\" and \"turn her hand really hard and twist it so hard that it broke her finger\" when he grabbed the phone from her hand the second he came in the door of her apartment building.  The complaint also alleges that, during the course of the alleged assault, the defendant allegedly took photographs of the injured woman's hand and twisted it so that she could see the injury.  Melland also allegedly told the social worker that he had a \"poorly applied nonmedical splint\" on her right pinky finger.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Melland. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Williams, Kelly L. Gibson, and Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Williams and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
