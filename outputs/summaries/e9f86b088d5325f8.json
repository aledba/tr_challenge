  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a preliminary injunction against a California-based construction company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Queen of the Valley Medical Center (QVMC) violated Section 8(a)(1), (3) and (4) and that QVMC failed to timely reserve its right to challenge the union's certification.  According to the complaint, the Director of the Division of Labor and Human Resources (D.N.J. Department of Justice) issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering the company to cease and desist from engaging in unconditional bargaining with the union.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the company.  On March 16, 2017, the District Court entered a final judgment against the employer, ordering it to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the company consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion of the district court.  Additionally, the court granted the company's request for a temporary injunction against further violations of Section 8 of the Exchange Act and Rules 8b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder, and ordered the employer to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer and director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval.
