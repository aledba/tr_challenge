  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Washington today announced criminal charges against Joshua Cane Frahm for vehicular homicide.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on December 7, 2014 in federal court in Vancouver, Washington, Frahman was driving his truck erratically at a high rate of speed on several freeways when he nearly rear-ended a vehicle driven by Steven Klase.  The complaint alleges that, shortly before 6:00 a.m., the truck driver hit and injured Klase's vehicle, causing it to spin and ricochet, leaving Irvine approximately 20 feet across the roadway and causing him to sustain severe brain and spinal injuries.  As alleged in the complaint, the driver did not notice the impact to Klase\u2019s vehicle until it was too late to avoid hitting it.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, however, the complaint charges the driver with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney&rdsquotidian Division of the Southern District of New York today announced related criminal charges.  On December 8, 2017, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins defendants from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000, $20,000 and $1,500, respectively. The court also ordered the defendant to pay a $2,500 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by John R. Hartley and Tony Honore and supervised by Marc Blau. The litigation will be led by Messrs. Lafave and Hartley. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Seattle Police Department, and the Washington State Attorney General's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17, July 17, 2018."
