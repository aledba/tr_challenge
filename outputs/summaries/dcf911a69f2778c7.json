  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jean C. May, a resident of the John Knox Manor nursing home in Montgomery County, Alabama, for her role in the agency's denial of Jean's application for Medicaid benefits.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama on January 24, 2017, Jean and Isaac May, who reside in the nursing home, were told by the agency that they would be entitled to a $335,599.19 valuation of the couple's resources for purposes of determining their eligibility for the federal program. The complaint alleges that, in reality, Jean's resources were not included in the calculation of her eligibility for Medicaid, and that the agency failed to consider the financial responsibility of the institutionalized spouse in determining her eligibility.  The complaint further alleges that Jean's husband, Isaac W. May (\u201cIsaac\u201d), made a bona fide effort to sell the Wagnon property to the agency in order to qualify for Medicaid.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the agency did not consider the value of the property as a sufficient basis for determining Jean's eligibility. Instead, as the complaint alleges, it relied on the financial condition of the individual and his or her spouse.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Jean failed to demonstrate that she had sufficient assets to support her husband and that her husband was entitled to protect $120,900 in assets.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Jean consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,500. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Marc Blumer, Chief of the Alabama Division of Health and Human Services. The Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Department of Health, and the Alabama Secretary of State's Office."
