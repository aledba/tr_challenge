According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, Estime and Bonventure, driver and owner of a car, intentionally drove onto the sidewalk intending to hit a car and then hit another car. The complaint alleges that Estime was convicted of the class D felony of vehicular manslaughter in the second degree, which requires the involvement of a person convicted of a serious criminal crime, and that Bonventure was liable as a party for causing the death of the decedent. The SEC also found that Bonventures was liable for the same conduct as Estime, for not reporting income on his tax return and for filing false expense vouchers with his employer. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Bonventure consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000.

Bonventure has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  On May 11, 2017, the court issued an order suspending Bonventure from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to provide an accounting of the amount and nature of his ill-gotten gains with respect to his criminal history. The court also ordered Estime to surrender his passport and pay a $75,000 civil penalty, which he has already agreed to pay.  Bonventure agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the securities laws.
