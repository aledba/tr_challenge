  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Wells Fargo Bank, N.Y.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Wells Fargo violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Wells Fargo failed to timely respond to the lender's requests for a temporary restraining order, a cease-and-desist order, or an order requiring the lender to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $100,000.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the lender failed to comply with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and failed to send a certified or registered notice to the borrower in compliance with those requirements.  Wells Fargo's complaint also alleges that it failed to provide a copy of a preforeclosure notice sent by the lender in violation of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's judgment, the bank consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions and orders it to pay civil penalties of $10,000, $20,000 and $50,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a $10 million civil penalty.  Finally, the court granted the bank's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordered Wells Fargo to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted in the SEC's New York office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Department of Banking, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-11 (January 21, 2013)."
