  "summary": "The Honorable Phyllis M. Gorham of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina today entered final judgments against defendant Douglas Nelson Edwards on three counts of attempted first-degree murder, statutory sex offense with a child by an adult, assault with deadly weapon inflicting serious injury (\u201cAWDWISI\u201d), first degree kidnapping, and taking indecent liberties with a children.  The court also found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the jury was entitled to a new trial based on the jury's finding that defendant was not entitled to participate in the investigation and rescue of the juvenile.  According to the court's order, the jury had the opportunity to consider the overwhelming evidence against defendant, including testimony by those who either witnessed the abduction or saw defendant with the juvenile, testimony by law enforcement about the case, testimony from medical personnel who examined the juvenile during the investigation, and testimony from a school bus that passed defendant while he was being questioned.  In addition, the court found that defendant's pre-and post-arrest interrogation was separate from the interview of defendant on the 14 September 2016 interview, from which the defendant sought to introduce a transcript or recording of the interview.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000, which is equal to the penalty imposed by the court on the defendant.  On the same day, the Honorable Gorham granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered him to return to the United States to be enjoined from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Charlotte, North Carolina, charges defendant with violating Rule 5a-14, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The SEC is seeking a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0The Securities Act, and the Commission on Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 206(3) and (4) thereunder. The complaint also seeks a conduct-based injunction prohibiting defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged violations of Section 5"
