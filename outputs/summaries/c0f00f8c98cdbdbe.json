  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment against defendant Chinikka Lockhart and Mohamed Kamara, agreeing to settle the SEC's charges against them.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Jersey, alleges that, on June 13, 2016, defendant and two confederates went to the home of Mario Lombardo, Jr. to steal his marijuana. According to the complaint, defendants agreed to the offer of a thirty-year sentence based on the advice of a trial judge, who deemed the offer reasonable and reasonable. The complaint also alleges that defendant and Kamara engaged in an aggressive plea colloquy, in which defendants allegedly told the judge that an open plea would result in a minimum of thirty years in prison, and that the judge should consider whether to impose a second- or a third-year extended-term sentence on the defendant. The court ultimately refused to consider the merits of the offer.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0order\u00c2\u00a0to expedite the filing of an SEC complaint. The SEC complaint charges defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Manhattan, alleging that defendant violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act, Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder and Section 13(b)(2) and (3) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and (4) and 13b2-1 thereunder. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the New Jersey Office of the Attorney General's Office and supervised by Carolyn M. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter."
