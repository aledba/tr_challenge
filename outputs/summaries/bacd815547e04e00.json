  "summary": "On May 16, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington entered a final judgment against Casey Taylor, a Washington, D.C.-area electronic technician who was denied a job because of a perceived disability.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, Taylor was told that he had a \"physiological disorder, or condition\" that affects multiple body systems.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to what the complaint alleges, Taylor had a history of obesity, and that he was unable to perform the functions of his job because he was overweight.  As alleged in the complaint, however, obesity is not a medical condition, and as a result of a physical impairment, Taylor did not get or keep the job.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that Taylor had been diagnosed as having an \u201cimpairment\u201d with obesity, which is a physiological condition affecting one or more of the body systems listed in the federal disability laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Taylor consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Seattle Police Department, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
