  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against Johnny Ray Cyr for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Cyr from violating the mandatory minimum sentencing provision of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, filed on July 24, 2017, Cyr pleaded guilty to three counts of selling a controlled substance for profit in violation of RCW 69.50.410, which provides that a person convicted of a first or subsequent felony can be sentenced to a mandatory minimum sentence of 60 months.  In addition, the court found that Cyr had a prior qualifying conviction for a second or subsequent drug offense and that he had a full understanding of the nature of these offenses and the consequences to pleading guilty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Cyr consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar, as well as a $500,000 penalty.  On August 23, 2018, the Court of Appeals in Seattle issued an order requiring the SEC to determine the statutory minimum sentence for each of Cyr\u2019s prior drug convictions, and ordering the imposition of a five-year, 60-month, and 90-month penalty, respectively.   The SEC also ordered the issuance of an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, ordering the receiver to conduct a background check on the receiver and to determine whether the receiver had any prior qualifying convictions.  Additionally, the SEC issued a subpoena for a copy of the subpoena, which was obtained by the SEC through the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter.
