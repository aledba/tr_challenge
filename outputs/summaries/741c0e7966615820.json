  "summary": "On November 27, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 14602 of the federal securities laws by unlawfully impounding vehicles for 30 days without being issued a California driver's license.  According to the complaint, the defendants' vehicles were impounded in 2011, well before this date, when they had never been issued a license. The complaint further alleges that, on the basis of this conduct, they could not have had the requisite specific intent to impound a vehicle when the driver had been issued one.  In its judgment, the court found that, in violation of the charged provisions of the securities laws, the Defendants were liable as a final policymaker for violating those provisions.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their civil monetary penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 14602-6 (2014).  The complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 14603 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgment of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interests, and a civil penalty.  On November 26, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in the United Kingdom District Court against the Defendants, alleging that the District Court improperly granted summary judgment to the defendants on their violations of Sections 14602 and 14602.6 of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a preliminary injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and other emergency relief.  A hearing for the defendants is scheduled for May 24, 2019.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation of the matter was conducted by John Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by Eric Werner of the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, the Internal Revenue Service, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
