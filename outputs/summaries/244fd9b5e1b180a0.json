  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment in favor of GlaxoSmithKline, LLC (\"GSK\"), a pharmaceutical company that manufactures and sells paroxetine, an antidepressant.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that GSK negligently failed to include a warning about the risk of adult suicide in the company's clinical trials.  According to the complaint, on July 15, 2010, Mr. Dolin, a 57-year old attorney who was suffering from depression, went to a Chicago train station and jumped in front of a train. The complaint alleges that shortly before his death, GSK sent him a copy of a clinical trial report that showed that there was a significant increase in the rate of adult suicides among patients who took the drug.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the company failed to adequately disclose that the drug can induce suicidal behavior in adults.  GSK also failed to show that it had a duty of care in creating and controlling the label.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against GSK for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  A hearing for the SEC is scheduled for May 24, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 596 (7th Cir. 2010).  The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Office of Inspector General, and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
