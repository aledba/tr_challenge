  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered default judgment against a California-based boatyard and its owner in a civil action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sausalito, California on May 23, 2019, alleges that on June 29, 2017, Daniel A. Morgan and his vessel, the \"Self Inflicted,\" entered into a Service Agreement with Morgan that provided for repair and maintenance work at the company's boatyard.  According to the complaint, the vessel incurred repairs, hull maintenance, and storage charges in the amount of $15,748.13, for a total of $40,550.13.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Vessel's custodian, Paul Kaplan, failed to timely respond to the Commission's requests to foreclose the lien.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amounts of $6,590.00, $9,158.13 and $11,597.14, respectively.  On December 19, 2020, the Commission issued an order granting default judgment to the Vessel, which is subject to court approval.   The Commission's order granted default judgment on June 24, 2019 and ordered the vessel to be condemned and sold by the United States Marshal pursuant to Rule 5(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder. The Commission also ordered the Vessel to pay a civil penalty of $20,000.  It also ordered that the vessel be returned to the owner, who has not yet consented, and that it be certified by the Commission as a merchant before the date of entry of default judgment.  Finally, the court granted the Commission the right to determine whether to enter default judgment based on the merits of the complaint.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1064308.  Separately, the SEC filed an enforcement action against the vessel, charging it with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charging the vessel with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Adviser Advisers\") and Rules 206(3) and 206 (4)-8 thereunder and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation was conducted by David A. Kasper and Eric R. Werner of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Kaplan."
