  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Iowa today entered a final judgment in favor of the Coxes, who are disabled and reside in a nursing home.  The court found that the federal government improperly allocated funds to pooled special needs trusts for disabled individuals.  According to the court's order, in 2015, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) improperly allocated millions of dollars to certain trusts for vulnerable seniors, including Edward and Susan Cox, who live at Westview Care Center in Indianola, Iowa.  As alleged in the court order, these trusts were for less than fair market value and required a delay in eligibility for long-term care benefits.  In its order, the court also ruled that certain transfers of assets were for a purpose other than to qualify for Medicaid benefits. The court also found that, in considering the facts of this case, the DHS had correctly interpreted and applied federal law requiring the delay in Medicaid eligibility to a certain extent.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1396p(c)(2)(B) of 1940.   The SEC's case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, John Rymas, and Eric R. Werner of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Iowa Secretary of State's Office, and the Iowa Department of Human Services in this matter."
