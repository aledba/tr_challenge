  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Jackson, Mississippi mother and father for their roles in a scheme to plant drugs in Will Smith's truck.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, from at least May 2014 through at least June 2016, Tamara Barbaro, a licensed licensed clinical trial physician, and her husband, Chris Kyzar, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Barbaro told the chancellor that she believed that Smith had abused drugs in the past, and that he had encouraged his son to use the drugs.  She also alleged that when Smith returned to Smith's house on May 15, he was groggy and lethargic.  Barbaro also allegedly told her that she had received a tip about Smith using the drugs in his truck and that she should have followed the advice of a home health nurse.  In a parallel action, the federal district court for New Jersey today entered a final judgment against Barbaro that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining Barbaro from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against her.  On June 20, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action seeking a temporary restraining order, an officer-and-director bar, and an order freezing Barbaro's assets, including her assets, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $20,000, which will be deemed satisfied by the court's order enjoining her from further violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder, and ordering her to comply with the court order.  Additionally, the order requires Barbaro to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 24, 2018).  The case was supervised by Brandy Jones, Chief of the Mississippi Office of Child and Family Education and Advocacy, with assistance from John Rymas of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.   The litigation will be led by Ms. Jones and Mr. Rymacs. "
