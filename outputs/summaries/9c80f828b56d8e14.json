  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Maine today entered a final judgment in favor of the then-Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives, Mark Eves, in a First Amendment case brought by the Maine Education Association against Paul LePage.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Maine, alleges that, while serving as Speaker of the House, Eves violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by acting as an unregistered broker of beneficial ownership and operation of a public school.  According to the complaint, after learning that LePage was going to withhold $1.5 million in discretionary state funding from GWH, he signed a letter to the GWH Board of Trustees stating that he would not take the money for GWH unless the Board agreed to support his plan to have a referendum vote on eliminating Maine's income tax.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Maine Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against Eves for violating the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the former Speaker of GWH.  Eves has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal and state securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,060,000, prejudgment interest of $2,750, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On May 3, 2016, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered Eves to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest to be determined by the court at a later date.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2017, is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Maine Secretary of State's Office of Public Education in this matter."
