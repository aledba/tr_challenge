  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the family court's motion to disqualify a lawyer and his law firm from representing a client in a divorce proceeding.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 26, 2018 in the United States District Court in the District of Hawaii, Hawai'i District Court Judge Michael J. Kakinami issued a judgment on May 3, 2019, that permanently enjoins DL from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders DL and CL to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law for child custody and relocation to Arizona.  The court's order also prohibits DL from acting as an unregistered broker or representative of a family court and from participating in any proceeding related to a divorce.  In a parallel action, on May 4, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court of Appeals issued an order permanently enjoining DL from future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The SEC's order further prohibits DL, CL, and Sansone from representing clients who are not entitled to custody of their children in a civil proceeding, including child custody.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains the bar against DL from serving as an attorney in any civil proceeding and orders him or her to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar.  Separately, the Court granted DL's request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rules 5a-5 and 5d-8 thereunder.  On May 3 and 4, 2019 the court entered a judgment against DL and certifying CL as a party to a pending divorce proceeding, ordering DL to submit a motion for pre-judgment interest in the matter, and ordering CL to send a copy of the judgment to the court for review.  DL's motion for a hearing on May 5, 2019 was denied by the court on May 2, 2018.  A hearing scheduled for May 3 is scheduled for April 24, 2019 to consider the merits of DL's and CL's claims.   The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Hawaii Department of Family and"
