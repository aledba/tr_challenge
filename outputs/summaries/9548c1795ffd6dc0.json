  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment in favor of Sarah Weiss and Larry Grant, who were married in 2007, and divorced in 2011, ordering them to pay $27,270 in child support. The court also ordered Grant to repay $100 per month in the form of a child custody arrearage. According to the SEC's complaint, Weiss and Grant filed a complaint in Paulding County, Georgia, alleging that the trial court improperly delegated the amount of child support Grant was required to pay to a South Carolina family court and delayed Grant\u2019s payment until after the children had reached the age of 18. The complaint alleges that the court improperly granted Grant one week of supervised visitation each month, which was insufficient because Grant had fled with the children and was unable to collect the child support due. The SEC alleges that Grant failed to return the children to Weiss, and the court granted Grant a temporary restraining order preventing him from violating the child custody order. In its final order, the court found that Grant was entitled to a second week of visitation, granting him the right to continue supervised visitation, and granting Grant the ability to continue unsupervised visitation until the children were 18. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Grant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently restrains the court from enforcing or refusing to modify custody or visitation rights for the children. The final judgment also permanently enjoins Weiss from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Bowers and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Gaunt. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.
