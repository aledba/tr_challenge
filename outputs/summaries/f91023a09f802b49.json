  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Gardena jeweler accused of orchestrating a long-running online harassment campaign.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Eric Bettinger, of Gardena, New Jersey, made a series of unreciprocated phone calls to his then and current girlfriend, Shelley Cooper, who he met through his work as a jewelry designer.  The complaint alleges that, in one of the calls, he allegedly told Cooper that he had a \"meteorite\" that he wanted to see and would like to see, and that he would like her to design gifts for a large gay-lesbian event he attended each year.  Instead, the complaint alleges, he sent a letter to Cooper stating that he \"knew\" that Ms. Cooper was part of the gay community and that she had had minimal contact with him since she was a teenager.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the letter did not mention the date of the alleged harassment, and instead described the nature of the harassment.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California today entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 527.6 of the federal securities laws, and ordering him to pay a $3,500 civil penalty.  He also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney and to be enjoined from associating with any person with whom he has a history of misconduct.  On June 21, 2011, the court granted the defendant a temporary restraining order against him and ordered him to show cause and effect in a court proceeding.  At the hearing on June 24, 2014, the judge granted the request for a preliminary injunction against the defendant and ordered the court to consider whether to issue an order imposing a permanent injunction against further violations of the anti-harassment provisions.  A hearing scheduled for July 15, 2014 was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. that same day.  After the hearing, the jury deliberated for two hours before finding Cooper guilty of violating Section 5"
