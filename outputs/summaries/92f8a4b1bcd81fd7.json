  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Arizona today announced criminal charges against Melissa Langevin for failing to timely serve a defendant with a summons and complaint within ninety days of filing the complaint.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on June 9, 2017, Langevin filed a complaint against Dr. Steven Sholem and Dr. John Carlson for negligently failing to serve the defendant within the 90-day time limit.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of Rule 4(i) of the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure, the defendant was barred by the statute of limitations from serving as an attorney.  In a parallel action, the Arizona Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against Langevin, charging her with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  As alleged in the complaint, the court found that Langevin failed to show reasonable diligence in serving the defendant, and that she had gained no \"tactical advantage\" by failing to show good cause for extending the time for service.   The SEC also charged Carlson with violating Rule 5(i), which requires a court to determine whether a defendant is entitled to an exemption from the pre-1996 rules for service of process.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Carlson consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the United States Attorney for the Central Valley of Arizona, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Arizona Office of Inspector General in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 17, 2019).
