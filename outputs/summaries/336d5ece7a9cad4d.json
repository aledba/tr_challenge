  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against South Bay Mental Health Center, Inc., a Massachusetts-based mental health provider, and its CEO, Peter J. Scanlon, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that South Bay and Scanlon violated the federal securities laws by submitting false claims for services of \"unlicensed, unqualified, and unsupervised personnel\" in violation of the federal licensing and supervision rules.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that the defendants knew or had reason to know that certain of the claims were false and fraudulent when they submitted them to the government.  For example, the SEC alleges that Scanlon was responsible for the submission of the false claims to South Bay, and for South Bay's receipt of the overpayments.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the securities laws, impose a civil penalty, and require them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties against the defendants.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against Scanlon.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Currid granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and appointing a receiver to oversee the collection and processing of the alleged claims.  Currid also issued an order suspending the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter to the defendants and ordering them to comply with the court's order.  A hearing on May 26, 2018 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. EST. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office, and the Massachusetts Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
