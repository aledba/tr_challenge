  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against a former contractor who was barred from serving as an officer and director of a federal government contracting company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Wilmington, North Carolina, alleges that former contractor Ariel Friedler violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Friedler consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, and agreed to a permanent injunction, to be barred from participating in federal government contracts, and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia today announced criminal charges against Friedler.  On September 4, 2015, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Philadelphia, charging Friedler with violating Section 9.406 of the federal securities laws, and ordering him to be debarred.  Friedler agreed to the permanent injunction and to a five-year conduct-based suspension, which is subject to court approval.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, the suspension was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to the agency's policy.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that Friedler did not receive any prior notice of the pending charges against him, and that he was not given an opportunity to respond to the allegations in the complaint before the final determination was made.  Additionally, the Complaint alleges that, in addition to failing to provide notice of Friedler's pending debarment, GSA also failed to consider whether Friedler had violated a provision of the Federal Contracting Act of 1940 (\"FAR\") that requires the agency to determine whether a person is entitled to participate in the development of new federal government lines of business, including contracts or work with the federal government.  Finally, it alleges that GSA failed to inform Friedler of the potential impact of his prior criminal conviction, and failed to provide him with a reasonable explanation for why he should not have been barred from doing business with the agency while he was suspended.  GSA's continuing investigation is being conducted by Todd Canni and Maria Swaby, and the litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Canni. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Office of Inspector General (OIGA) in this matter.
