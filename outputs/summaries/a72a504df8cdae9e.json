  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against SRA-L and Sabine River Authority of Louisiana for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, Louisiana, alleges that the defendants caused a \"deliberate release of water from the Toledo Bend spillway gates\" in response to the fact that the water level had surpassed 172.5 feet.  According to the complaint, the defendants deliberately chose to re-apply for and accept a renewal license to operate the facility in question, knowing that there was a substantial certainty that downstream flooding would occur.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants deliberately took steps to reduce the amount of water released into the reservoir.  For example, the SEC alleges that one of the defendants opened a second hydroelectric generator operating, which caused an additional 7,000-10,000 cfs of water to be released and thereby caused an addition to the amount released each day during February 2016.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, $50,000 and $75,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the United States District Court in the Eastern District of Louisiana entered a judgment against the defendants, permanently enjoining the defendants from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $150,000 each, and ordering the receiver of the receiver to provide a copy of the judgment to the receiver.  Additionally, the court granted the receiver's request for a temporary restraining order against the receiver, ordering him to return his or her property, and appointing a receiver to deal with any emergency that arises from the flooding.  A hearing on June 5, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time.   The litigation will be led by Daniel A. Davis and supervised by Amy C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern Division of New Orleans and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
