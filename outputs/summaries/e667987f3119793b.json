  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Monroe P. Clayton, who was convicted of first degree murder in the death of Zennia Young.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on January 20, 2017, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Clayton to be barred from appearing or practicing before the court as a defendant.  According to the complaint, Clayton, while on trial for the murder of Young, had his eyes closed and his arms folded over his chest and head down, and he had not taken any notes during the trial. The complaint further alleges that after the trial, Porto was questioned during the questioning of an alternate juror and a sitting juror, and his presence at the questioning was waived by defense counsel. The SEC alleges that Porto's presence was not sufficient to convince the court that he was guilty of the charges, and that he should have been removed immediately after the jury deliberated on the merits of the case.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Porto.  On March 5, 2018, the Honorable Judge Erickson of the U District Court in New Jersey granted the court's request to hold a hearing on the matter. The hearing was scheduled for 4:30 p.m. EST on March 6, 2018. The case was being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Chicago Division of Criminal Investigation. The court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 549, 551, 565, 312 Ill.Dec. 479, 922 N.E.2d 1056.
