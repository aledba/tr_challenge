  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against a Mississippi man accused of molesting a juvenile.  According to the SEC's complaint, Michael Joseph Brooks, Jr., of Dularge, Mississippi, was charged by a jury in February of 2009 with one count of molestation of a juvenile and two counts of aggravated rape.  The complaint alleges that, in 2007, when S.W. was in the first grade, defendant put his finger in her vagina when she was taking a bath.  As alleged in the complaint, defendant had checked her out of school because she was sick; when they got home, defendant made her take a bath, and a few years later, he vaginally raped her.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins Brooks from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Brooks to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  Brooks agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a $10,000 civil penalty against him.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-1806 (Feb. 4, 2019).

Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments using the search tool. \u00c2\u00a0Investigations in this matter are continuing."
