  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Eastern Alliance Insurance Company, LLC (\"Eastern\"), a North Carolina-based insurance company, and its former general counsel, William Senter, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Eastern failed to adequately disclose to Mr. Senter that it had obtained a workers' compensation insurance policy from Eastern.  According to the complaint, the policy provides that an insurance company has the right and duty to defend its claims, and that it has the duty to deal fairly and in good faith with its claims.  For example, the complaint alleges that, after Eastern obtained the policy, it failed to disclose to its general counsel that it did not have the right to settle Mr. H's claim.

It also seeks an officer-and-director bar against Eastern, as well as an officer and director bar against Senter.  Finally, the court will determine whether to impose a conduct-based injunction against Eastern from future violations of Rule 5b-14.  A hearing on May 24, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern and Senter agreed to settle the case without a hearing or approval of the settlement, and Eastern agreed to pay $375,000 in civil penalties and to a $75,000 officer anddirector bar.
