  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Steven Diamond for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 630 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on November 13, 2017, a jury found that defendant\u2019s negligence caused a motor vehicle collision, resulting in various forms of damages.  According to the complaint, Diamond agreed to participate in the voluntary expedited jury trial process without admitting liability or denying her motion for a new trial.  In addition, the court entered a general denial and a cease-and-desist order against Diamond, ordering Diamond to pay $2,450 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, Diamond consented to the entry of a consent order that, in effect since January 2011, the parties had agreed to a mandatory expedited trial process where the jury deliberated for more than one year and four months before deciding whether to award noneconomic damages to the defendant.  As alleged, the consent order expressly prohibits the parties from waiving their right to appeal, and the court granted Diamond a temporary restraining order and an injunction preventing him from violating Section 630. The court also granted Diamond the right to seek a court-ordered injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 13b2-3 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder; and Sections 630.09 and 630.10, subd. (a) and (c) the Administrative Rules of the United States and (d) the Department of Justice and (e) the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2017.  On December 9, 2015, a federal district court in San Diego, California, entered a preliminary injunction against Diamond and ordered him to pay a $2 million civil penalty.  A jury trial followed, and Diamond was found liable by a jury of less than one hundred and twenty-one members for his role in the conduct of the jury. The jury found Diamond liable for a total of $2.4 million in damages. The trial court denied Diamond and his counsel the request for a hearing and ordered Diamond to consent to a hearing that would determine whether to waive his or her rights to appeal. The hearing followed"
