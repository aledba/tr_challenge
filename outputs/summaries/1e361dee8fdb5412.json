  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a temporary restraining order against a California man accused of abusing his wife while she was taking a shower.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, between mid-2017 and mid-2018, respondent and his wife, J, engaged in an aggressive and aggressive pattern of conduct that included, among other things, physical and verbal abuse. The complaint alleges that the respondent and J began spending more nights at the home of their primary caregiver, and that, in the 180 days preceding the filing of the FAPA petition, the respondent allegedly threatened to kill her if she ever left him. According to the complaint, the complaint further alleges that respondent repeatedly confronted her about her husband\u2019s aggressive behavior, which led her to believe that he was trying to run her off the road, risking her life. The SEC also alleges that in one instance, respondent confronted her with a threatening text message, which she replied with, \"Fuck you.\" The SEC alleges that this conduct was consistent with the pattern of abuse that characterized the parties\u2019 relationship, and the fact that, when the parties were together, they had a history of aggressive, aggressive, and aggressive behavior. The court also found that, contrary to what the complaint alleges, respondent did not engage in any aggressive, threatening, or aggressive conduct during the 180-day period before he and J filed for divorce. In addition, the court found that respondent violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On October 5, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the respondent, charging him with violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b2-1 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Kargol."
