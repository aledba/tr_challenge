  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against Evergreen Hospital, LLC, an emergency room nurse at Evergreen, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., on July 26, 2016, Evergreen agreed to settle a class action brought by Jeoung Lee, a registered nurse, alleging that Evergreen denied emergency room nurses their statutorily guaranteed rest and rest breaks.  The complaint alleges that Lee filed a second amended complaint on January 17, 2017, asserting that the CBA expressly waived her ability to bring statutory wage and hour claims in court.  In its judgment, the court held that, as alleged in the SEC complaint, that, on the basis of the arbitration provisions of the federal securities laws, an employee could sue in court to enforce his or her statutory rights in court without having to engage in conduct inconsistent with seeking arbitration, such as actively litigating and passing an obvious opportunity to assert that right.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On August 15, the trial court granted Evergreen a motion to compel arbitration based on the court finding that it had not waived the right to arbitrate, and that it did not have the authority to do so.  Lee has also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and orders her to pay disgorgement of $140,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Lee."
