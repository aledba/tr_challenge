  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against David Gannon, a former AT&T salesperson who was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and failure to control in October 2014.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that Gannon violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Gannon also was found liable for operating under suspension in violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Gannon.  According to the complaint, Gannon agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $750,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions, ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and imposing a $250,000 officer-and-director bar and a $500,000 penalty. The court also ordered Gannon to pay $75,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his penalty. Gannon has also agreed to a $50,000 bar and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of a company or state. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 5, 2018, the court entered a temporary restraining order and issued an order suspending Gannon from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The order also temporarily suspended Gannon's ability to participate in the offering of a penny stock and ordered him to submit to field sobriety tests and the alcohol-breath test.  A hearing scheduled for April 5, 2019, was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio State Highway Patrol in this matter."
