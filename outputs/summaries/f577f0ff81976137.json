  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, alleges that, on or about April 21, 2017, officers from the Oklahoma City Police Department encountered and spoke to a convicted felon who had previously been convicted of a felony. The complaint alleges that the officers confronted the felon with a loaded rifle and asked him to show that he had access to the rifle, which he did not. Instead, the complaint alleges, the officers found the rifle in Mr. Garcia\u2019s waistband.  According to the complaint, as alleged, the defendant immediately became upset and hit his girlfriend with an unknown object, and the officer immediately arrested him.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri today announced criminal charges against the felon.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $75,000. The judgment also imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar for defendants with prior felony convictions, and a 10-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting them from using or selling any firearm. The court also ordered the defendant to pay a $50,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  On the same day, the court issued a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered him to return his allegedly illegal guns to his mother, who was also a victim of a recent domestic violence incident. The judge granted the court's request for an injunction against future violations, ordered a hearing on the merits of the case, and appointed a receiver to determine whether to issue a civil injunctive relief. The receiver will determine the amount of monetary relief that will be provided to the receiver. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oklahoma State Attorney General's Office, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Criminal Justice Department Criminal Investigations Division and the Oklahoma Department of Banking and Securities and Exchange Commission."
