  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against defendant Ricardo A. Garcia, Jr., a member of the Sure\u00f1os 13 street gang, finding him liable for the murders of two other members of the gang.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boone County, Illinois, alleges that, on November 29, 2013, Garcia drove a Chevrolet Impala to a house party in Belvidere, Illinois.  According to the complaint, Garcia told one of the men that he wanted to \"get at somebody\" and \"hit that n*** in the face.\"  The complaint further alleges that Garcia followed the two men into the car and fired multiple shots at the car, causing the car to spin out of control and hit the driver's side of the car.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Garcia for the same conduct that led to Garcia's conviction.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Garcia consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Garcia has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  On March 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Robert A. Hannan granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order against Garcia, ordering him to surrender his passport, and imposing a $1,500 civil penalty against him.  Judge Hannan also granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against Garcia and a conduct-based injunction against him from further violations of Section 5 of the Criminal Code of 1933.  Hannan will be sentenced at a later date to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5/5-2(c).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Missouri State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
