  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two Nassau County officers for their roles in a domestic violence case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on March 8, 2013, Scott Tolchin and his wife Heidi Tolchin were hosting a party for their 14-year old daughter at their home in Merrick, New York. As alleged in the complaint, Tolchin confronted several of the children outside the house, was very upset, was ranting and slurring her words, and was yelling at the children.  The complaint alleges that shortly after receiving the summons, the defendants confronted Tolchin, who was not in uniform and did not wear a badge.  Tolchin allegedly told the children that he believed she was a detective or police officer during the incident, and advised them to go home and call the police, if she wanted, to which Tolchin replied \u201cI am the police.\u201d  The SEC alleges that Tolchin did not respond to the complaints and instead simply let go of the phone.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Tolchin.  On May 26, 2014, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the U.N. Division of Justice issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the court as part of a case-by-case review.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (\"Advisers\"), and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The final judgments also order the defendants to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and order them to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Additionally, the court will determine whether to issue an officer-and-director bar against each of the defendants based on the merits of the complaint.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 12(b)(5) No. 206 (2d Cir. 2009).  The Court granted the defendants' requests for an injunction, an order appointing a receiver, and the appointment of a receiver to assist with the investigation of the matter. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott Vaher, Brent M. Ben\u2013Sorek, and Timothy B."
