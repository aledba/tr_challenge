  "summary": "On May 9, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Paula Scher, a nationally known graphic designer, and her company, Stendhal Gallery, Inc., for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that Scher, who was Scher's exclusive agent, created a series of acrylic-on-canvas paintings known as the Map I and Map II paintings.  According to the complaint, Scher and the Gallery entered into an oral agreement that provided for the consignment and sale of the prints, and that, upon entering into the oral agreement, Scher was entitled to the full list price for the prints and to a 50% commission on the sale of those prints.  As alleged, however, Scher had no contractual relationship with the artist, never made any payment to the art merchant, and never had possession or control of the unsold prints as physical objects.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, when Scher signed the final judgment, she did so as an agent and as a fiduciary, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Scher also consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of Section 12.01 of the Exchange Act, and orders her to pay a $45,000 civil penalty.  On May 11, 2010, the court granted Scher's motion for partial summary judgment against the Gallery, and ordered Scher to pay $15,000 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, with the amount of the civil penalty to be determined by the court at a later date.  After Scher agreed to settle the case, the Court granted the Gallery's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered the payment of a civil penalty of $45 million, and issued an order suspending Scher from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Following the court's order, Scher agreed not to participate in the SEC's investigation of the matter and to the appointment of an independent receiver to determine whether to proceed with a civil proceeding against her.  To settle the matter, Scher also agreed to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any artworks for the purpose of exhibition and sale, and to be entitled to an accounting of any proceeds from sales of the artworks that the Gallery might otherwise have to recover from the sale.  Finally, Scher consented, after the fact, to the issuance of an order prohibiting her from serving as an officer or director of a public company and ordering the purchase, sale, or alteration of any artwork."
