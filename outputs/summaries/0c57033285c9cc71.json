  "summary": "On May 29, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of felony kidnapping in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that, while living in Vietnam, the defendant entered the home with two children with a Vietnamese woman, a girl, S.L., and a boy, P.L.  According to the complaint, the defendants were not permitted to enter the home at the time of the kidnapping and instead waited outside the home to alert the foster mother, who was chasing the defendant.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant for his role in the alleged kidnapping.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed on March 1, 2013 and unsealed today, the criminal charges were based on the defendant's own testimony, which placed him in the felony category of \"breaking and entering\" with the intent to commit the felony of parental kidnapping, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7\u201926A, and the lesser included offense of aggravated parental kidnapping. The SEC alleges that the defendant failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had a right to the full and complete custody of the children and that he was pursuing them in the pending custody proceedings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the case filed in U. S. District court for the district of Connecticut, the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendant to surrender his passport and other documents.  On June 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged scheme to steal children from their homes.  To learn more about parental kidnapping and how to spot it, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (2014).  The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  For further information, see Commonwealth v. McCreary, 387 Mass. 671, 676-677, 393 N.E.2d 546."
