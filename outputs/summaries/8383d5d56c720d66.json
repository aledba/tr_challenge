  "summary": "On June 28, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the New York State Attorney General's Office (AGO) for failing to provide timely and accurate information to the AGO about the treatment and retention of psychiatric patients.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that the Attorney General has failed to comply with his or her duty as an attorney to protect the rights of the institutionalized mentally disabled.  According to the complaint, from at least 2013 through at least 2016, Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and AGO failed to provide an AGO with a copy of a patient's medical chart before any retention hearing.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a matter of due process, the attorney's ability to personally inspect the medical charts at retention hearings is not sufficient to guarantee the accuracy of the medical testimony presented at those retention hearings.  As a result, the court's order to disgorge ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, impose a civil penalty, and require the attorney to pay disgorgement of $1,078, which would be offset by an attorney's monetary penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the AGDO has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a $10,000 civil penalty in the amount of $20,000, which is equal to the amount that BPC has already paid to the attorney representing the client in this matter.  On June 26, 2018, the Court granted the AGSO's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered an accounting, and issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the collection and storage of medical records in the state's mental health facilities, and ordered the AG to provide a copy to the court.   The AGDO's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Rizzo and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Manhattan Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the AttorneyGeneral's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Office of Inspector General of Criminal Investigations."
