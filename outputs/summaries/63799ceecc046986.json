  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against a defendant in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, in March 1996, the decedent and his wife, Christine Svenningsen, created two irrevocable trusts for the benefit of their adopted daughter, Emily and Emily.  According to the complaint, Emily's adoption was not disclosed to the court until Christine's death in May 1997.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Emily was not included as a beneficiary under the trusts because she was not a \"person entitled or allegedly entitled\" to share in the estate with her biological father.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Emily had no interest in the trusts at the time she was adopted and was not entitled to the right to be an \"adopted-out\" child.  Instead, the court found that Emily's interests in the trust were vested prior to her being adopted by her biological family.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against the defendants. The final judgments also order the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2,136, which is equal to the amounts of the defendants' assets.  On May 8, 2016, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia entered final judgments against Christine and her husband in Matter of Best, which enjoins Christine from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and orders Christine to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The court also ordered Christine to account as an \"assessor\" of the trust and to provide an accounting of the trustees' entire estate.  Christine agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently restrains her from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act and orders her to pay $1.5 million in restitution. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Central District of Connecticut."
