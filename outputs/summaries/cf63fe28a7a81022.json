  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against electronics retailer Newegg.com for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that, under the federal securities laws, a person can and does have standing to sue a company for making or selling a product that they believe is worth less than what they paid for it.  According to the complaint, Hansen has relied on fictitious former price information in making two purchases from Newegg, and has paid more for the product than he would have been willing to pay had he known the false former price representations were true.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Hansen has not suffered any economic injury because he had not relied on the fictitious former prices representations when purchasing the products.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed under Section 17204 of the federal Securities Act of 1933, Hansen is entitled to a permanent injunction, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, sale, or promotion of any product.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Newegg consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Newegg also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000, which is equal to the amount that it has already paid to settle a civil action brought by the SEC in this matter.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the California Office of Insurance Regulation (OIO)."
