  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Dustin Lawrence, a Hamilton, Ohio man who was convicted of four felony counts of domestic violence, gross sexual imposition, kidnapping with a sexual purpose and three counts of rape.  According to the court's order, Lawrence filed a brief pursuant to Anders v. California, in which the court found that the duty of a court-appointed appellate counsel to prosecute a first appeal from a criminal conviction is not mandatory.  The court also found that counsel should file a merit brief when counsel has conscientiously determined there is no merit to the defendant's appeal.  In addition, the court ruled that counsel could not bring or defend an appeal when counsel finds no reasonable basis for the defendant to withdraw.  As a result, Lawrence was sentenced to consecutive 11-year prison terms, to run concurrently to the rape convictions, for an aggregate of 33 years.  Lawrence also was found guilty on all of the charges and sentenced to five years postrelease control and a five-year post-release control.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Anders brief, Lawrence consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil monetary penalties.  On August 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan entered a judgment against Lawrence, ordering him to consent to a permanent injunction against future violations, ordering a conduct-based injunction, and requiring him to submit a written opinion in the matter of a hearing before the court. The judgment also ordered Lawrence to submit to an independent review of the record that would determine whether the merits of his appeal are worth pursuing. The court granted Lawrence's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered him to comply with a court order, and appointed a receiver to assist him with the filing of an Anders brief. The receiver was not permitted to respond to a call for an emergency court order or to provide assistance in the case of an emergency.   In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Lawrence. The SEC's Office of Criminal Investigations and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office have issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigation Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage defendants to check the background of anyone filing an emergency action with the SEC.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
