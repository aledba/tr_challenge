  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Air America Flight Center, LLC, a Florida-based limited liability company, against Sandhills and Sherwood, who are charged with misappropriating trade secrets from Air America.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, from at least 2005 through at least 2014, Air America violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, in addition to the alleged breach of duty of loyalty, the complaint alleges that Air America misappropriated trade secrets related to Air America's policies and procedures for screening and training pilots, and that Sherwood used the stolen trade secrets to perform services for a New York-based company.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Sherwood and Air America for their roles in the alleged theft and misuse of trade secrets.  On February 8, 2019, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Air America from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar in the amount of $100,000.  It also ordered Air America to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and to pay an officer and director bar in connection with the alleged violations of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  Air America has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction, which is subject to the court's approval.   The court also granted the company's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The Court's order, which was entered without prejudice to the other defendants, reserves the right to determine whether to proceed with a judgment imposing permanent injunctions, imposing a $50,000 penalty and ordering the company to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.
