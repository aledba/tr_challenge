  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Matthew L. Leili, Jr., a convicted felon, for his role in the July 2011 disappearance of his wife, Dominique Leili.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that, on July 8, 2011, Appellant and his ex-wife, Joanne Lucey, went to the Leili residence and had a verbal altercation when they returned home in the early morning hours of July 9, 2011. According to the complaint, after learning that his wife had been reported missing, he allegedly sought and obtained approximately twelve search warrants during the course of their investigation of Dominique's murder. The complaint alleges that the search warrants all flowed from the Georgia and Vermont searches and involved only the search of the home and the two follow-up warrants, which were issued the day before and executed the same day. The SEC alleges that in the weeks leading up to the alleged murder, the couple had threatened to kill each other if they tried to leave with their children. The court found no reasonable cause for the search warrant to be issued, and the court granted the motion for a temporary restraining order, a court order, and an officer-and-director bar. The Court also granted the request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and a civil injunctive relief order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Leili based on the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, Patrick J. McCluskey, and Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Georgia State Attorney General's Office, the New York Police Department, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the United States Postal Inspection Service (FINSA), and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in this matter."
