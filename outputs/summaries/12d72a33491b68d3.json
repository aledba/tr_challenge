  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Camilo Andres Landazuri Vargas, who pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine, in violation of the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (MDLEA) and the Jury Trial Clause.  According to the court's order, Vargas consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the MDLEA and the jury trial provision of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment and a $75,000 civil penalty.  The court also granted Vargas\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations.  On December 21, 2018, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Vargas and ordered him to surrender his passport and return to the United States.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that they have issued an order suspending or freezing Vargas from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any drug, including, but not limited to, the manufacture and sale of a controlled substance, such as amphetamine, heroin, and marijuana.  Vargas has also agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and will be prohibited from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions and ordering them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $5,000, $10,000 in disgorgement, and $1,500 in prejudgment interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Lara S. Mehraban. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the United Kingdom Attorney General's Office, and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in this matter."
