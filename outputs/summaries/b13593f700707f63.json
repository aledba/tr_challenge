  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a Florida-based medical malpractice defendant.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that defendant Frank Paterno sought out and initiated contact with LSI, a surgical facility specializing in spine surgery, after he was solicited in New York by a New York resident and professional golfer, and received an email from LSI stating that he could take the open spot and have the surgery performed at a significant discount.  According to the complaint, however, as alleged in the SEC's Complaint, plaintiff was in severe pain following the first two Florida surgeries, and sought a medical assessment of his condition at the time.  In addition, the complaint alleges that plaintiff had not shown any signs of distress following the second Florida surgery, despite the fact that many of his doctors were New York residents and conducted their healthcare activities solely in Connecticut.  Additionally, the SEC alleges that defendants' pre- and post-surgery contacts with New York-based doctors were insufficient to establish that LSI was transacting business within the meaning of the federal due process provision of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and failed to establish whether LSI had personal jurisdiction over defendants under Section 302 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Complaint and the SEC, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering them to pay civil penalties of $10,000 and $20,000, respectively.  On May 30, 2008, the court granted a request for a temporary restraining order and ordered LSI to cease and desist from making material misrepresentations to the SEC in its Complaint.  A hearing on June 9, 2010, was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  An SEC examination that followed the examination that led to the discovery of the SEC complaint, which was conducted in the New York Regional Office, found that the SEC had no jurisdiction over LSI and that defendants had not engaged in any transaction of business outside New York.  As a result, LSI has not been able to determine whether it has a duty of care to its patients or to its agents or employees, and the court has not issued an order imposing a civil injunctive relief order.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against LSI. "
