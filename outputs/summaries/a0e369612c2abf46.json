  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against Appellee for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Appelllee for failing to pay the twenty percent (20%) interest owed under the Agreement regarding the Farm Property and Rental Property.  According to the court's order, Appellant and his business entity, 50 West Conestoga Road, LP, agreed to partition of the farm property and the Rental property so the parties could sell the properties, pay the expenses of the sales, and equitably divide the net proceeds of the sale.  Appelle also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $20,000, which is equal to the amount owed in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the parties agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains the parties' obligations under the federal securities laws and requires them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Pennsylvania today announced parallel criminal charges against Appelmanlee.  On August 7, 2017, the court issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to proceed with the partition action.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Mark Provenzano and supervised by Marc Blau of the Philadelphia Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Office of Financial Regulation."
