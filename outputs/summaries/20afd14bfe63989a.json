  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Island Medical Physicians, P.C., a New York-based medical device company, and two of its affiliated companies in an emergency room case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, on March 4, 2009, former resident Lorraine A. Walsh sought treatment at South Nassau Communities Hospital.  According to the complaint, Walsh sought medical care at the hospital, where she was administered Dilaudid, an opioid narcotic pain-killer, and Ativan, a benzodiazepine drug, without warning her of the dangers of the medication administered to her.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that the medication defendants gave to Walsh either impaired or could impair her ability to safely operate an automobile.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending the suspension of the Island Medical defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of an ongoing investigation.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Island Medical consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Island Medical to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $1,500.  Island Medical also agreed to pay a $500,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization for a period of five years.  On May 9, 2016, the Honorable Judge Robert A. Purdy of the U District Court in Manhattan entered a judgment ordering a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering a preliminary injunction against further violations, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against the Defendants.  A hearing on May 11, 2016 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Insurance Regulatory Surveillance Authority.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 24, 2016)."
