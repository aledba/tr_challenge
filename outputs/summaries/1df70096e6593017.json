  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against Floyd Sandoval, a convicted felon, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, alleges that Sandoval violated his constitutional right to due process when it declined to instruct the jury in accordance with Rosemond v. United States, 572 U. S. 65, 134 S.Ct. 1240, 188 L.Ed.2d 248 (2014), that an alleged felony murder complicitor must know in advance of the occurrence of the predicate felony that another participant intends to commit.  According to the complaint, Sandoval agreed to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Sandoval also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any type of criminal proceeding.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Sandoval for his role in the alleged scheme.   The court also ordered Sandoval to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar in the amount of $1,000,000.  Without admitting to the SEC's findings, the defendants agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $2,000 and $1 million, respectively, for each of the charged violations. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Department of Criminal Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
