  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Iowa today entered a final judgment against Briand Daniel Fechner, who was convicted of possession of child pornography in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Des Moines, Iowa, alleges that Fekner violated Rule 403 of the federal securities laws by failing to disclose to the jury that he had access to thousands of thousands of images of adult men engaging in sexual activity with minors on his phone and SD card.  According to the complaint, the defendants allegedly shared the images on their phones and SD cards with one another in an effort to conceal the images from the jury.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York today announced criminal charges against FechNER.  Fechners has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Rule 403, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, he consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Rule 403 and ordering him to comply with the court order.  He also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney and to be enjoined from future securities law violations.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation in this matter.  For further information, see SEC v. Vosburgh, 518 F.3d 597, 605 (8th Cir. 2010).  The complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order, an injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and an officer and director bar.
