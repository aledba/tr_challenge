  "summary": "On June 4, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Elliott Broidy, the former chief executive officer and chairman of the Republican National Committee, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, in late 2017 and early 2018, the state of Qatar, believing Broidy to be an influential detractor responsible for President Trump's public criticism of Qatar in June 2017, engineered a cyberattack in order to discredit him and curtail his influence.  According to the complaint, in a response brief filed in support of the motion to dismiss, Broidy allegedly stated in a summary paragraph at the end of his opposition that he was entitled to discovery.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Benomar had served as a secret Qatari agent since at least 2017 and that he had been paid by Qatar to participate in the alleged Qatari hacking scheme.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, that the defendants failed to meet their burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that an exception to diplomatic immunity applies and that jurisdiction exists, the court improperly granted the defendants the right to proceed with their litigation without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  On June 5, 2019 the Hon Hai Precision Indus. Co. v. State Oil Co. of Azer. Republic, 582 F.3d 393, 401 (2d Cir. 2009).  The court granted the Defendants\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against them from participating in any action or proceeding under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, and a civil penalty of $150,000.  Broidy has agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for the purpose of recovering stolen documents from the agency.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-02421-JFW-E (Dec. 2015).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Broidy. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free"
