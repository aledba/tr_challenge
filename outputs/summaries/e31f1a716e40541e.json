  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a domestic battery case, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that James King was not in compliance with the court's finding of potential harm when he was removed from the custody of his mother, Teilor Lybrand, after she was arrested on a felony battery charge.  According to the complaint, King had been incarcerated when Lybrand was released from prison, and the court found that King was in violation of Section 5 of the federal securities laws.  In its order, the court also terminated King's parental rights based on a finding by the court that he had violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, King consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating Section 5 and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from participating in the securities industry.  King also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be permanently enjoined from violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule\u00c2\u00a0206(4)-8 thereunder, and that he will be permanently barred from associating with any person with a history of domestic violence.  On May 25, 2017, a federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, entered a temporary restraining order against King, ordering him to comply with the order, and barring him from appearing before the court as an attorney or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review.   The court also issued an order suspending King's right to reapply for a hearing in the future on the same day as the hearing.  A hearing on May 26, 2018, was scheduled for 6:30 p.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Arkansas, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the FBI, the Missouri Department of Children and Families, the Alabama Department of Corrections, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Mississippi Department of Banking and Securities, the Kentucky Department of Insurance, the Tennessee Department of Education, the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the Florida Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Virginia Department of State Attorney General's Office and the Alabama Division of Criminal Justice."
