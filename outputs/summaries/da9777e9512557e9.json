  "summary": "On September 13, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana entered summary judgment against a husband and wife who entered into a postnuptial agreement without valid consideration.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, on June 1, 1976, George A. Buskirk, a law school graduate, and wife of the same name, filed a civil injunctive action against each of them for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, as a matter of law, the parties did not consider dissolving their marriage at any time and that, at the time they entered into the agreement, they did not contemplate the dissolution of their marriage as a result of their disagreement.  As alleged in the complaint, in light of these disclosures, Husband and Wife agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay $10,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In addition, the court granted the husband's motion for summary judgment and ordered him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the Buskirs agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay attorney fees in the amount of $100,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  On August 18, 2016 the court held a hearing in favor of the husband, and granted him summary judgment on the same day.  After the hearing, the wife and Husband discussed ending the marriage.  She consented to the judgment by consent, and the court entered a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, ordering her to pay, on a joint and several basis, $1.5 million in civil penalties and $10 million in attorney fees.  Husband also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and ordered to pay an amount equal to the amount owed to him by the parties in the civil injunctions proceeding against him.  Finally, the Court granted Husband's request for a preliminary injunction against future violations and ordered that he pay a civil penalty of $20,000, which is equal to any other penalty imposed by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is pending"
