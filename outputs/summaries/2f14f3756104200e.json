  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of escape from a penal institution for failing to report to the jail.  According to the court's order, on October 31, 2012, defendant Elizabeth M. Clark, who has a history of alcohol and substance abuse, entered into a guilty plea and was subsequently sentenced to 30 months in prison.  The court found that Clark violated the antifraud provisions of Section 31-6(a) of the Criminal Code of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The Court also found that the defendants violated the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  In its judgment, the court held that defendants were not in custody when they failed to report, that they had been released on bond, and that the court had the exclusive discretion to determine whether to charge them with an additional felony.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits. The court also granted the defendants' motion for leave to appeal.  On November 2, 2017, the Honorable Kathleen M. Burns of the United States District Court in Chicago issued a temporary restraining order against Clark, ordering her to surrender her passport, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Corrections, and the Illinois State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
