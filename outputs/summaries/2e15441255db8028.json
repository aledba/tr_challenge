  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Washington today entered a final judgment against defendant Arnold Cruz for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, Washington, alleges that Cruz was charged with rendering criminal assistance to a person who had committed or was being sought for any class A felony.  According to the complaint, Cruz consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and a $20,000 officer-and-director bar.  In its order, the court also ordered Cruz to surrender himself to law enforcement, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  On December 17, 2015, in the County of Kitsap, State of Washington, Cruz pleaded guilty to the charges and was sentenced to 151 months in prison. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Cruz, ordered him to surrender, and issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The order also prohibits Cruz from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of securities, including securities in the securities industry, and prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company or association with a broker-dealer. In addition, the order requires Cruz to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Cruz. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the return of the defendant's allegedly stolen motor vehicle.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 578-79, March 24, 2018.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Hershfang. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Seattle Police Department, the Federal Housing Finance Authority, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Federal Office of Inspector General (OIGA) in this matter."
