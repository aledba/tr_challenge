  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered final judgments in a civil injunctive action against two licensed medical providers for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boca Raton, Florida, alleges that Robert W. Otto, a licensed marriage and family therapist, and Julie H. Hamilton, a registered representative of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Florida, violated the First Amendment by failing to comply with the federal laws that prohibit the practice of conversion therapy.  According to the complaint, Otto and Hamilton agreed to settle the case by agreeing to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal anti-bullying laws, as well as requiring them to do.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to permanent injunctions, to be subject to reasonable and strict scrutiny, and to pay civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the two licensed therapists.  To learn more about conversion therapy, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2017.  For more information on conversion therapy and its related issues, see Press Release No-1-2017-11-20.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order, which temporarily enjoins the defendants from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Robert E. Birkenheier. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Florida Office of Inspector General, and the Florida Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
