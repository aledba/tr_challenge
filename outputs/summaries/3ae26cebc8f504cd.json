  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against prison officials for defrauding an inmate out of more than $1 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, alleges that, in 2002, Dooley was tried for five felony counts of attempted murder, five counts of aggravated assault, and reckless endangerment of another person. The complaint also alleges that the DOC officials were deliberately indifferent to Dooley\u2019s serious mental health needs and did not consider the fact that he required D Stability Code treatment at the time of his initial incarceration. In addition, the complaint alleges that Dooley failed to adequately state a claim that he was not severely mentally disabled, despite having been found guilty but mentally ill by the jury.  Dooley also alleged that DOC officials ignored his repeated complaints about inadequate mental health treatment and failed to respond to his repeated requests to amend the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Dooley.  According to the SEC's order, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The court also ordered Dooley to comply with the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,253,078, plus prejudgment interest of $2,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Department of Corrections and the Attorney General's Office today announced that it has issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee Dooley's case. The receiver has agreed to the appointment of a receiver and to the payment of a $50,000 civil penalty, which will be determined by the receiver upon motion of the court.
