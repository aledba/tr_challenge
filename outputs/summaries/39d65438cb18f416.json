  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment in favor of a Houston man who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that Jason Ramjattansingh was arrested without probable cause on May 9, 2015, while on the way to the scene of a DWI arrest. According to the complaint, the defendant told the tow truck driver that he had almost hit other vehicles and had almost caused multiple accidents. The complaint further alleges that Ramjattsingh told the driver that, when he was arrested, he had \"some shots of alcohol\" and \"couldn't stand still.\" The complaint alleges that, after the arrest, the driver began to sob and was unable to hold his head still. The court also ruled that, based on the evidence presented to the jury at the time the arrest took place, the jury should have been able to determine whether the defendant was adequately warned of his rights and had reasonable suspicion to detain him until the trial judge arrived and conducted her investigation.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against the defendant.  On May 10, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court for the Central District of California against Ramjattaansinghe. The SEC charged the defendant with violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and charged him with violating Sections 9(a)(1) and 9(b)(5)(A) and (c) thereunder, and with aiding and abetting the defendant's violations of Section 5. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17, July 17, 2018.   The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Houston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by David A. Oursbourn and supervised by Amy S. Cotter. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Department of Public Safety, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
