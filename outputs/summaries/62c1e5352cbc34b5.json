  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Nevada today entered a final judgment against Robert Guerrina, a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for robbery and kidnapping.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Las Vegas, Nevada, alleges that, on three separate occasions over the course of a single day, Guerrine, a former FastBucks employee, attempted to steal money from the store and demanded that Cuevas accompany him into the store. The complaint further alleges that the defendant entered into a verbal agreement that he would require a continuance if he were to be convicted of the two felony counts. Guerrin allegedly agreed to the continuance without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, and agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Guerrinas. The SEC previously issued an order suspending the registration of a \"deadly weapon\" and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty. The court's order temporarily enjoins the defendant from violating these provisions and orders him to return to the country where he was arrested and sentenced to a prison term of 2-15 years.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court of Appeals granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, and granted the defendant the right to reapply after five years of incarceration. The Court also granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a civil injunction, which is subject to court approval. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Las Vegas Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Nevada Department of Justice, the FBI, the Nevada State Bureau of Investigation, and the Nevada Attorney General's Office."
