  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Beverage Holdings, L.L.C., a company that owns and operates a preschool and daycare center franchise in Independence, Ohio.  According to the court's order, filed on April 29, 2011, the parties entered into agreements for the sale of a real property in Ohio that provided for a credit for all rents paid between the start of the lease and the closing of the transaction.  The court found that, under their interpretation, the credit provision was absurd, and that, in fact, it resulted in a manifest absurdity.  In its judgment, the court held that the plain language of the Rents Credit provided that the credit should be applied only to the purchase price at the time of closing, not just the amount of rent paid during the closing.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the judgment, Beverage and the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the parties from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the parties to pay disgorgement of $462,500 plus prejudgment interest of $1,726, and a civil penalty of $12,500 per month.  Beverage also agreed to pay a $20,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The judgment also prohibits the defendants from acting as unregistered broker-dealers or purchasing or selling any real property for any purpose other than to make a profit on the purchase of the property. \u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 10, 2017, the U. S. District Judge in the Western Division of the United Kingdom granted a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest and pay civil penalties in the amounts of $2.5 million and $12 million, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date in the same administrative proceeding.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Alexander. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Department of Banking and Securities, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
