  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, filed on October 26, 2015, the defendant had agreed to accept a lump sum payment of $34,971, as well as a $240,000 structured settlement, as his attorney's fee in a case on which he worked from January 2004 through January 2013.  The court also found that the defendant was entitled to a separate property credit in the sum of $200,000 for the separate funds used to purchase the subject real property.  In addition, the court found that only $100,000 of the defendant's income for purposes of determining maintenance was entitled as a one-time bonus, and that the other $10,442.91 would be distributed to the defendant as a proportionate share of the income of the parties' then 13-year-old child.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay a civil penalty of $65,114.81, and orders the defendant to pay disgorgement of $1,038,768, plus prejudgment interest of $2,065, and a civil monetary penalty of 10% of the amount of the defendants' respective retirement accounts. The judgment also prohibits the defendant from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock. The court granted the defendants a temporary restraining order, ordered the defendants to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, and ordered the parties to pay civil penalties of $160,000 each. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing on the settlement is scheduled for May 26, 2016.  On May 24, 2016, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the New York Court of Appeals entered a judgment against the defendant, ordering him to pay $150,000 as attorney's fees and $20,000 to be distributed as a portion of his retirement account. The SEC's order also ordered the court to consider the merits of the settlement, including whether it was reasonable to expect the settlement to be approved by the court at a later date. The case was supervised by C.J. Birkenheier. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy S. Cotter."
