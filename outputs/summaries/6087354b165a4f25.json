  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against a DeRidder, Louisiana man accused of orchestrating a double murder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on March 24, 2016, James Bethard of Beauregard Parish, Louisiana, entered Dee's Motel and found Ms. Ortego lying face down on the floor and covered in blood.  According to the complaint, Mr. Bethard entered the Motel room and saw a woman lying on the ground with blood on her face and hands.  He then entered the room and confronted the woman, who he believed was his girlfriend, and asked her to leave the room so he could have a cigarette.  As alleged, the woman left the room without saying a word to him and continued to text him.  After she left, the complaint alleges, the next morning, Bethard and Mr. Jantzen entered the motel room and found the woman in the room, who had been drinking heavily and had a history of domestic violence.  She was later found dead in her room.  In a parallel criminal case, the U. S. Attorney for the Central District of Mississippi today filed criminal charges in the case against Bethard.  On March 25, 2016 and April 1, 2017, the SEC charged Bethard with first-degree murder for his role in a double-murder that took place in the motel's parking lot.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against him for a period of five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott Greenum, Mark Herford, and Amy Gwiazda of the New Orleans Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Louisiana Department of Criminal Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Department of Banking and Securities and Investments in the Commission's Office of Criminal Investigations."
