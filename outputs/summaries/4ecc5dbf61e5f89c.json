  "summary": "On February 9, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California entered a final judgment in favor of the three officers who were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in El Segundo, Calif., Janelle Perez was terminated on September 4, 2012. The complaint alleges that Perez engaged in conduct that was not consistent with the department's policies and that included making personal phone calls to a married officer while on duty. Perez also allegedly engaged in on-the-job conduct that impacted her ability to perform her duties while responding to calls for service.  The complaint further alleges that one of the officers had engaged in an ongoing extramarital relationship with another officer while she was on duty, resulting in a written reprimand for Perez.  Perez and Begley both consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Perez. The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a securities firm.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see SEC's Complaint Bulletin No. 598 (January 9, 2012).  The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people applying to be a police officer by using the\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also use the Investor Alert to quickly spot signs of suspicious activity."
