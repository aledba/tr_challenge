  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against Big City Acquisitions, LLC and its owner, Big City Realty Management, LLC, in a class action action brought by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants engaged in a scheme to inflate rents over and above the amounts defendants were legally permitted to charge.  As alleged, defendants inflated rents by falsely reporting to the Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) that leases were rent-controlled pursuant to the J\u201351 program, when in fact those contracts were free-market compacts.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to register rental information as required by state and city law, thereby rendering it impossible to calculate the correct legal regulated rent on apartments that exit rent control status, by recording a rent price significantly higher than the preferential rent actually charged with certain units.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively, in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the class action provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review that was conducted by the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, including the Division's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy (OIEA).  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Financial Regulation today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged violations of Section 9 of the Exchange Act and Rule 9b2-1.  OIEA has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Kasper and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office."
