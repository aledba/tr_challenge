  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Temple University Health System, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania hospital that was acquired by the university in 1910. The court found that judicial estoppel applies only to assertions of fact rather than law or legal theory. The Court also found that, in 2005, the University of Pennsylvania obtained a court order certifying the hospital as the collective bargaining representative of a larger unit of professional and technical employees at the university. According to the court's order, the hospital had previously sought the PLRB's certification of the technical-professional unit, and the court had agreed that the unit was appropriate for collective bargaining. However, the Court found that the hospital was not entitled to the jurisdiction of the federal district court for the southern district of New Hampshire, and that the court did not have jurisdiction over the hospital.  The court also ruled that, based upon its understanding of the Court\u2019s finding, the court should not have granted the hospital a court-ordered injunction, which would have prevented the hospital from violating the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against the hospital arising from the same conduct alleged in New Hampshire v. Maine. The SEC previously issued an order requiring the hospital to comply with the court order, which it did not comply with.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the university and the hospital agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-05-E (Jan. 21, 2019).  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Health and Human Services in this matter."
