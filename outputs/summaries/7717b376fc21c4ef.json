  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against Wendy Johnson, a former Administrative Services Assistant V at Wilkes Correctional Center, for failing to comply with the agency\u2019s burden-shifting framework in determining a claim of alleged discrimination on the basis of sex.  The court found that Johnson failed to meet her burden of proof by failing to show that she had a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not being selected for the position of salary administration specialist and assistant manager of WFREO.  According to the court, Johnson was the only woman interviewed for the job and received an overall score of \u201cabove average.\u201d The court also ruled that Johnson had a high school education and had 150 months of experience in State government.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Department of Justice today announced that it was accepting applications for a vacant position at the Western Foothills Regional Employment Office (WFREO).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Charlotte, North Carolina, charges Johnson with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Johnson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $42,159, a 10% increase from her current salary, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 24, 2019).  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that Johnson violated Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 15a-14, and that she violated Section 17(a) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") and Rule 206(2)-8 thereunder (Adviser Act), Johnson violated Sections 206(1), 206 (2), and 206(4)-8 of the Exchange Act and Rules 206(3) and 206 (4)-7 thereunder. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against future violations and a penalty from the Commission on Civil and Administrative Rights, as well as from the Attorney General of the United States, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Internal Revenue Service."
