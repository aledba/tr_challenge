  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida on September 12, 2019 entered a final judgment against Traeger Grills, LLC (\"Traeger\"), a Florida-based company that manufactures and sells wood pellet grills and grill accessories.  According to the court's order, Traeger and its founder, Joe Traeger, created the Traeger Barn, which is named in the company's trademark applications.  The court found, on balance, that the names and likenesses of Joe and Brian Traeger constituted fair use, and that Traeger had exclusive rights to the mark.  In addition, the court found that, as a result of Traeger's non-compliance with the federal registration provisions of the federal trademark laws, the company is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the event of a court finding that it has violated those provisions.  Traeger also has agreed to pay $9,000,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order filed in federal court in Phoenix, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay a civil monetary penalty of $3,402,122.  Dansons has also agreed to be barred from associating with any third party in connection with the advertising, marketing, or sale of Wood pellet grill products.  On September 20, 2018, the Court granted a motion for preliminary injunction and ordered Traeger to post a cease-and-desist letter on its social media accounts.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Jordan Thiessen, Jordan Strama, and Eric Werner and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Mr. Strama and Ms. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Florida Office of Patent and Trademark Regulation."
