  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against a Georgia man accused of orchestrating a multi-pronged drug distribution scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that, from approximately 2010 through 2012, a group of individuals, with one named Curtis Donaldson at the center, agreed to work together to distribute cocaine and crack cocaine to their overlapping customer bases. According to the complaint, Mr. Toombs and others took on various and shifting roles in fulfilling the necessary tasks, including lending money to each other to purchase drugs from suppliers, going to suppliers and purchasing drugs, and cooking and selling drugs. The complaint alleges that he engaged in significant drug-distribution activity with Mr. Donaldson and others, including, among other things, selling his drugs for his own and his friend\u2019s benefit, warning him of law enforcement officers nearby, and buying drugs from other individuals with the intent to resell them. The SEC alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Toombs consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and bars him from participating in any future offering of the drug. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Department today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against Donaldson, charging him with violating Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson under the supervision of Chedly C. Dumornay."
