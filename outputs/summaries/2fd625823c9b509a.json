  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant in a civil action brought by a former partner in the Three Wine Guys, Inc.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbia, Missouri, alleges that Gregory Kinsey failed to request attorney's fees from a defendant until after this court issued its mandate in Clark II.  According to the complaint, Kinsey filed a motion for summary judgment in the amount of $25,000, including attorney\u2019s fees, on June 3, 2011, alleging damages due to a breach of the Shareholders\u2019 Agreement and failing to reimburse Clark and Mantia for the portion of the fees he owed.  Kinsey also alleges that he failed to file a counterclaim in the August 2011 petition, which the trial court granted without prejudice.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Kinsey did not file a response and affirmative defense to his motion for a summary judgment against Clark, and failed to present a claim for attorney\u2018s fees in his pleadings or by motion to the court prior to the mandate.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Kinsey to pay $75,000 in disgorgement, $25 million in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $50,000.   The court also granted Kinsey a temporary restraining order, barring him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and ordering him to pay civil penalties of $20,000 each.  Finally, the court issued a subpoena for a copy of the subpoena, which was obtained by the SEC through an SEC complaint filed in the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Missouri. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
