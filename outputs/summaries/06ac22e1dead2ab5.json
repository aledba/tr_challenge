  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming today entered a final judgment against a defendant who pled guilty to ten felony counts of making false statements in Medicaid claims.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Wyoming on December 18, 2015, Lisa L. Mellott, a registered nurse and a Medicaid provider, was charged with ten felony violations of Wyo. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 42-4-111(a) and (b)(i) of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of her guilty plea, the state improperly aggregated multiple Medicaid claims by client to create a felony charge for a false claim in excess of $500. The complaint further alleges that her trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to adequately investigate the case and recommending that she accept the guilty plea.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced criminal charges against Mellott.  On December 19, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, charging Mellott with violating the antifraud provisions of W.R.A.P. 11(b) and 13(a)(2) and 14(b)(3) and 15(a), and ordering her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Mellott consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions and orders her to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Riddle and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Wayne R. LaFave. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Wyoming Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Wyoming Attorney General's Office in this matter."
