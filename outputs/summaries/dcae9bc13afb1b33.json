  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Wisconsin today announced criminal charges against a Wisconsin-based company that provides contract cleaning services to nursing homes, retirement centers, and rehabilitation facilities.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison, Wis., alleges that, under its standard service agreement with a client location, HSG provides housekeeping, dry cleaning, pressing, and dyeing services to more than 3000 clients.  According to the complaint, the company provided services to its clients in the form of \"laundry services\" that were not taxable under the federal tax laws.  For example, the complaint alleges that HSG provided its clients with an entire laundry department that was responsible for performing the laundry services.  As alleged, however, that the company did not provide such services as \"straight\" or \u201cintertwined\u201d with its clients and therefore did not qualify for a five percent sales tax on the services it provided.  In a parallel action, the Wisconsin Department of Revenue today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against HSG, charging it with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  HSG has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay civil penalties in the amount of $605,459.07, plus interest of $270,084.84, for a total of $1.9 million.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Scott A. Mascianica of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Wisconsin State Corporation Commission in this matter."
