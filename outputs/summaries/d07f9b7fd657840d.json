  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against Kansas Attorney General Ken Paxton in a workers compensation case.  The court found that the Kansas Workers Compensation Act (WPA) violated due process provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Kansas City, Paxton was injured while performing a routine routine maintenance job. The complaint alleges that Paxton suffered a severe spinal cord injury and was unable to perform routine maintenance work.  As alleged in the complaint, the WPA violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Kansas State Board of Pharmacy and Rules 5b-5 and 5c-8 thereunder.  Paxton agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions and orders him to pay $14,804.70 for a 6% impairment rating under the Sixth Edition of the AMA Guides.  In a parallel action, the Kansas Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has filed an emergency action against Paxton, alleging that he violated the anti-fraud provision of the state's law. Paxton consented, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint to the court, to a permanent injunction and a temporary restraining order. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by James R. Ahrens and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Paxton. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kansas Department of Insurance."
