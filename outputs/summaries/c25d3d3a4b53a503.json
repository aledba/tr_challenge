  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against three defendants who were found liable for their roles in an attempted felony murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Myron Lee, a resident of Atlanta, and two brothers, Issac Jenkins and Keshawn Lenear, confronted the victim in the parking lot of a barbershop in Dougherty County, Georgia, and demanded the victim\u2019s wallet and cell phone. According to the complaint, Lee told the victim that he was strapped, that he had hit his leg and said he was \u201cstrapped,\u201d and that his brothers knew what was planned for the victim. The complaint further alleges that the defendants took his cell phone, which was in his pocket, and told him to get out of the car. The SEC alleges that Lee and Jenkins violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17-8-57 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Lee, Jenkins, and Lenear consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering Lee to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering Lenear to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The judgment also prohibits Lee from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the sale or purchase of any security or other security measure. The final judgment also bars Lee from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and bars Lenear from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney or as a public figure. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for Georgia today announced criminal charges against Lee and his two brothers. The case was investigated by the Atlanta Regional Office and the case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans."
