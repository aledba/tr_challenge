  "summary": "On August 30, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia entered a final judgment against a West Virginia man who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in West Virginia, alleges that defendant Jasman Montgomery, along with his co-conspirator, Brandon Flack, entered into a guilty plea to first-degree murder based on information that he had received from his trial counsel. According to the complaint, the defendants planned to steal money from the victim's home and execute a forced entry into the home. The complaint alleges that Petitioner entered into the guilty plea by stating that he did not personally do the killing, had no intent to commit the crime, and had no intention of committing the crime. Instead, the complaint alleges, as alleged, that the defendants made a series of false statements to the court during the course of the trial, including that they did not know that the victim had been shot and that the bullet that killed the victim was not fired from his weapon. The SEC also alleges that defendants who entered guilty pleas by information did not have sufficient information to convince the court that they were entitled to a fair trial. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for West Virginia today announced criminal charges against Petitioner.  In a related matter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained an asset freeze against all defendants in connection with a related criminal case. The agency's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Scott Frost and supervised by Marc Blau of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Frost and Mr. Blau. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter, and the Federal Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to help identify potential red flags of potential criminal activity."
