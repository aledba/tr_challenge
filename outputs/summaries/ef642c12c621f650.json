  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a contempt order against Robert Gregg Sease for contempt of court for doing work that caused water to be diverted from Sheep Creek.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that, between 2003 and 2007, Sease engaged in contemptuous work on the Sease Ranch, including constructing new water structures, placing boulders within the ordinary high-water mark, and dredging material in seven sites along the property. The complaint alleges that Sease failed to comply with the 2013 Order, which required him to pay a $30,000 penalty and to submit plans for the work to the court. Sease also allegedly failed to timely complete his community service and to pay his $100,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Colorado today announced criminal charges against Sease. The SEC also charged Sease with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the Exchange Act and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval. The court's order also prohibits Sease from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order. The order also requires Sease to pay $5,000 each day until certain stream and wetland restoration projects are completed, and the amount of his restitution will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC. In addition, the court will determine whether to impose a civil penalty based on the facts presented in the Complaint. In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted a hearing on the matter. The hearing was conducted in the absence of any evidence to support its findings. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the Denver Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Department of Natural Resources, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Denver Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, the Utah Department of Justice, the Arizona Department of Banking and Securities and the Colorado Office of Insurance Regulation."
