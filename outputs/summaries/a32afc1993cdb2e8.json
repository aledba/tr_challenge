  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against J.F. Microtechnology SDN BHD, Inc., a Kansas City, Missouri-based microcap company, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that JFM's Zigma test contactor is designed to test integrated circuit devices.  According to the complaint, Zigma's design is based on conductive \"contacts\" in a \"housing\" and \"load board,\" and that Zigma uses a \"wide sheet of elastomers\" to create a \"grid of contacts\" between the housing and the housing wall.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as alleged in the JFM complaint, the Zigma contact is designed and manufactured by a highly stiff, precompressed elastomer, and that the \"long-felt\" part of the contact is directly engaged with the housing.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, JFM consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins JFM from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders JFM to pay $636,807 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  JFM also agreed to pay a $1,500 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  On May 17, 2016, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Gottschall of the U. S. District court for New York granted the motion for a temporary restraining order, entered a preliminary injunction against JFM, and issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver.  A hearing on May 24, 2016 was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Feb. 18, 2016).  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Friedman and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Friedman. The case is being supervised by Chedly C.
