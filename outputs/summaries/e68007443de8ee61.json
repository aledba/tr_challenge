  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against Nicholas Honchariw, a California resident who filed a civil injunctive action against the city of Stanislaus for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 66499.37 of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Hensler, California on May 22, 2012, Honchriw proposed to divide a 33.7-acre parcel of land in Knights Ferry, California into eight residential parcels and one undeveloped parcel. The complaint alleges that the city's action prevented development of 40 percent of the land.  The complaint further alleges that Honchrariw filed an inverse condemnation action on the same day the city denied his request for an exception to the federal rent control rule. The SEC's final judgment, which permanently enjoins the city from violating these provisions, ordered Honchraw to pay $77,610 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Honcharariw.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the anti-fraud provision of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2014, the court granted a preliminary injunction against the defendants from further violations of these provisions and ordered the defendants to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and a $20,000 penalty. The settlements are subject to the court's approval. The court's order also prohibits defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any action or proceeding that is related to the enforcement of the securities laws, including the issuance of a cease-and-desist order and the appointment of a receiver for the receiver. The defendants also have agreed to pay civil penalties equal to their respective civil monetary penalties.  Finally, the SEC acknowledges the assistance of the California Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of the Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-1.  Separately, the Department of Justice filed an administrative action in the parallel criminal case. The case is being handled by John R. Rymas and Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by"
