  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Utah today entered final judgments against Deseret Book Company, Inc., a Utah-based entertainment company, and its former CEO, Thomas P. Thompson, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that, prior to hiring Thompson to play the role of Connie Lou during a holiday theatrical production in 2014, the company hired a stage actress, singer, and songwriter to play \"Connie Lou,\" one of the two main characters in the production.  According to the complaint, as part of a multi-factor analysis, the Board determined that, although Thompson was independently established in the entertainment industry, she was not an employee.  In its final judgment, the court held that, based on the Board's findings, Thompson was not entitled to the right of control and direction over the performance of a performance, and therefore was not a \"employee\" under the company's contract.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Deseret and Thompson consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the company to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Deseret also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Salt Lake Regional Office by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Scott A. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Department of Workforce Services and the Utah Office of Inspector General in this matter."
