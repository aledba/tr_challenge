  "summary": "On March 20, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment finding that the Federal Arbitration Association (FAA) had preempted an arbitration provision in a contract for improvement of real property in Florida.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that, in October 2016, a Florida company entered into an arbitration agreement with Affirmed Drywall Corp., a Michigan limited liability company, in violation of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the agreement required arbitration in Florida of a contract that requires a resident contractor, subcontractor, sub-subcontractor, or materialman to arbitrate.  In addition, the complaint alleged that the arbitration provision was void and unenforceable because it was not applicable to any contract under federal law.

For example, the SEC previously issued an order requiring Florida courts to enforce arbitration agreements within the scope of the FAA, and the court previously ordered the defendants to comply with that order by appointing a receiver to determine whether the arbitration agreement is valid and enforceable under the federal and state laws. The court also ordered the companies to pay civil penalties of $10,000 each.  On March 24, 2018, a federal district court in Miami, Florida entered an order finding that a Florida-based arbitration company had violated the federal, state, and local securities laws by failing to adequately disclose that the Florida arbitration agreement was void as well as the Florida state law that requires arbitration agreements to be issued by a court in the state.  This order, which was entered without prejudice to the parties, requires the defendants"
