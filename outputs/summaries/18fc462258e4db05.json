  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Pride Centric Resources, Inc. (\"Pride\"), a food service equipment collective, for violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, Pride, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Pride Marketing and Procurement, Inc., engaged in a fraudulent scheme to acquire IberiaBank, L.L.C. (\"Iberia\").  The complaint alleges that Pride failed to disclose material misstatements in its audited financial statements, including that the Iberian bank's books and records were not audited by Pride, and that it relied on the audited audits to determine whether it had sufficient reserves to meet its obligations under the Exchange Act.  In addition, Pride alleges that it failed to detect or identify any material weaknesses in its internal controls.  The SEC's order against Pride, which entered into a temporary restraining order on June 13, 2016, permanently enjoins Pride from pursuing its own claims against Iberi, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $5,715,061.20.  On June 19, 2017, the court granted the SEC request for an emergency asset freeze and an asset freeze, which is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Pride has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and ordering the payment of civil penalties of $7,000,000.00 and $100,130.81, respectively, in the amount of $1,204,054.79, which would be deemed sufficient to cover Pride's losses in the event of a default.  It also granted the court's request for a temporary injunction against further violations of Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 15a-3, and for the appointment of a receiver.   The court's order also prohibits Pride from acting as an unregistered broker-dealer or representative of a public company, and from participating in any offering of securities in connection with the purchase or sale of a security. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David Curran, Gary Thiakos, Ian McIntyre, and Louis Puissegur, and the litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Curran.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
