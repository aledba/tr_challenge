  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio today announced criminal charges against a Cincinnati-area exotic dancer for her role in a drug-trafficking ring.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cincinnati, Ohio, alleges that on June 25, 2014, the Cincinnati Police Department executed a search warrant to search Holly Galvez's home and bank accounts as part of an ongoing investigation into a drug ring operating in the Northern Kentucky and Greater Cincinnati area. The complaint alleges that Galvez, who was previously charged with possession of drug paraphernalia in violation of the federal securities laws, was the target of the drug ring. Galvez allegedly told the officers that she had used the money to support her lifestyle and to pay for her living expenses.  According to the complaint, Galvez also allegedly told officers that Williams was her boyfriend, he had a key to her residence, and he would visit her one to two times a week to rent cars in her daughter's name.  She also allegedly claimed that Williams had paid her rent, $500 to $1,000 per week, for which she received no money for the rent, and that Williams directed Galvez to empty one of her bank accounts.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $16,638.06 with prejudgment interest of $2,620.71, and a civil penalty of $19,823.06. The court also granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from destroying any evidence, including bank statements, tax returns, or other records.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Department for the Southern District of New York today announced related criminal charges.  On August 2, 2018, the U. S. Attorney for the Central District of Pennsylvania announced criminal proceedings against Galvez.  Among other things, the SEC charged Galvez with a felony for her participation in a scheme that generated more than $1.3 million in illicit proceeds.  Galvez agreed to settle the charges against her by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and ordering her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a $1 million officer and director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval."
