  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against a former principal of a public school who allegedly engaged in a pattern of inappropriate touching of students.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that former principal James Shelburne violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from October 2010 through October 2010, Shelbournee engaged in multiple acts of sexual misconduct, including hugging and hugging students, touching their hands and back, and telling one student that he could not have an erection.  In addition, the complaint alleges that during a visit to the school in October 2010 and September 2011, Shelborne allegedly made a series of inappropriate comments to students, including one about a girl falling forward, and another about a man touching her on the back.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the school district knew or should have known that Shelburnee had engaged in this conduct and that he was liable for any harm caused by it.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint filed in the federal district court in Manhattan, the SEC has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the district from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Separately, the district agreed to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  On October 26, 2010, the court granted the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order, ordered Shelburnes to return to school, and ordered the district to pay $25 million in disgorgment, a $1 million civil penalty and a $10,000 officer-director penalty. The court also granted the district\u2019S motion for an officer and director bar, ordering the district attorney to appoint a receiver to oversee the investigation of the alleged misconduct. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the California Office of Inspector General, and the California Department of Education. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related case, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Shelburn"
