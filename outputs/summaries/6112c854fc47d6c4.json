  "summary": "On July 19, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado entered a final judgment against Wells Fargo & Co. and McCarthy and Holthus, LLP in a civil injunctive action brought by the Colorado Securities and Exchange Commission.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Wells Fargo and McCarthy violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Wells Fargo was not liable because it began servicing the loan before it defaulted, and that it continued to do so after he defaulted. The complaint also alleges that McCarthy failed to adequately allege that the foreclosure proceeding took place seven years after the note was accelerated and is barred by a six-year limitations period for foreclosure proceedings in Colorado.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that Mr. Obduskey failed to disclose to a debt collector that he had waived the FDCPA claim against it by failing to raise it in the opening brief.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval. The court's order also prohibits Wells Fargo from imposing a penny stock bar, and McCarthy from participating in non-judicial foreclosure proceedings.  To settle the matter, the court agreed to the settlement without prejudice to the parties' motion for summary judgment.  On August 2, 2018, the Court granted the parties a temporary restraining order against further violations of the securities laws and ordered Wells Fargo to cease all direct communications with the borrower when the collector knows the borrower is represented by an attorney. The Court also granted the defendants' request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 1692(a)(6)(F).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC also announced related criminal charges.  Among other things, the SEC today announced that it has obtained a court order halting the foreclosure of a home owned by a third party.  A hearing scheduled for August 26, 2018 is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Department of Banking and Securities, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado Secretary of State's Office."
