  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a civil action brought by the Florida Attorney General's Office against him.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that defendant John/Jane Roe violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1987.2 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Roe sought a court-ordered injunction, a temporary restraining order, and an asset freeze to prevent future violations of the federal securities laws.  In its judgment, the court found that Roe was the prevailing party under the anti-SLAPP provision, and that the court had discretion to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to Roe based on the amount of time he spent on the case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Roe consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, and orders him to pay $21,874 in attorney's fees and $7,500 in costs.  Halbig also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $22,500 civil penalty.   The court also ordered Halbig to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $3,650, which is equal to the amount he has already paid in fees and costs to Roe.  On the same day, Halbig filed a civil injunctive action against Roe, which was entered without prejudice by the trial court.  As a result of the court's order, Roe has agreed to settle the civil action by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the appointment of a receiver to determine the appropriate amount of attorney fees to be awarded.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 2433 (2007).  The complaint also alleges that Halbig violated the pre-judgment provision of section 1987, which requires the court to determine whether a defendant qualifies as a \"prevailing party\" by virtue of his or her receipt of a subpoena pursuant to the relevant federal law.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that Roe violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 15a-1, 16a-2, and 16b-3 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act Section 10(b) of Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13a-14 thereunder and Section 16(a)-1 thereunder; that he violated the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (3) of"
