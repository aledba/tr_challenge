  "summary": "On March 21, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico entered a final judgment against David Lawrence Krueger, Jr., a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, ordering him to pay a $1,600 civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that on January 22, 2017, an undercover agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) contacted an undercover FBI agent and told him that he was going to sell six firearms, including sawed-off shotguns and a firearm with an obliterated serial number.  According to the complaint, the confidential informant agreed to the price of the six firearms and agreed to a 120-month sentence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Mexico today announced that it had obtained a court order requiring the FBI to conduct an independent investigation of the alleged conduct of a felon.

On March 26, 2019 a federal district court in New Mexico issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and imposing a $2,500 civil penalty against Mr. Kueger.

The complaint also alleges that the FBI failed to adequately evaluate the effectiveness of its asset freeze and other emergency relief measures, including an asset freeze, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar.  Finally, the complaint alleges that, in a parallel administrative proceeding, the District Court improperly imposed a 2-level reduction in the defendant\u2019s mandatory sentencing range for a total of 120 months, a sentence at the low end of the applicable sentencing range, and an officer and director bar for a period of five years.   The court also found that the defendant violated the mandatory minimum sentencing provision of the federal securities laws, which requires a judge to determine whether a defendant is entitled to a penalty based on his or her past criminal history, and that a jury should determine whether to impose a penalty at a later date based on the evidence presented in the case.  Specifically, the court found that:   "
