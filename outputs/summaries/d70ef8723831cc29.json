  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against defendant Daekwon \"Daekwon\" Cunningham for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that Cunningham violated Section 24-1 of the federal securities laws by failing to show that he was reckless in discharge of a firearm in public housing.  According to the complaint, Cunningham also failed to demonstrate that he had a reasonable basis for believing that a 1000-foot firearm restriction would protect vulnerable residents of public housing from firearm-related crimes.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to the SEC's findings, Cunningham was not a reasonable person to carry a gun in public and, instead, engaged in a pattern of reckless conduct that was consistent with his prior convictions.  As a result of Cunningham's failure to show reasonable basis, the court held that he violated the federal registration provisions of Sections 5(a)(4) and 5(c)(1).  The court also held that Cunningham failed to show sufficient reasonable basis to prove the existence of a \"reasonable reasonable basis\" for his conviction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions and orders him to pay a civil penalty of three years and a $1,000,000 civil penalty, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related firearm, including in the purchase, sale, or purchase of a gun.  On the same day the court granted the court's motion for a temporary restraining order against Cunningham, ordered him to return to the United States and pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, and ordered Cunningham to pay civil penalties of one-and-a-half times his pre-announcement earnings.  Cunningham also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years and ordered to pay an officer and director bar in the amount of $10,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. \u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U."
