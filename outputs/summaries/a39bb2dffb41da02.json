  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a civil action brought by a former employee of JV Industrial Co., Ltd., alleging that he was exposed to a high concentration of H2S gas and other dangerous chemicals while working in a MWV refinery.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, JVI and its insurers, Steadfast Insurance Company (Steadfast) and AIG Specialty Insurance Co. (ASIC), claimed that on or about April 27, 2008, Baltazar Ortiz of DeRidder, Louisiana, who was an additional insured under MWV's agreement, had been exposed to high concentrations of the gas and dangerous chemicals during the course of JVI's work at the refinery. The complaint alleges that MWV violated the antifraud provisions of Section 23(a) of the agreement and, with prejudice, the pre-judgment provision of Section 9 of the Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that the defendants violated Section 9(a)(3) and Rule 9b2-3 thereunder, and that the SEC is entitled to a judgment ordering a permanent injunction against the defendants, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against MWV.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 24, 2013, for which the SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.N. Office of Insurance Regulation (OIC).  The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint against JVI alleges that, in its complaint, the defendants failed to adequately disclose to investors that they were not entitled to indemnity under the terms and conditions of their policies.  JVI also alleges that the insurers violated Section 10(b) of Exchange Act Section 9, and Section 13(b)(5) of Rule 10a-1 thereunder and Section 15(a)-2 thereunder in connection with the issuance of an SEC order requiring the insurers to show cause and effect to settle claims arising out of or resulting in liability.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC Complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Exchange Act Rule"
