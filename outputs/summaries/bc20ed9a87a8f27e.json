  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Montana today announced criminal charges against Mary Ann Reese Sutton for her role in a 2014 drug-related arrest.  The SEC's complaint alleges that on March 18, 2014, Glasgow Police Chief Bruce Barstad and Deputy Sheriff Wayne Shipp conducted a search warrant at Sutton\u2019s home and observed a large grow light suspended from the ceiling, several running box fans, and nine mature marijuana plants.  According to the complaint, Sutton, who was then serving a jail sentence for marijuana possession and production, was in possession of the marijuana when the officers searched her home.  As alleged, the complaint further alleges that the officers had previously been a registered cardholder, but her card had expired and she was not permitted to possess the marijuana.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Sutton, ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Sutton consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  Additionally, the final judgment orders that Sutton pay a $5,000 civil penalty and bars her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any marijuana-related product for a period of five years.  On October 5, 2015, after a sentencing hearing, the District Court granted Sutton's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered her to surrender her passport.  After the court granted the request, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Mitchell, charging him with violating Section 5 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, and requiring him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $1,500 and $100,000, respectively.  Mitchell agreed to settle the SEC action by consenting to a permanent injunction and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  He agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and a three-year conduct-based injunction, with the right to return his or her passport to the court upon his motion for a hearing."
