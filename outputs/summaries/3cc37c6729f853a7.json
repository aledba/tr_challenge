According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Burlington, Vermont, on December 31, 2017, Travis J. Bostwick, a former corrections officer at the Vermont Treatment Program for Sexual Abusers (VTPSA), was charged with violating the probation condition. The complaint alleges that defendant picked a lock to enter his cell instead of waiting to be let in as instructed, and that the lock was not a barred or all-metal door.

The judge granted the Court's order to hold the defendant to a hearing on Jan. 5, 2019, and to appoint a receiver to determine the amount of restitution to be paid to the receiver. The trial court also ordered the receiver to provide a copy of the probation order to each of the receiver's books. The receiver was instructed to check the books and records of any person who had been convicted of a major disciplinary report and to wait for a correctional officer to come and unlock the door. Without providing any evidence, the receiver could not have access to any of the books or records.  Finally, the trial court found that defendant was not on notice of the program rules when he was expelled from the program, and the receiver had no opportunity to respond to a disciplinary action by the probation officer.
