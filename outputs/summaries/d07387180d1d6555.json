According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, Texas, from June 2013 to June 2014, Mother was chronically homeless and was using illegal drugs. The complaint alleges that the Department of Family and Protective Services (DFS) provided her with a service plan that required her to: obtain employment, pay child support, attend therapy, find stable housing, and submit to weekly drug tests.  The complaint further alleges that Mother did not comply with the DFS' recommendation to terminate her parental rights.
