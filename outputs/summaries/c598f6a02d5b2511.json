  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former Marshall Police Department officer who was convicted of evading arrest or detention with a motor vehicle.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on January 13, 2017, Cedric Levone James attempted to pull over a Nissan Altima after it failed to signal a turn at an intersection. According to the complaint, James' friend, Donald Ray Green, was \"down on his luck\" and requested that Green assist him in stealing from several local businesses. The complaint further alleges that Gatson and Clark were the only two witnesses to testify before the trial court that James was a registered sex offender who had failed to register his vehicle with his compliance officer. The SEC alleges that James agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. James also agreed to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged scheme. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against James arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint. The case was investigated by the SEC's Office of Inspector General, which issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit, and is being supervised by Marc Blau of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
