  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of Sacramento and Sacramento Basketball Holdings LLC in an emergency action to halt construction of a downtown arena project.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, California, alleges that the California Department of Public Health and Environmental Quality (CEQA) provided for expedited CEQA review of the downtown arena construction.  According to the complaint, Saltonstall made only passing arguments, unsupported with citation to authority or evidence, that the project presents an \"imminent threat to public health and safety\" or would adversely affect \"unforeseen important\" historical, archaeological, or ecological values.\"  The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office filed a civil injunctive action on June 10, 2014, denying the city's motion for a preliminary injunction.  In its order, the court found that the city violated the federal securities laws by failing to comply with certain of the requirements of Section 21168.6. The court also found that, contrary to the stated intent of the court, the city failed to meet certain of those requirements and failed to file a required showing to justify the injunction against the project. The Court also found the city liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal laws, ordering the city to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and ordering the court to issue an injunction against future violations of the anti-fraud provision of Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Secretary of State's Office and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter."
