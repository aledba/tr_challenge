  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Duquesne University, a Catholic school in the Spiritan tradition, ordering the university to exercise jurisdiction over certain of its religious schools.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that the university violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in 2012.  According to the complaint, the university and its principal, Cardinal Timothy Manning, agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the university from exercising jurisdiction over any school that does not comply with the federal laws, including religious schools and their teachers.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Education and the Department of Education today announced that it has issued an order appointing a new Board of Trustees to determine whether certain of the school\u2019s faculty members are sufficiently religious to perform the job duties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Great Falls and Carroll College agreed to participate in the appointment and evaluation of faculty at their respective religious schools, without violating the federal statutes, and without imposing any pre-judgment or administrative penalties. The college and Carroll also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The university and Manning agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to the appointment of a new board of trustees. The settlement is subject to court approval. The University of Wisconsin-Madison and Carroll have agreed to a settlement that permanently restrains them from violating these provisions. The school and Carroll will pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The colleges and universities will also be subject to a $50,000 penalty. In addition, the college and the university will be required to pay an officer and director of a religious college. The district attorney will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties at a later date. The rest of the litigation will be led by Douglas Laycock and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
