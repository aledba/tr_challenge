  "summary": "On April 11, 2017, the Arizona Court of Appeals entered a final judgment against Richard Allen Reed, Jr., a convicted felon, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13-106 of the Arizona Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  According to the court's order, Reed was denied his right to appeal based on his prior conviction for voyeurism, a Class 5 felony, in January 2015.  The court found that Reed had both a jury trial and a bench trial resulting in the conviction, and that Reed was not convicted by the court.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Arizona today announced criminal charges against Reed.  On July 24, 2014, a federal district court in Arizona granted Reed's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $500,000 restitution order.  Reed's counsel also filed a second appeal, this time against a restitution order entered against him by the Arizona Attorney General's Office.  As alleged in the SEC's complaint, Reed died while this matter was pending, and the court granted Reed\u2019s request for an injunction, granted the victim attorneys\u2019 fees, and granted the defendant a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to repay the amount of his restitution, and imposes a civil penalty of $250,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining Reed from violating the charged provisions of the state securities laws and ordering a preliminary injunction against future violations.  For further information, see Arizona v. Reed, 355 Ariz. 539, 982 P.2d 815 (1999).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Vigliotto and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Phoenix Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Vigo and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the Arizona Department of Justice in this matter."
