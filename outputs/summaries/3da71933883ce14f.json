  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a company that issued a series of professional liability insurance policies to Ryan D. Smith.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Franklin County, Ohio, alleges that Smith violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Smith's company, Synergy Clinic, sought a declaratory judgment that would resolve the litigation arising from Smith's alleged misconduct with a therapy clinic and a licensed lumber company.  Smith allegedly engaged in a pattern of deplorable and illegal behavior towards Jane Doe and over 40 other female patients.  In addition, the complaint alleges that at treatment sessions between May 2017 and June 2017, Smith touched the \"pectoralis muscle of [her] left breast\" in a way that made [she] feel uncomfortable.  He then placed his penis in her hand.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Smith consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  On May 31, 2018, the Court granted a temporary restraining order against Smith and ordered him to return to court on July 31, 2019.  As set forth in the court's order, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction against Smith, a conduct-based injunctive relief, and an officer-and-director bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company, as well as a penny stock bar.  Additionally, the court granted an emergency court order temporarily restraining Smith from participating in any action that may arise in the future, including the issuance of a civil injunction, ordering him to surrender his passport, and requiring him to provide a copy of his medical history to the court upon motion by the SEC.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Smith arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
