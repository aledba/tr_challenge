  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a California-based insurance company that improperly obtained workers' compensation insurance for its own employees.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on December 7, 2018, Jessie Lord and its owner, StaffChex, LLC, obtained workers\u2019 compensation insurance in 2008 under contracts with a special employer under which the special employer was required to obtain workers- compensation insurance. The complaint alleges that, in 2011, the Special Employer and Jessie Lord entered into an agreement that excluded certain employees from coverage for special employees. In 2011, a federal court found that the Special employer had a valid and reasonable obligation to procure workers-compensation insurance for certain employees when the general employer was insolvent. In 2012, the SEC issued an order requiring the Special Employee to sign an endorsement in writing that did not relieve CIGA of liability for Mastache\u2019s injury. In 2013, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Jessie Lord from violating the federal securities laws and ordered her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Philadelphia Regional Office and the case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Office of Insurance Regulation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance.  For further information, see Press Release No. 5275, July 2, 2015.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Mastache. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Insurance Enforcement's Asset Management Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has obtained an order appointing an independent receiver to oversee the issuance and operation of workers-coverage insurance in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. \u00a0 The SEC is continuing its investigation into Mastache's injury.   The litigation is being led by John R. Rymas and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans."
