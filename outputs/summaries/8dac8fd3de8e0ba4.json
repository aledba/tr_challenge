  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of possession of child pornography in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that, on November 14, 2008, the Connecticut State Police Computer Crimes and Electronic Evidence Laboratory obtained a search warrant for a home in Wallingford, Connecticut. According to the complaint, the search warrant was issued on the basis of information obtained from a Wyoming special agent who had access to child pornography. The complaint further alleges that the defendant accessed the images through a peer-to-peer network and did not simply browse the images. Rather, the complaint alleges, the defendant had file sharing software installed on his or her computer and was using that software to share multiple files of suspected child pornography by way of a peer to peer network on more than one occasion. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Connecticut today announced criminal charges against the defendant. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Hanisko, charging him with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder, and with aiding and abetting the defendant's violations of Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Section 10-b) and Rule 15b2-3 thereunder of the Exchange Act and Rules 15a-20, 13a-1, and 12b-13 thereunder and the related reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a). The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Attorney General's Office in this matter."
