  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against Michael & Son Services, Inc. (\"M&S\"), a Virginia-based home improvement contractor, for improper venue.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that, in October 2016, M&S hired Mr. Aguilar as a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning technician to perform services and repairs in the District of Columbia.  According to the complaint, while he was employed at M & S, he never performed any work for M& S outside of the district of Columbia, and his supervisors and records were all located in the Norfolk, Virginia office.  In addition, the complaint alleges that he frequently worked more than forty hours per week and that, per company policy, he did not leave the district to perform this work.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, that this conduct arose from events that occurred in Virginia.  M&&S's complaint also alleges that it never left the district for his work with M &S, and that all of his tasks were assigned by supervisors from the Norfolk office and the company did not compensate him for this overtime work.\u00c2\u00a0 The complaint further alleges that the Norfolk Division has an interest in deciding the case since the complaint arose within that division.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint\u00c2\u00a0the court has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins M&s from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the company to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Aug. 31, 2013).  The Complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order, an injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and an officer and director bar.  Finally, the SEC seeks an order appointing a receiver to facilitate the transfer of the case.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge William G. Donnelly of the United States District Court in Alexandria entered a judgment ordering the receiver to comply with the court's order.  Donnelly also issued an order suspending the receiver from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney, ordering him to provide a copy of the complaint to be filed with the SEC as part of a case-by-case review.  A hearing is scheduled for June 5, 2018. "
