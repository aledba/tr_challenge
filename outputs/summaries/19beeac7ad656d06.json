  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a New York City man accused of illegally entering the United States without being present in the country of his birth.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Mauricio Barros Anguisaca, 46, of Ecuador, was arrested without authorization on August 16, 1993 and subsequently reentered the country without being deported.  The complaint alleges that Barros, who was previously barred from entering the country as a U.K.-based citizen, filed a second amended petition on January 18, 2019, seeking a temporary restraining order preventing Barros from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Barros' amended petition also alleges that, in violation of Section 1252 of the Exchange Act, Barros violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 13b2-3 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Department of Justice today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting Barros's unauthorized entry to the country and ordering him to comply with the order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the Department of Homeland Security has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Barros of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10b of Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20, and orders Barros to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer and director bar.  On February 13, 2017, Judge Katherine Polk Failla issued an order temporarily suspending Barros\u2019 removal proceedings from the New York area.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's New York Regional Office, and is being supervised by Marc Blau of the Philadelphia Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New Jersey Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (OIEA) in this matter."
