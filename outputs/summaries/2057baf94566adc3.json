  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment in favor of a Kansas City, Missouri-based company and its former CEO, Gary Tauvar, on claims of negligence and negligence per se.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson County, Missouri, alleges that, from 2008 through 2012, Tauvar and his company, Union Pacific Railroad, engaged in a series of false and misleading statements in affidavits submitted to the court in support of the company's motion for summary judgment.  In one instance, the complaint alleges that Tauvar was attacked in a public alleyway and was confronted by an unknown individual who had recently been seen by neighbors parking on the railroad tracks and going into the alleyway while they were awaiting the results of the municipal election.  According to the complaint, after Tauvar confronted the individual, he allegedly told him that he would \"keep[\u2009] an eye out\u201d for an identified male who used to help Tauvar in the area, and he would \u201ckeep[&###&#@]an eye out\" for any person who might be driving by the time he entered the building.    The complaint also alleges that Union Pacific agreed to provide security patrols near Tauvar's property because it was foreseeable that a third person could cause harm to K.L.S., which was not on the property owned by Union Pacific.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri Department of Commerce, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
