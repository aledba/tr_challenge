  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Ohio today announced criminal charges against Davian Warren.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, alleges that, on April 4, 2017, Warren was indicted for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of the federal securities laws. Warren was sentenced to a prison term ranging from 51 to 63 months.  According to the complaint, while incarcerated and awaiting sentencing, Warren and his brother had an altercation that left Warren badly injured and Warren's brother badly injured. The complaint further alleges that Warren used his own criminal history to commit the felony, and that, based on his prior criminal history, he was entitled to the maximum possible upward variance under the federal sentencing guidelines.  Warren was also charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Warren has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 3553, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the statutory maximum of 120 months. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N.
