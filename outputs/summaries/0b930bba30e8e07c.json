  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former judge in a civil injunctive action brought by a former law clerk for the Fourth Judicial District Court of New Orleans.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans on July 22, 2015, Stanley R. Palowsky III, a law clerk to the judges of the court, filed a First Supplemental, Amended, and Restated Petition for Damages alleging that Allyson Campbell violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC alleges that Ms. Campbell aided and abetted the defendants' violations of the anti-fraud provisions, including by destroying documents in the court's possession and by improperly handling them. In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants violated the pre-judgment provision of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, by destroying or withholding documents from the judge or jury without the judge's knowledge, and by conspiring to conceal her actions.  The SEC further alleges that, in a parallel action, the court granted the defendants the right to strike, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to hold a hearing on the merits of the matter and to order the judge to consent to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of these provisions. The court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 each.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted an investigation that was conducted by the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, with the assistance of trial counsel. The litigation will be led by Messrs. Spitzer, Stump, and Amman. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov\u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.
