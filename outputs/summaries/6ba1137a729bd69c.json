  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a class action action brought by Gabriel Montoya, a California resident, alleging that his 2003 Ford Excursion was defective in numerous ways including the turbocharging system. But on November 6, 2006, the federal district court denied class certification for the Excursion. The court held that the statute of limitations for violations of the implied warranty of merchantability was four years, and that the amount of money owed to the class would be determined by the court at a later date. In its judgment, the court found that American Pipe tolling, sometimes called \"stacking,\" is not allowed during class actions. In fact, according to the court's order, it is mandatory for a defendant tolling during the period of a second class action to be timely. The Court also ruled that a third class action could be brought by putative class members. In a parallel action, filed in federal court in Utah on May 20, 2013, Montoya was able to obtain a judgment against Ford of almost $59,000, which was roughly an $8,000 return over what he had originally paid for the vehicle 10 years earlier. The judgment also allowed Montoya to opt out of the class action in the face of an impending settlement that would have given him only a fraction of the money he would ultimately be awarded by suing individually.  The court also granted Montoya a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay $58,880.37 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $12,822.03. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate case, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Montoya.
