  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against Hightop Brown, LLC, a Pennsylvania-based real estate development company, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia on April 23, 2016, the court found that, in violation of Section 14-303(8)(e)(2) of the Philadelphia Zoning Code, HIGHTOP Brown failed to show that it had the requisite standing to apply for a use variance.  The court also found that Hightopp Brown had no standing to challenge the application, and that the ZBA had no jurisdiction over the matter.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hightoop Brown consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 24, 2017, the Honorable Paul G. Mascianica of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) entered final judgments against the defendants, finding that the defendants had violated the anti-fraud provision of Sections 14-3(a) and 14-30(b)(5) and (c) thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion of the court.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Licensing and Inspections, the Federal Office of Inspector General, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC has also issued an Investor Alert about potential conflicts of interest arising from the issuance of a Zoning Board of Advisors (ZBA) order requiring that investors consider the viability of any ZBA application before it is issued.  Investor Alerts:  Investors should be wary of investing in real estate without being sure of the safety and well-being of the people selling the real estate."
