  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Backcountry Against the Dump, Inc., a California-based attorney firm, alleging that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, California, alleges that the court improperly imposed a fee award on a defendant based on his or her successful filing of an anti-SLAPP motion.  According to the complaint, the court found that, when tabulating the fee award, BAD sought a flat hourly rate of $275 for all of its counsel because that rate disregarded the different levels of experience for each of BAD's counsel and disregarded BAD's evidence of the prevailing market rate for similar work performed by similarly qualified attorneys.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their fees and costs.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendant, and ordering the asset freeze and other emergency relief ordered by the court. The court also issued an order suspending the issuance of a cease-and-desist order and imposing a $30,752.86 civil penalty.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2019, is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.
