  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a California State University professor who filed a civil injunctive action against the university for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that Sungho Park, a tenure-track assistant professor at California State, was unlawfully denied tenure because he was of Korean national origin and qualified for tenure. The complaint alleges that Park pursued an internal grievance, which resulted in the university denying him tenure. According to the complaint, the university ultimately terminated Park, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The SEC alleges that, based on the university\u2019s decision not to grant Park tenure, Park was liable for a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that the university would pay.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Department of Justice today announced criminal charges against Park arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC filed a settled civil action against Park, charging him with violations of Section 425 of the federal securities laws. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Park. The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the San Diego Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter."
