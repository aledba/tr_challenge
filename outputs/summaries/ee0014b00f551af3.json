  "summary": "On June 27, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a final judgment against Bryant Neal \"Doe\" Hughes, a New York City resident who was convicted of aiding and abetting the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, from 2014 to 2016, Doe, a self-described \"moderate Muslim,\" entered the United States to join ISIS.  The complaint alleges that, while in ISIS training camps, Doe was confronted by a group of ISIS members who told him that he was going to be a \"quisling,\u201d a loyal soldier of the enemy, and that he would be a \u201cman of the people.\u201d  As alleged in the complaint, Doe agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years.  In a parallel action, the Department of Justice today announced that it has obtained a court order freezing the assets of the defendants and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and impose a $75,000 civil penalty against each of them.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David J. Trimbach and Nicole Reiz of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the New York State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
