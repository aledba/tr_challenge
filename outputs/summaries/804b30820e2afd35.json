  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Michael Gehrke, who was convicted of second-degree felony murder for the death of Christopher Pineyro.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, on May 9, 2018, Gehrek was charged with second- and third-degree felonies based on second-and-a-half felony murder. The complaint alleges that the defendants were confronted by a man wielding a pocketknife who demanded that the State rest its case after it had concluded its case in chief. The SEC alleges that, in reality, the defendants had no choice but to rest their case after moving to amend the charges. In addition, as alleged in the complaint, the defendant had no opportunity to cross-examine any witnesses called by the State with the objective of raising a reasonable doubt as to whether the State had rested its case. In fact, as the complaint alleges, the State did not even consider adding a second degree felony murder charge to the list of charges it had previously charged. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Gehrkes.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants.  On May 10, 2019, the court entered a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (Advisers), Rule 206(3) and (4) thereunder. The court granted the court's order to freeze the assets, freeze the defendants' assets, and order the destruction of any evidence that may have been obtained from the alleged misconduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the Defendants agreed to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordered the Defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000. The defendants also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000 each. The settlements are subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David A. Kasper and Eric R. Werner of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Werner and Ms. Braunstein."
