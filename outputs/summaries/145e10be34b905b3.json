  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in a rent stabilization case against a New York City apartment building.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan on April 16, 2012, Piers Playfair and his wife, Uta Hagen Berghof, were the first tenants of apartment 3C at 27 Washington Square North in Manhattan.  The complaint alleges that the apartment was not subject to rent stabilization because in 2010, when the apartment became vacant, the owner removed the J\u201351 tax exemption benefits from the building and replaced them with rent-stabilized rent.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the J-51 benefits had expired several months earlier, and the apartment had become vacant at a time when the rent control benefits had already expired.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Playfair.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint or petition, Playfair consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $2,322.72, prejudgment interest of $1,548.48, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On May 9, 2013, the court granted the complaint's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Playfair to comply with the court's order.  At the same time, on October 27, 2015, the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) issued an order suspending the registration of the apartment and ordering it to be deregulated, with the right to reapply after four years. The court also granted the apartment's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered the apartment to be re-registered, and ordered the building to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for October 26, 2015.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-19, Litigation Bulletin No. 13-cv, Liturgical Release No-19-20, Litigated Release No.-13-20.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Werner.
