  "summary": "On March 21, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of Louise J. Pranno Donkle, who died on September 16, 2012.  The court found that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $50,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on March 22, 2016, the defendants violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act by failing to adequately represent plaintiff in her capacity as successor trustee of the Louise J.'s estate.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains, and impose civil penalties of up to $100,000, and order the return of the defendants' property to be determined by the court at a later date.  On March 24, 2018, the court entered a judgment against defendants, permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 5, and ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $150,000 and a $75,000 civil penalty, and appointing an attorney to represent them in the litigation.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Insurance, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Department of Health and Human Services today announced that it had issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of insider trading in the securities of certain microcap issuers."
