The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that, on June 20, 2012, Davion Griffin, a member of the street gang the Forum Park Crips, was shot and killed in the parking lot of a southwest Houston nightclub.  According to the complaint, Griffin was present at the nightclub when the shooting occurred, but did not participate in the planning or execution of the murders.

McCluskey agreed to settle the SEC case by consenting to a permanent injunction against further violations of Section 15(a)(1) and 16(b)(2) of The Securities Act and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from associating with anyone with a criminal history.
