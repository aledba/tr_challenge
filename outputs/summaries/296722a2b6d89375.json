  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment in favor of a citizen's request for the names and addresses of successful bidders at a public auction of government property.  The court also issued an order requiring the disclosure of the names, addresses, and social security numbers of people who bought the property. The court previously granted the court's request to unseal the records.  On May 3, 2014, an auction was held at the Bergen County Law and Public Safety Institute to sell sports memorabilia seized by the Prosecutor's Office. According to the Court's order, the defendants knew that they were participating in a private auction and that the auction would be cloaked in privacy. The Court found that the defendants had a reasonable expectation that public access to the records would invade a person's reasonable expectation of privacy. In addition, the court found that disclosure would create a security risk for the buyers.  In a parallel action, on December 9, 2015, the Honorable Bonnie Mizdol of the New Jersey Court of Appeals issued a written opinion that directed the court to order the release of the records, without including the names or addresses, of the successful applicants. The order also ordered the court not to impose any civil injunctive relief, including an order to freeze the defendants' assets and to bar them from participating in any future public auction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. In a separate administrative proceeding, the Court issued a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.N. Secret Service, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Department of Justice in this matter."
