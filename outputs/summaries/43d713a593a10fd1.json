  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against a Lawrence, Kansas-based paraprofessional educator for her role in the school district's sexual exploitation of a child program.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that Teri Lynn Johnson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Johnson, while employed as a paraeducator at the Lawrence Public School system, engaged in sexual activity with a student under the age of 18 who was engaged in a course of conduct similar to the one alleged in the complaint.  Johnson allegedly engaged in this conduct through the use of social media, including on Facebook and Snapchat, and by sending the student nude photographs of her breasts and vagina and a video of herself masturbating.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Johnson.  As alleged, Johnson was not in a position of authority when she engaged in the conduct, and the court found her guilty on all of the charges.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Johnson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $250,000.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordered Johnson to return to the district court for a hearing scheduled for June 5, 2019.
