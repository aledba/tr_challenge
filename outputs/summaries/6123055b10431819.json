  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a medical malpractice action.  The court entered the final judgment on the merits of the case against the defendants.  According to the court's order, filed on January 29, 2016, Judge Lager granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment in a civil action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Connecticut.  In its order, the court found that, while he was a patient of Barnes, the defendants deviated from the applicable professional standard of care by failing to disclose that Barnes had suffered a serious impairment in the blood flow to his feet and by failing, as a result of, failing to refer Barnes to a vascular specialist, resulting, inter alia, in the partial amputations of Barnes' feet.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Barnes consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.

Finally, on July 18, 2016 Judge Lagers issued a scheduling order requiring Barnes to provide expert testimony on the basis of his knowledge of the prevailing professional standard for treating patients, which he had previously concluded was reasonable and appropriate.  As set forth in the order, Barnes failed to provide any evidence to support his claim that he had a reasonable basis for representing that he suffered a severe impairment in his own feet and that he should be barred from appearing as an expert in any litigation proceeding based on his or her knowledge of or experience with the subject matter of a case.  She also failed to mention that, in seeking to preclude Barnes from disclosing additional experts, she failed to disclose to her treating kidney doctor and vascular surgeon that she did not perform the types of amputations that [Barnes'] vascular surgeon performed on him.   The order also requires that Barnes provide evidence to show the cause of the injury or disease, including that the defendant had a medical condition that was not caused by the injury, and that the trial judge had full and complete authority to determine"
