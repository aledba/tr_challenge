  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that, in August 2012, defendant was convicted and sentenced for five felony counts of unlawful use of a firearm. The SEC alleges that the court improperly imposed a 10-year gun minimum sentence on defendant based on the fact that he had previously been sentenced under the federal gun minimum statute. The complaint further alleges that defendant was not eligible for earned time on his sentence for that conviction because he had not previously been convicted of a felony under that statute. According to the complaint, the court ultimately imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years on defendant's 1995 U.W. conviction. The court also ordered that defendant be sentenced to three years' probation, rather than five years\u2019 imprisonment under ORS 161.610(4)(a). The complaint also alleges that defendants were not required to prove, as an additional element of the crime, that their 1995 conviction was not a prior conviction and sentence under the gun minimum. Rather, defendants were required to show that the defendant had been previously punished pursuant to that statute for purposes of imposing a second gun minimum penalty under the same statute. In addition, the complaint alleges that in his second assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred in finding that defendant did unlawfully attempt to use, carry with intent to use and threaten to use unlawfully against [the victim], a firearm, to wit: a.45 caliber pistol, a deadly weapon, and a three-year probationary term. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against defendant for the same conduct and criminal episode. The case was investigated by the Office of Inspector General and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Lara S. Mehraban."
