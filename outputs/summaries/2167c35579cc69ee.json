  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted child pornography violator who was sentenced to 108 months imprisonment and ordered to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that James J. Holland violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Holland agreed to a two-level enhancement for the use of a computer in carrying out a child pornography offense, and to a five-level reduction in his sentence.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, that Holland did not object to the number of images and videos that were included in his collection.  In fact, as the complaint alleges, Holland was responsible for 1,927 images and 16 videos, the equivalent of 1,200 unique images, twice the amount that would warrant application of the mandatory sentencing range.  Holland also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 5 of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $2,500 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of time he will be sentenced to.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Holland has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering him to comply with the court order, and imposing a $500 civil penalty, and requiring him to provide a copy of the SEC Complaint to be sent to the court for review.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see United States v. Denson, 728 F.3d 603, 615 (6th Cir. 2013).  The complaint also alleges that Holland failed to adequately disclose to any employer or potential employer that he possessed 3,127 images of child abuse material, which would qualify him to be eligible for a lifetime term of supervised release, and that he failed to provide evidence to support his motion for a second-level, lower-of-the-Guidelines-range reduction.  To learn more about child pornography, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (2014).  In a related matter, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Holland on March 2, 2015, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an up-to-life sentence."
