  "summary": "On March 8, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the District of Illinois entered a default judgment against defendants Kizzang LLC and Robert Alexander for trademark infringement and unfair competition.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Las Vegas, Nevada, alleges that defendants used the marks FINAL 3 and APRIL MADNESS in connection with their Final Four-based contests.  According to the complaint, the marks were famous for a long period of time, that their marks connect the NCAA's marks to Defendants' marks, and that Defendants' use of the marks was likely to tarnish the goodwill associated with those marks.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the marks are \"likely to cause confusion or to deceive\" among consumers, raising the possibility that the mark will lose its ability to serve as a unique identifier of the company's product.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the registration provisions of the federal trademark laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  Additionally, the final judgment orders defendants to pay a civil penalty of three times the amount they have already paid to settle the case.  On March 9, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in the Southern District of New York, alleging that defendants violated the registration provision of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the charged provisions.  To learn more about trademark dilution, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1114 (Nov. 7, 2017).  In a related matter, the Court issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue an injunction against the defendants based on their alleged receipt of millions of dollars in illegal proceeds from sales of unregistered securities in violation of the anti-dumping, anti-fraud, and penny stock laws, as well as an order requiring defendants to provide a copy of the complaint to the SEC as part of an investigation.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order against defendants, barring them from using the marks, ordering them to provide an accounting of the revenue generated by the sales of their products, and requiring them to comply with the court's order appointing the receiver.  Finally, the court granted the SEC an emergency court order to halt the defendants' registration and issuance of an injunction, which is subject to court approval."
