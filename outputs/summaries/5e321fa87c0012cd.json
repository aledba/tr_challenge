  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of first-degree murder for his role in the death of his four-year-old stepson.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, Malachi Golden was the son of a North Carolina state senator who died from malnutrition and dehydration.  The complaint alleges that Malachi suffered severe dehydration and malnutrition, and that his mother, Tiffany Cheeks, and two half-sisters were the primary caregivers for Malachi.  Malachi allegedly suffered from acute diaper rash, severe dehydration, and severe malnutrition.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendant had a severe history of severe malnutrition, had a history of heart attacks, and had suffered severe head injuries.  In a parallel criminal case, the U. S. Attorney's Office for North Carolina announced criminal charges against Malachi, charging him with one count of first degree murder and two counts of second degree murder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.    The SEC also issued an order suspending Malachi from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of the proceeds of the sale of a penny stock, and ordering Malachi to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his life savings. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Brienza and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Charlotte Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the FBI's Charlotte Field Office, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
