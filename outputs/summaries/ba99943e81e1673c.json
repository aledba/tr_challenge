  "summary": "On May 12, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against M.M., a career service employee at a State Hospital, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, alleges that, in 2012, a supervisor subjected her to sexual harassment, discrimination, and a hostile work environment in violation of the state's anti-discrimination policy. The complaint further alleges that the hospital imposed a five-day suspension and disciplinary action against her for her violations of the policy. In a parallel action, the Department of Health and Human Services (DOH) announced that it would not consider the hospital's findings and discipline as required by the federal law. The hospital also issued a disciplinary order suspending M. for her participation in an EEO investigation, which was conducted by a co-worker who reported M.'s use of the term \"bitch\" in a voicemail message concerning work-related matters. The SEC alleges that M. was not subject to disciplinary action for her violation, and that she had the right to choose the forum in which she could appeal from the hospital. The court's order, which is subject to court approval, prohibits M. from appealing directly to the Commission from violating the federal anti-fraud laws. The Commission's order also requires that the parties provide information about whether they have reasonable grounds to believe that a disciplinary action has been recommended in the case of a violation. In addition, the SEC's order requires the parties to provide reasonable grounds for believing that there is reasonable cause for an appeal.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the Commission issued a final decision on March 21, 2019, that it had found M. guilty of violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, 13b2-2, and 13b-11 thereunder, and requires the employer to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty equal to the amount of any civil penalty imposed.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, M. has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) the securities laws, and orders her to pay a penalty of five years and a $75,000 civil penalty. M. also has agreed to the appointment of a receiver to facilitate her appeal. The settlement is subject"
