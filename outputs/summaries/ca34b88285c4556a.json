  "summary": "On April 3, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a temporary restraining order and ordered the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest in a civil action brought by two Lincolnwood residents.  The SEC's complaint, filed on May 16, 2018, alleges that the Village of Lincolnwood and two residents purchased a 16-foot wide strip of land in trust for public use as an alleyway in 2008.  According to the complaint, the property was statutorily dedicated to the Village, but the limitations period in section 13-101 did not begin to run until 2008, when the Village vacated its interest in the property.  In addition, the complaint alleges that when they purchased the property, a chain link fence divided the parties' backyard properties lines and the 16- foot strip was on their side of the alleyway.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, which is equal to the amount of their civil monetary penalties, and bars them from serving as officers or directors of any municipal entity for the period of 20 years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, the trial court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered them to comply with the court's order. The court also ordered the defendants to provide a copy of a letter signed by the village's president and board of trustees on January 18, 2008, which contained a recommendation that the village should take action to vacate the alleyways.   The court's ruling also prohibits the defendants from destroying any evidence that may be relevant to the determination of the merits of the case. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
