  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Nassau County, N.Y.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that, in 2010, the County of Nassau, New York, elected to adopt a local tax law, Local Law 18, that significantly expands the scope and scope of its power to pass local laws that supersede special state tax laws.  According to the complaint, the county had no prerogative to pass any local tax laws, and its local law was inconsistent with state law.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the County's local law did not permit the County to issue real property tax refunds to its individual taxing districts, and that, as a result of this, it could not pass local taxes that were inconsistent with general state laws, such as the County Guaranty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Nassau and the County consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin the County from violating the federal, state, and local laws, including the Municipal Home Rule Law, and require that the county pay all real property taxes owed by the taxing districts within the county.  Additionally, the court entered a judgment against the County, ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and ordering the county to pay an $80,000 civil penalty against the county, as well as an officer-and-director bar for the County and a penny stock bar against the Co-Chairman of the Board of Assessors.  On January 24, 2019, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the New York District Court issued a temporary restraining order, ordering Nassau to comply with the court's order, and appointing a receiver to determine the jurisdiction of the County. The court also issued an order suspending the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order.  A hearing is scheduled for February 26, 2019. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
