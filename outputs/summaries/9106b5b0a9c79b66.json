  "summary": "On September 22, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia entered final consent judgments against a Georgia-based company and its former CEO in an unfair labor practice case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that, on August 20, 2015, the company and former CEO of Virginia Park, LLC, Andrew Johnson, engaged in misconduct during an election campaign that destroyed the conditions required for a free and fair election.  According to the complaint, Johnson and Merriweather were among those who confronted the company's former CEO and Regional Director about the alleged blocking and threats.  Johnson allegedly told the company that, in the weeks leading up to the election, pro-Union demonstrators approached their cars as they were entering and exiting the Facility's parking lot and confronted them as they exited the facility.  In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained a final judgment against PruittHealth, finding that the company violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering PruittHealth to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, PruittHealth consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins the company from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders the company to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On September 24, 2016 the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Atlanta charging PruittHealth with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (5) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  A hearing officer has agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Scott A. Thompson of the Atlanta Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Georgia Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
