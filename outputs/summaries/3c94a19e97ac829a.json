  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against Kevin Q. Mathis of Winnsboro, Louisiana, for the aggravated kidnapping and attempted first degree murder of Kelli Longoria.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, Mathis was arrested on July 16, 2016, and charged with aggravated kidnapping.  The SEC alleges that Mathis, who lives in Franklin Parish, New Orleans, was the only person to be convicted of the two charges.  Mathis allegedly told the victim that he had a gun and asked her to \"get money off\" of a blue debit card that he stated his uncle had given to him.  He allegedly demanded that she give him the money off of the card.  As alleged in the complaint, the victim complied with Mathis's demands, but Mathis followed her and took her to his mother's house, where he shot her in the head.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Mathis.  On August 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Mathis from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Mathis to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.   The court also granted the SEC &rsqua;s request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and a temporary conduct-related bar. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott Brown, Kelly L. Gibson, John Rymas, and Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Mr. Brown and Ms. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Louisiana State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
