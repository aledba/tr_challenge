  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against Highland Park, Michigan, and its former chief of police, Theodore Cadwell, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, on May 14, 2013, the trial court entered a judgment awarding $760,680 and $47,695, respectively, to Cadwell and Quaker, who were formerly employed by Highland Park as its chief of officers.  The SEC alleges that the court improperly awarded the defendants attorney fees based on the amount of attorney fees they requested.  In its judgment, the court found that $200 per hour was reasonable and appropriate for the time spent trying to recover on the judgment since March 2016.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains or halts their fees, and permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, and orders them to pay $59,660 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a civil penalty equal to the amounts of their attorney fees.

Additionally, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations, an order requiring Highland Park to comply with a court order requiring it to provide an accounting of its assets, and an officer-and-director bar against Cadwell.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 15.364 (March 22, 2013).  The complaint also seeks a temporary injunction, an officer and director bar, an attorney general bar, and civil money penalties.  Finally, the complaint seeks an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to award postjudgment attorneys fees in connection with a judgment following the adjudication of a WPA claim.  On May 20, 2017, a federal district court in Detroit issued an order suspending the issuance, purchase, offer, and sale of securities of Home IV Care, Inc., a company that had been sued by the company in 2008, and ordering it to pay a $50,000 civil penalty.
