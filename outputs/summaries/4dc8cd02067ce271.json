  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against former Vallejo City Manager Joseph Tanner, finding that he was not entitled to have his retirement benefit calculated based on the salary of a city manager or city attorney.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Tanner, a former city manager, entered into a written agreement with CalPERS in which he was to serve as city manager for three years, from January 8, 2007 through January 7, 2010.  The agreement provided that the city would pay Tanner a base salary of $305,844, which was to be determined by a publicly available pay schedule.  However, according to the complaint, the city manager and city attorney positions were not on pay schedules.  Instead, as the complaint alleges, Tanner was paid based on a salary that was not available to the public.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that, in entering into the agreement, Tanner received a salary of \"305,\" which was not included in the pay schedule for his position.  As a result of this, Tanner's retirement benefit was significantly reduced from his original base salary, and the city was unable to determine the amount of his compensation based on that salary.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Tanner consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay an officer and director bar.  On May 8, 2010, the court granted Tanner's request for a writ of mandamus and ordered him to comply with the court's order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and Carol A. Basinger of the Los Angeles Regional Office, with assistance from Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the California Secretary of State's Office, the Department of Health and Human Services, the State Corporation Commission and the California Office of Inspector General."
