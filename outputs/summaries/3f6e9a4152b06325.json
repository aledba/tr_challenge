  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against Georgia-Pacific Consumer Operations, LLC, a Louisiana-based company that manufactures and sells bleaching chemicals.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, alleges that the City/Parish violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the city/parish sought summary judgment on its refund claims based on the fact that GP's purchase of a bleaching chemical in the mid-1990s was not subject to the federal sales and use tax, and that GP was not entitled to a refund as a matter of law.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that GP failed to present any evidence to support its claim that the bleaching process was not within the scope of the 1984 Agreement.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against GP.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, GP consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders it to disgorge its ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposes a $2,629.00 civil penalty against the City of Baton Rouge and a $500,000 civil penalty for GP's violations of Section 13(b)(2) of The Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and orders the company to pay disgorgement of $1.576 million, plus interest of $504,516.41 through April 30, 2017, with a penalty of $750,000.  Additionally, the company has agreed to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $1 million, respectively, for violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(c) and 13(d) and 12d-13 thereunder and to be permanently enjoined from violating Exchange Act Rule 13b-14.  GP has also agreed to a $1 billion civil penalty and to pay an $8,500 civil penalty.  Finally, the SEC"
