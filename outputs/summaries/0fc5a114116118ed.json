  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against Adam Ryan Lagred, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for first-degree aggravated robbery.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnesota, alleges that Lagred violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Lagred.  According to the complaint, in 2013, Lagred was convicted of first- and second-degree felony aggravated robbery and sentenced to 12 months in prison.  Lagred pleaded guilty in a parallel criminal case to one of those charges, and the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  On May 15, 2017, a Renville County, Minnesota jury found Lagred guilty of second- and third-degree criminal sexual conduct.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the jury deliberated for a total of 24 hours before finding Lagred liable for the additional 12-month prison sentence.  To determine whether Lagred should be sentenced, the court required the jury to unanimously agree on the appropriate means of committing a first- degree aggravated robbery, and that the jury should unanimously agree upon the appropriate method of sentencing.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 522 (January 16, 2016).  The U. S. Attorney\u2019S Office for Minnesota today filed criminal charges in the case.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Schad and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans and Kurt L. Gottschall of the SEC Division of Criminal Justice. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Minnesota Department of Justice in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages the public to check the backgrounds of people who commit a crime by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0to identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0Investigations can be conducted using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov\u00c2\u00a0To identify people who are at risk of being victimized by a criminal act,\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an\u00c2\u00a0adviser to\u00c2\u00a0find information about a person who has committed a serious felony or a serious criminal offense."
