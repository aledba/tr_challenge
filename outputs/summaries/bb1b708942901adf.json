  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was previously convicted of second-degree murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Tempe, Arizona, charges Katlyn Gage Marin with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged misconduct.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that, in November 2014, the defendant called 911 and reported that she was in custody for the purpose of obtaining a warrant to conduct an emergency medical treatment.  According to the complaint, Brielle had experienced two seizure-like episodes, one that morning, and one the prior evening, and that she had urinated on her mother and sister.  As alleged, the defendants were being questioned in the family waiting room at the time, and the officers questioned the defendant in the home.  Bielle was not in custody when she made the statements, and she did not consent to the officers' questioning.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the officers restrained her freedom of movement and pressured her to go to the police station when she was being questioned by the officers.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and impose a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order, ordered the defendant to return to her home, and ordered the officers to conduct a search of the defendant's home and any evidence that may be relevant to a finding of custody. The court also issued an order requiring the defendants to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court that enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws and orders them to comply with the court's orders.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the United States District Court in the District of Massachusetts entered final judgments against the defendants, finding that the defendants violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act, ordering them to disgorge their gains, and ordering the officer and director bar against each of them, ordering him to pay a penalty in the amount of $150,000, and imposing a $75,000 bar against the defendant.  Finally, the Court granted the defendant"
