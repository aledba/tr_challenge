  "summary": "On May 11, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey entered final consent judgments against two state agencies to finance a comprehensive renovation of the State House Complex.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, John S. Wisniewski, then a state representative, filed a complaint on May 11 alleging that the State Department of Banking and Ins. (JMC) and the New Jersey Department of Treasury (DOT) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b) thereunder. The court also found that the bonds were not subject to any obligations under the federal securities laws and that the JMC had a separate source of revenue to pay for the renovation.  The court further ruled that the bond issue was moot because the bonds had already been sold.  In a parallel action, on May 12, 2017 the New York State Division of Property Management and Construction (DPMC) issued a bond resolution approving a $38 million exterior repair of the SHC. The bond resolution also authorized the sale of bonds in the amount of $42.775 million, a bond that financed previous projects at the State Capitol complex.  As alleged in the complaint, the bonds did not create a financial obligation for the State, and neither the state nor the DPMC were obligated to pay the bonds.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws, ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Daniel A. Kasper, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit. The examination that led to the discovery of the bonds was conducted by John Rymas, under the supervision of Robert A. Hannan. The investigation was supervised by Amy C. Hershfang of the Philadelphia Regional Office, with the assistance of Joseph G. Sansone, Regional Director of the Department of Justice's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, and Trial Counsel Robert C. McKinley of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u00c2\u00a0 The case has been supervised by Ms. Hannfang. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the N.J. Attorney General's Office, the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation."
