  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against Indianapolis-based real estate developer Indy Diamond, LLC in contempt of court for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, alleges that from July 2012 through August 2013, Indy Diamond failed to secure and maintain the Real Estate in accordance with the municipal code.  According to the complaint, in addition to failing to secure the real Estate, the complaint alleges that in both February 2016 and June 2016, the trial court issued an order requiring Indy Diamond to remove all residents from the real estate, remove trash and debris from the property, and maintain it in a safe and sanitary condition.  As alleged, the court's order also imposed a civil contempt order against Indy Diamond for failing to comply with the court order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Indianapolis Diamond.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Indianapolis Diamond consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $30,000, and orders the destruction of any building deemed to be in violation of the federal law. The judgment also imposes a $10,000 civil penalty against Indianapolis and a $20,000 officer-and-director bar.  Indianapolis Diamond has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction, with the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Amy C. McKinley of the U. S. District Judge's Office in Indianapolis entered a court order suspending the suspension of the demolition order. The court subsequently granted the city's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the demolition of the building.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 521, 526, 188 N.E.2d (Ind. Ct. App. 2015).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Indiana Department of Business and Neighborhood Services in this matter."
