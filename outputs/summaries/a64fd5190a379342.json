Geren, the Chairman of the Committee on House Administration, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an injunction, and an order requiring Geren to issue a press pass pursuant to Rule 5 of the Texas House of Representatives.  According to the court's order, Geren violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17(b)(2) thereunder.  Geren also was ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Geren.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, charges Geren with violating the anti-fraud and reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 5b2-1.

Burt and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter in the Fort Worth Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Secretary of State's Office, and the Texas Attorney General's Office in this matter."
