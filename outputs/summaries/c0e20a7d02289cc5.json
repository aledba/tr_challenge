  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Kenneth Benjamin, who was the designated beneficiary of his sister\u2019s disability benefits, violated Section 405(h) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Benjamin filed for bankruptcy in May 2017, alleging that the Social Security Administration (SSA) collected $6,000 from him illegally and in violation of its own regulations.  Benjamin also alleged that the SSA did not consider his request for a waiver of the overpayment and instead withheld the remainder of the money until it had recovered the overpayments.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Financial Regulation (OFINRA) today announced that it had issued an order requiring SSA to repatriate the remaining $536 in ill-gotten gains with interest.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Benjamin consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $19,286.90, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  It also orders Benjamin to pay a $20,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  Finally, the court granted Benjamin a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from associating with any entity that has jurisdiction over a claim arising under the federal law, and ordered him to comply with a court order requiring him to provide a copy of the final judgment.  On May 24, 2019, the SEC filed a civil action in the United States District Court against Benjamin, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security policy, including Social Security and Medicare.
