  "summary": "On December 21, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Keith Roman Henderson, Jr., a former DEA confidential informant who was convicted of distribution of more than 50 grams of cocaine base in violation of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, on August 3, 2010, Henderson was indicted on one count of conspiracy to distribute over 50 grams (\u201ccrack\u201d) of crack cocaine base. The court found that Henderson was liable for a total of 11.76 kilograms of the drug, 11.34 grams of crack, and a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years.  The court also ruled that Henderson had a prior felony drug conviction and that he was subject to an enhanced penalty based upon the nature of the alleged drug.  In a parallel action, on March 28, 2017, the United States District Court in New York granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Henderson to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.  On May 14, 2019, the Honorable Paul G. Mascianica of the United Kingdom entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Henderson from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay an $8,500 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Henderson consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of five years, up to a maximum of forty years imprisonment.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, charges Henderson with violating Section 404 of the First Step Act of 2010, and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order requiring him to surrender his passport.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5194 (January 24, 2019).  The Court also issued an order suspending Henderson from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any drug, including crack, for a period of three years, with the option to revoke or suspend the suspension pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
