  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Arizona today announced criminal charges against Steven Morgan, a divorced father who began to sexually abuse his ten-year-old daughter L.M. on weekends that she was in his care.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, Morgan began to groom his daughter for sexual abuse by having her dress characters \u201cmore sexy\u201d in an online fashion game she liked to play; this soon escalated to having her view online pornography.  The complaint alleges that the prosecutor improperly vouched by telling the jury that Morgan had committed various sexual conduct with a minor, that he had engaged in child molestation, and that the defendant had a character trait giving rise to an aberrant sexual propensity to commit the offense.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Morgan put his hand on the victim\u2019s vagina or made her masturbate in his presence by inserting vibrators he had provided to her.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Morgan consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 49.5 years.  Morgan also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil monetary penalty of 50.5 percent, and a penny stock bar.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Arizona Office of the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Arizona Department of Banking and Securities."
