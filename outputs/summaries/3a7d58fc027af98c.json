  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Husband for defrauding his wife by failing to disclose the post-trial agreements to sell Centennial Square, LLC, a shopping center located in Idaho.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Hawaii, Husband and his wife, Sharon LaPeter, agreed to settle the charges by agreeing to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Husband to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of the equalization payment owed to Wife.  The settlement is subject to court approval.  In its judgment, the court found that Husband had violated the pre-judgment provisions of the federal securities laws, and that he had breached the duty to disclose those provisions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the family court also ordered that the settlement be subject to a court-ordered injunction.  Husband also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and ordered to pay $1,000,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a $400,000 civil penalty.  On November 15, 2013, the Family Court issued an order suspending Husband from appearing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to comply with the court's order.  As set forth in the order, the Court also suspended Husband's right to reapply after the court finds him liable for violating the anti-fraud provisions in Section 5 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") and Rules 5b-8, 13a-14, 13b2-1, and 14a-13 thereunder.  It also ordered Husband not to participate in the offering of a penny stock or in the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Ms. Bort and Mr. Werner."
