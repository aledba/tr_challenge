  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against Mercury General Corp. (\"Mercury\"), a California-based insurance company, and its owner, Bruce McGregor, in a personal injury action.  According to the court's order, on July 11, 2010, Timory McDaniel, driving while intoxicated, entered the intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and East Second Street in Long Beach, California, and hit Barickman and Mcinteer, who were in a crosswalk with the insurance company.  The court found that Timory was entitled to an offset of $15,000 per person from a settlement offered by the company, but, on advice of counsel, did not accept the settlement offer.  Instead, the court ordered Timory to pay a total of $2.2 million plus $800,000 in prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $3 million.  In a parallel action, on January 13, 2011, a federal district court in Manhattan entered a judgment against Timory for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

On February 24, 2011 the court issued a judgment ordering Mercury to pay $2 million in disgorgement, $1 million in civil penalties, and a $1.5 million civil penalty.  After a hearing on February 26, 2012, the Court of Appeals for the Central Valley Division of Criminal Justice held that Mercury violated the duty to settle and the obligation to consider the interests of its insured in settling a civil action and release the insured from liability. The court also ordered that the company pay a $10,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the company consented to the judgment, which was entered without prejudice to the parties' motion for a preliminary injunction and the amount of any civil penalty to be determined by the court upon motion of the court.   The judgment also ordered the company to pay Barickmans, Timinteer and McGregor $1,500 each, plus $600,000 for each of the injured, and to provide a copy of the judgment to the injured.  Finally, the judgment requires the insurance companies to pay civil penalties in the amounts of the judgments that the court finds reasonable and reasonable.  For example, the complaint alleges that Timonteer agreed to a settlement that was not unreasonable and did not preclude"
