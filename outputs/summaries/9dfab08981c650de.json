  "summary": "On January 9, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against Sunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals, L.P., a Delaware-based company that owns and operates a crude oil refinery in Marcus Hook Borough, Delaware County, Pennsylvania.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Sunoco agreed to the entry of an order requiring it to submit a plan approval for the Marcus Hook facility. The order required that Sunoco submit a Plan Approval E, which is intended to be aggregated with existing and future projects, and that it should aggregate the emissions from those projects with those of the other projects. The court also ordered that the EHB consider whether the proposed plan approval should be included as part of a \"pre-dated\" plan approval.  The court's order, which was entered on February 8, 2019 and unsealed on March 4, 2020, requires Sunoco to respond to the Commission's order by providing an explanation for why it should not be included in the plan approval, and by providing a basis for the Commission to consider whether it should consider combining the emissions of the two projects.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Delaware today announced criminal charges against the company. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Natalie Tulloch-Reid and Patrick Cawley of the Philadelphia Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Daniel R. Schuckers. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Quality and the Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General."
