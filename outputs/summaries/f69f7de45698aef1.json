  "summary": "On August 23, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its Department of Justice (DOJ) in an emergency action to halt the processing of MAVNI naturalization applications.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York on July 7, 2017 and unsealed on August 24, 2017 in the United States District Court in Manhattan, the defendants claimed that the Department Of Justice had issued a security screening Requirement (SQR) that required applicants to pass a background check before they could be deemed eligible to naturalize.  The complaint further alleged that the SQR was not a legislative rule because it imposed no substantive obligations on the applicants.  In addition, the complaint alleges that DOD has stopped issuing N-426s to MAVI recruits who have not yet attended Initial Qualifications (IFRS) and DOD is reviewing whether to revoke those N\u2013426s.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval, and ordered them to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court.

It further alleges that the defendants have failed to adequately demonstrate that DOD is performing its duty as required under the MVA's background check and that DOD's enhanced security screening requirements are unreasonable.  Further, the SEC alleges that defendants have violated Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2) of\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act\u00c2\u00a0and Rule 15a-3 thereunder.
