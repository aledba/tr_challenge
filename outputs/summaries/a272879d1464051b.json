  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against Bridgeport Police Department officers who were charged with misconduct in connection with a citizen complaint.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bridgeport, Connecticut on January 24, 2020, alleges that, from at least December 21, 1973 through the present, Bridgeport officers engaged in a systematic pattern of conduct, consisting of a large number of individual acts of violence, intimidation, and humiliation.  According to the complaint, the officers violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(3) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  In addition, the complaint alleges that the officers in question were not named or referred to in the complaint and that they were not subject to the disciplinary procedures outlined in the Barros Decree.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the officers involved in the alleged misconduct.  On January 26, 2019, the Honorable Board of Police Commissioners issued an order appointing an independent arbitrator to determine whether to impose civil penalties and/or forfeitures as a result of the Commission's findings.   The Commission's order appointing the arbitrator is subject to approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 24-7 (January 24, 2017).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant a number of officers who have been suspended or criminally charged for misconduct in the past, including, without limitation, for refusing to provide proper medical attention to a child with a skinned knee or for refusing a band-aid to a victim of a traffic accident.  It also alleges that a defendant who has been criminally charged with a similar conduct has a right to a hearing and to be held liable for his/her conduct.  Finally, the Commission has issued an Order appointing a Special Master to review and resolve any issues that arise arising from this conduct. The Commission has also issued a Request for a Temporary Restraining Order, which requires officers to submit written and oral statements to the Commission as to the severity of their misconduct, and to provide an accounting of their disciplinary history. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation was conducted by Joseph Cruz, Douglas Bepko, Matthew Johnson, and Joseph Pires, and was supervised by"
