  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against Boston Boat Basin, LLC, a Massachusetts-based company that owns and operates an inn and marina on Boston harbor, in contempt of a 2006 court order requiring the company to comply with certain property use restrictions.  The court found that Boston Boat violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder, and entered a temporary restraining order, without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, that the company violated the federal trust doctrine.  In its complaint, Boston Boat, which was filed in July of 2011, alleged that it was bound by a 2006 preliminary injunction that imposed certain restrictions on the use of the locus.  According to the complaint, the court found Boston Boat liable for violating those restrictions because the company had no relationship with the prior owner of record and had not succeeded to any of its liabilities.  Boston Boat's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts, charges the company with violating Section 17 (a) and (b) of Securities Act Section 10(b) and 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rules 10b-20, 13b2-1, and 13a-13 thereunder. Boston Boat has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David Birchall and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office, and the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office in this matter."
