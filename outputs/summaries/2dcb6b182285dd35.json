  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against Golden Day Schools, Inc. (\"Golden Day\"), a nonprofit corporation founded by Clark and Jeanette Parker that provides daycare, education, and social development services to low-income children in South Central Los Angeles.  Golden Day's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that Golden Day violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it was precluded from conducting an independent financial and compliance audit after accepting the Department of Education's findings.  The complaint further alleges that the Department's own performance audit, which was conducted by an independent licensed certified public accountant, was not conducted by Golden Day.  According to the complaint, Golden Day failed to meet its obligation to recoup all of the allegedly ill-gotten gains with the assistance of independent auditors.  In addition, the complaint alleges Golden Day did not comply with certain of the requirements of the federal contracts, including that it reimburse certain of its employees for commingling eligible and noneligible students, certain payroll costs for employees who also worked at a separate unrelated entity, and various nonreimbursable costs (the Department's Findings Nos. 2, 4, and 5).  The SEC's complaint charges Golden Day with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's case, GoldenDay has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws, orders it to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.5 million, and orders the payment of a $1 million civil penalty to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  It has also agreed to pay a $500,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for the rest of the school year.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Los Angeles Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Ms. Curt, and the case is being supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and the Office of Inspector General."
