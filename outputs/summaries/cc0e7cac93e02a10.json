  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Rhode Island today entered a final judgment in favor of a former Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education employee who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Paul E. Pontarelli sought access to records in RIDE's possession pursuant to the Access to Public Records Act (APRA) in violation of Rule 12(b)(6) and that he was entitled to access to those records.  According to the complaint, however, the requested records were not related to the statutory mission of RIDE, but to the private law practice of a RIDE employee.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, RIDE agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Rhode Island announced criminal charges against the two defendants.  On May 24, 2015, the Honorable Deborah A. Gist of the federal district court in Providence issued a temporary restraining order halting the filing of a motion for summary judgment against the defendants, and ordered RIDE to comply with the court's order by issuing a cease-and-desist order and appointing a receiver to oversee the collection and processing of the requested documents.  RIDE also agreed to pay a penalty of $100,000, which will be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the SEC.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2016, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  To learn more about this matter, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (R.I. 1999).  The case was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone, Regional Director of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Rhode Island Secretary of State's Office, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
