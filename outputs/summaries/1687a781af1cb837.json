  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Timothy D. Davis for his role in a September 2016 domestic violence case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that Davis was falsely told by a trial judge that he had been involved in a fight with police in September 2016. The complaint alleges that the judge mischaracterized the nature of the alleged fight, and that Davis had resisted arrest or fought with police. Davis allegedly had been confronted by officers who confronted him at the home of his mother, a minister, who had asked for a meal and who, while of somewhat darker skin color than Davis, was of roughly the same height and build, with a \"fade\" haircut. According to the complaint, Davis resisted arrest and fought with officers, and the officers confronted him. The defendants agreed to settle the case by agreeing to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. Davis also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in a real estate investment.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about potential scams targeting investors. The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the SEC's Investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor alert system to quickly spot signs of suspicious activity.  For example, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Virginia issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the securities laws, including whether there are any securities laws that require investors to report suspicious activity to the SEC.  On May 3, 2019, Judge Burt issued a temporary restraining order against Davis, ordering him to surrender his passport, pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and have his passport inspected by the SEC before proceeding with the trial."
