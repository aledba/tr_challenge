  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against CMS, finding that the agency violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by not properly reviewing the agency's findings.  The court also entered a judgment against the hospital, agreeing that it was entitled to summary judgment.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington D.C. on August 22, 2016, the court found that CMS violated the APA when it failed to consider the hospital's request for equitable relief in its FY 2015 payment determination.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that CMS had agreed to a two-percent reduction in the amount of Medicare payments to a Long-Term Care Hospitals (LTCH) that it deemed \"harmless.\"  The complaint also alleges that, in reaching its decision, the agency improperly cited a 2013 final rule for reconsideration of a CMS payment determination for the same year, costing the hospital almost $300,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the hospital consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins the agency from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of two-thirds of a million dollars.  PAM Squared also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization for five years, and to a five-year officer-and-director bar.  It also agreed that the court will determine whether to impose a penalty on the hospital based on its findings in its case.  On August 24, 2018, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of the hospital and ordered it to comply with the court's order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Caring Hearts Advocacy, Inc. (A.L. Pharma, Inc.) and the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  The litigation will be led by Mr. Gorsuch and Ms. Hargan. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in this matter."
