  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against Charlotte-based Cities4Life, Inc. and its Executive Director, Daniel Parks, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that the City of Charlotte and the Department of Housing and Neighborhood Services (DCE) violated the First Amendment of the federal securities laws by failing to enforce certain of the provisions of \u00a710-141 of the Exchange Act.  According to the complaint, Parks and the DCE violated Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, and that Parks violated Section 15(b)(2)(A) and 15(c)(3)(B)(3) thereunder of Section 16(a)(1) and (3) of Rule 16a-1.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the First and Second Amendment, and ordering them to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Parks.  On November 11, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Parks, charging him with violations of Section 12(b).  The complaint also charges Parks and DCE with violating Sections 13(e) and 13(c) of The Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13e-3, and 13d-1 thereunder and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a).  In addition, the complaint charges Parks, DCE, and the Charlotte Division of Code Enforcement with violating Section 14(e)(1)(A)(2) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder under Section 15e-4 thereunder (a) and Section 16 (b)(5)(B) and with violating Exchange Act Section 13e2-3 and Rule 14e-1, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.
