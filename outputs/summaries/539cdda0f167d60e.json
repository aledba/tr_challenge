  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against a California man accused of stealing a pair of pants and leaving the store alone without paying for the pants.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that C.H. entered a department store with two friends and left the store without submitting a sample. When confronted by a loss prevention officer, he brandished a knife and kicked the officer in the head.  According to the complaint, the officer and the defendant agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in favor of the defendants, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and provide for an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to permanent injunctions, to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws, and to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any state-level agency for at least five years, from participating in the issuance of any federal law, including the right to reapply as an officer or director of a public agency after five years of service. The court also ordered the defendants to submit fingerprints and DNA samples to the state's DNA and Forensic Identification Database and Databank, which is intended to be used by law enforcement to detect and identify potential violators of the above-mentioned provisions. The defendants also agreed to pay civil injunctions against future violations.  On May 2, 2018, the U. S. District Court in the Eastern District of Washington entered a judgment ordering the imposition of a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 299 of the Exchange Act. The judge granted the defendants\u2019 requests for an injunction and ordered them to comply with the court\u2019s order.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2019, is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Office of Criminal Investigations."
