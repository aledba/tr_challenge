  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against two doctors in a medical malpractice action brought by the Marshalls.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that Dr. Kenneth Dodds and his nephrologist, Georgia Roane, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 15-3-545 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  According to the complaint, Dodds was negligent in failing to recognize that the continued use of medication designed to reduce protein levels was not effective, as revealed by tests in February and September of 2005.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Dodds negligently failed to properly monitor her response to Diovan, which is typically prescribed for hypertension, and failed to order additional testing after the proteinuria was detected.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering Dodds to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering Roane to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Roane has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the securities laws and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public health organization, and from participating in any future offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock at any time.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 21, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Office of Compliance and Regulatory Affairs. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maryland Office of Inspector General, and the Maryland Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
