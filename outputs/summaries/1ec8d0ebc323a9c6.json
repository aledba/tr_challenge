  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Third Judicial District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against a Marion, Louisiana man accused of orchestrating an armed robbery.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that on September 3, 2014, the Marion Police Department conducted a warrantless search of the home of Chastity Williams and her boyfriend, Roderick Hillard. The complaint alleges that Williams and Hillard entered the home through a window and entered the house through a back door. According to the complaint, Williams told the officers that she was going to the house to steal $1,300 from Hillard, and that Hillard had been at her house the day before the robbery. Williams allegedly told the intruders that the money was in her pants to get them to leave the house.  Williams allegedly replied that he hoped he was found guilty and they were going to shoot him.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the District of New Orleans today entered a temporary restraining order against Williams, Hillard and the other intruders. The court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered Williams to comply with the court's order, and ordered Hillard to surrender his passport. Hillard consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint filed in the SEC, Williams agreed to the imposition of a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Inspector General, and the Office of the Chief of Police in this matter."
