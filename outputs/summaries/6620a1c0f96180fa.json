  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Chester A. Appellant, a convicted felon who was previously sentenced to prison for drug possession, for orchestrating a drug-delivery scheme that resulted in the death of an elderly woman.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, Pennsylvania, on April 17, 2017, Appellants, who was incarcerated at the Erie County Prison, told his girlfriend, Olivia Askins, that she would find the drugs in the glove box of his Mercedes Benz when she could find them. Askins' death was a direct result of the drug delivery.  The complaint further alleges that, in instructing Askins to contact his father for safekeeping until he could get out of jail and deliver the drugs to her, he directed her to go on Facebook to interact with Askins.  Askins ultimately died from an overdose.

On December 5, 2018, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of the evidence in this matter.
