  "summary": "On October 5, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon entered final consent judgments against Willamette Oaks, LLC and Alexander Loop, LLC in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Eugene, Oregon, alleges that, in May 2017, Willammette Oaks filed an emergency action to preserve the status of the Goodpasture Island Planned Unit Development (PUD).  According to the complaint, in 2010, the city of Eugene granted final PUD approval for the development of the PUD, which required the use of the ITE Manual to calculate the number of trips generated by an apartment building in a specific phase.  In 2011, the hearing officer found that, if calculated according to the required ITE use codes, Phase 5 exceeded the trip cap in Condition 3.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the court agreed that Phase 5 complied with the condition of the PUD, and that it did not require the building of a PUD to exceed the trip caps.   The complaint further alleges that in denying the city\u2019s request for a second assignment of error, the hearings officer failed to determine whether Phase 5 was compliant with Condition 3, or whether it was an error to apply the \"trip cap\" as set out in the final judgment.  Finally, the complaint alleges that the hearings officers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Willamettes Oaks has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires it to comply with a court order requiring a hearing officer to consider the merits of a case before it is decided by the court.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On October 6, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint in the federal district court for the Eastern District of Washington, alleging that Willammettes Oaks violated the federal, state, and local securities laws by failing to adequately record the facts of the case before the court, including the fact that the court had previously issued an order requiring hearing officers to consider whether a building permit should be issued for a particular type of apartment building.  It also alleged that the hearing officers failed to record that the city had already agreed with the finding of the court that it was not obligated to issue building permits for that building, in order to avoid mitigation and other obligations the TPR would otherwise require.
