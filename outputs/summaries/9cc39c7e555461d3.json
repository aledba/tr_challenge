  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alaska today entered a final judgment against the Public Defender Agency (PDA) and the Department of Public Advocacy (DOA) in an emergency action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Anchorage, Alaska, alleges that, in 2013, the Alaska Attorney General and Department of Justice issued an order requiring the agency to pay the travel expenses of an out-of-custody juvenile defendant to the site of his adjudication hearing.

The final judgment also prohibits DJJ from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a court order or order, and bars DJJ, PDA, OPA, and OPA from violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(2)(A) and 17(b)(B)(B).
