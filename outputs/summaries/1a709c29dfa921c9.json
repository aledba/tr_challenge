  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered final judgments in favor of a miner who was suspended with intent to discharge for insubordination in 2015 after several incidents with a mine supervisor.  The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and a civil penalty.  According to the court's order, filed on September 3, 2016, Harrison County Coal Co. (\u201cHarrison\u201d) suspended George Scoles, a coal miner, for failing to comply with Section 105(c) of the Mine Act. The court found that Scoles engaged in multiple activities under the Act, including filing three discrimination complaints over several years, making a series of health and safety complaints to supervisors, and reporting to Harrison management the September 3 \"head-butt\" of Scoles on September 8 that he felt harassed. Scoles also allegedly told Harrison management that, to the best of his knowledge, he could have worked 42 days during his 61-day suspension.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Scoles. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Scoles with violating Section 105, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Scoles consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 105 and orders him to pay $16,324.80 plus interest, a $40,000 civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The order also prohibits Scoles from participating in mining-related activities, including making any safety-related complaints, and from making any disciplinary decisions. The complaint also seeks a court order requiring Scoles to pay a penalty equal to the amount of backpay he received.  On September 8, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint with the SEC alleging that Harrison violated Section 105 by suspending Scoles in 2015, and ordering him to make an independent assessment of all the statutory factors, including whether there was sufficient evidence to support the SEC\u2019s finding that he had engaged in a protected activity under Section 105 to be able to file a complaint.  As a result of the SEC finding, the court granted the complaint and ordered the SEC to issue an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue a subpoena for the receiver, ordering the receiver to send a copy of the subpoena to the receiver. The receiver has agreed to the appointment of a receiver and to the payment of a $20,000 penalty."
