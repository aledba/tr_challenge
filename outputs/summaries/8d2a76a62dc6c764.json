  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Cimarex Energy Co. of Colorado, its former owner, Ethel Marie Pummill, Jr., and her husband, Chris Parrish, in a parallel action.  According to the court's order, filed in October 2011, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that defendants failed to meet their obligations under the leases to pay royalty on gas produced from the 1-32 well at the wellhead or in the manufacture of products at the gas plant.  In addition, the court found that the defendants had failed to adequately represent to royalty owners that the gas was a marketable product, and that they had overpaid for the gas.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their profits.  On November 5, 2014, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Mascianica entered a judgment against the defendants, permanently enjoining them from future violations of the securities laws and ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. McArthur and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oklahoma Department of Natural Resources, and the Oklahoma Corporation Commission in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly and easily identify whether they are registered professionals."
