  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against former New York State Assemblyman Sheldon Silver, who was convicted of extortion under color of right under the federal bribery laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Silver violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Silver agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  Silver also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency and to pay a civil penalty of $1,750,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Silver for his role in a scheme that defrauded two New York real estate developers out of more than $1 million.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Silver violated Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0The Exchange Act and Rule\u00c2\u00a010b2 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc.   The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Silver.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the U.N. District Judge's Office in Manhattan entered a judgment against Silver that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay $1.5 million in disgorgment, and orders Sansone to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting the SEC\u2019s allegations, Silver consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions, ordering him to disgorge $1 billion in illegal fees, and imposing a $10 million civil penalty against him.  Sansone agreed to a $50,000 penalty and a $100,000 officer and director bar.  Ganim agreed to pay the penalty in a parallel administrative proceeding, which is subject to court approval.  Sousone, Sansone and Sansone also agreed not to pay any civil penalties, and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged scheme.  Finally, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order against Silver and ordered him to comply with the court order requiring him to surrender his passport.
