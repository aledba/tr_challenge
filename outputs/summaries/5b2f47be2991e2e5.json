  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against Charles Castle, a Kentucky man accused of sexually assaulting two of his daughters.  According to the court's order, filed on September 29, 2017, Charles was verbally and mentally abusive for eight years of his marriage with Robin Castle, his wife of eight years, and A.H. and O.H., her twin teenage daughters from a prior marriage.  The court found that Charles had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and entered the DVO without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In addition, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Charles from violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  On October 27, 2018, the trial court granted Charles' request for an emergency restraining order (DVO) against Robin Castle and her twin daughters, and ordered Charles to comply with the entry of a DVO. The court also granted Charles the right to a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  To learn more about domestic violence and abuse, see Litigation Release No. 17-20-2017.  For additional information about DVO proceedings, see Press Release No: 17-22-2017 (Feb. 26, 2018).
