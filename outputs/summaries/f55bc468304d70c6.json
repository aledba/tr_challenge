  "summary": "On November 13, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a New York City-based company and its owner-president for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that the New York State Department of Labor passed a law in 2008 that, in effect at the time, prohibited out-of-state contractors from bidding on public construction contracts.  According to the complaint, the law also imposed so-called \"apprenticeship requirements\" on certain public contracts, which are not uniform across the state.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2008, the state legislature passed a bill that raised the $50,000 threshold for certain public contracting contracts, and that the new, higher threshold was an unreasonable restriction on the amount of work that could be performed.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the anti-fraud provisions and order them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amounts of their profits.  Finally, the court agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to the imposition of a civil penalty of $100,000.  It also ordered the company to pay a $20,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  On November 16, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, charging them with violating Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rules 10b2-1, 2-6, 14, and 13a-13 thereunder.  As part of the settlement, the company agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, from participating in any type of public construction work, and from providing any financial assistance to the company or its affiliated entity in the event of an emergency.  Additionally, the district court ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million and $500,000, respectively, for violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an injunction, and an officer and director bar against further violations of the above-mentioned provisions, and a penny stock bar against each defendant."
