  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Donald Thomas Perrin, Jr., a convicted felon, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Durham, North Carolina, Perrin was previously on probation for possessing child pornography and was required to register as a sex offender. The court imposed a special condition of supervised release prohibiting Perrin from accessing the internet without the prior approval of a probation officer. Perrin agreed to the condition without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and was sentenced to 360 months imprisonment and 120 months imprisonment, to run consecutively to one another.  The court also ordered Perrin to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $500,000 officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced criminal charges against Perrin. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Packingham and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by David A. Schiff and supervised under the supervision of Amy C. Welshhans. The case is being supervised by Kelly L.
