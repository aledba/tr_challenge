  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendants Alonzo Grant and Stephanie Grant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that Grant and Grant violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") by failing to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims that Grant was entitled to a reasonable rate of attorney's fees when, in fact, he was not entitled to any reasonable rate at all.  In addition, Grant's attorney, Charles Bonner, has agreed to settle the SEC's charges against him by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay $1,560,365.00 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and orders Bonner to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Grant consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 5(b).  The judgment also prohibits Grant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any security or other security measure, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On October 23, 2018, the court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered Grant to surrender his passport, which he obtained through a court-ordered search of his home, to be returned to him in a timely manner.  According to the order, Grant also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to a three-year conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from associating with any third party in a civil proceeding.  As a result, Grant will be permanently barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and will be subject to a bar and a court order requiring him to provide a copy of the complaint to the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 17(b)(5) and Judgment No. 206 (2d Cir. 2009).  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
