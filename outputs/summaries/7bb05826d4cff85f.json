  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a former county commissioner for her alleged dereliction of her duty to maintain the roads in her subdivision.  The SEC's complaint alleges that in March of 2000, Prairie View Enterprises (\u201cthe developer\u201d) began to develop Prairie View Estates, a subdivision in Wise County, Texas. According to the complaint, the developer presented its final plat for the subdivision to the county commissioners court in August 2000. The plat described several roads and stated that the roads were dedicated to the public. The complaint alleges, however, that the county did not subsequently accept the dedication.  According to Mastropiero's complaint, as alleged, the commissioners court never accepted the dedication because the county had not subsequently maintained the roads.  Mastropi\u00c3\u0080\u0099s complaint, filed in federal district court in Texas, charges the county with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Masto. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against the county, charging Masto with violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Section 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Masto consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil monetary penalty of $1,000, and imposes a $25,000 civil penalty against her. Masto also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval. The court will determine the amount of restitution to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Department of Public Safety, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
