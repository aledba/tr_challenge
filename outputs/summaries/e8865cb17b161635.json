  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment in favor of a former management employee of the Summit County Board of Developmental Disabilities who was terminated for breach of contract in 2008.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, Kevin McGee was terminated on September 20, 2012, for failing to pay the required salary in the required amounts and at the required intervals.  The complaint alleges that McGee was overpaid for his leave in 2008 and 2011.  In 2012, the District Court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins McGee from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal contract, and orders him to pay $152.05 per day in the amount of $3,801.60 from the Board and $2,281.07 from the Department of Health and Human Services.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, McGee consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the anti-fraud provisions, and ordering him to sign a second, revised, and definitive contract in which he was entitled to a pay and military leave equal to the difference between his gross monthly salary and the sum of the employee's gross uniformed pay and allowances received that month.  McGee agreed to settle the case by consenting to entry of the final judgment without prejudice.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to his disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to find out more about Investor Alerts and how to spot suspicious activity. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint seeks a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against McGee. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Attorney General's Office in this matter."
