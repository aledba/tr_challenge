  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against Craig Denmead, a licensed Ohio licensed attorney, and his law firm for failing to properly serve an amended complaint.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the court's order, filed on February 6, 2015, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court lacked jurisdiction over the defendants.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(A) of Exchange Act Rules 5(b)(5) and (c) thereunder. The court granted the defendants' motion for leave to file an emergency action against each of them, and ordered the defendants to return their allegedly unregistered mail to the clerk of courts. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kelly L. Gibson, John Rymas, and Eric R. Werner of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Werner. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office, and the Ohio Attorney General's Office in this matter."
