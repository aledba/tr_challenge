  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Georgia announced today that it has obtained a court order halting an ongoing criminal case against two convicted criminals.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Gordon County, Georgia, alleges that, on September 12, 2012, Deputy Corey Tate with the Gordon County Sheriff's Office conducted a traffic stop in the median of Interstate 75, monitoring traffic.  According to the complaint, as part of his investigation, he observed a Chevrolet Impala pass by and noticed that there was no functioning tag light on the car.  As part of the investigation, the complaint alleges that the driver of the Impala allegedly told the deputy that he was going to use a peremptory strike to remove the passenger from the car, but the deputy did not see the substance in the car and did not respond to the deputy's question about whether he had handled the drug.  In a parallel action, the Georgia Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the two men.  On September 19, 2014, the SEC filed a final judgment against Hill, finding him liable for a civil injunctive action, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and bars them from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-registered broker-dealer.  Additionally, the court granted the motion for a temporary restraining order against Partlow and Hill, and ordered the SEC to conduct a parallel criminal investigation.    In its order, the Court also ordered the investigation to be conducted by the Office of the United States Attorney's Assistant Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations, with the assistance of the Atlanta Field Office's Office of Public Health and the Georgia Office of Inspector General's Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Atlanta field with assistance from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, and the Atlanta Office of Financial Regulation.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Georgia Department of Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the Atlanta Police Department, the Alabama Department of Banking and Securities and the Alabama Office of Criminal Justice."
