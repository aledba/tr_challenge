  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against a Vermilion County, Illinois-based landfill operator.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on November 12, 2018, Brickyard Disposal & Recycling, Inc. (Brickyard) and its owner, E&E Hauling, Inc., filed applications to expand the boundaries of a previously permitted pollution control facility. The complaint alleges that the agency improperly issued a permit for the expansion of the existing facility and failed to consider the technical merits of the application.  The complaint further alleges that Brickyard's application was incomplete because it failed to obtain local siting approval for the planned expansion, failed to include a new or updated groundwater impact assessment (GIA), or failed to provide a \"local siting review\" for changes in waste volume within boundaries of existing landfills.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, B&H has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Environmental Quality, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
