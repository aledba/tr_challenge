  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found to have violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Napa, California, alleges that, in March 2018, a juvenile court entered an order imposing a temporary restraining order on a minor who had violated the anti-fraud provision of Section 903 of the federal securities laws. The court found that the restraining order imposed on the minor violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordered him to pay a $100,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to remain in the home of his mother and to be under the supervision of a probation officer. The final judgment also imposes a $75,000 penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on April 8, 2019, the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, imposed a $35,000 conduct-based injunction, and imposed a five-day suspension from appearing or practicing before the court. The SEC\u2019s Complaint charges the defendant with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The case is being handled by John Rymas and Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division in the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner, and supervised by Chedly C.
