  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jose Castillo of Chelsea, Massachusetts, who was convicted of second-degree murder in 2005.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that Castillo violated his right to due process of law and the pre-judgment provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  Castillo agreed to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, and the court granted Castillo's motion for a new trial.  In its order, the court entered a temporary restraining order and ordered Castillo to comply with the court's order. The court also issued an order suspending Castillo from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert witness.  According to the complaint, Castillo was not permitted to cross-examine one of the witnesses, Catea Travassas, and her sister, Lisette Santos. The complaint alleges that the defendant and Villanueva engaged in a verbal altercation during which the defendant allegedly kicked the victim in the head and kicked him in the face. The judge agreed to limit the defendant's cross-examination of the witness to prevent embarrassment and harassment, and to allow the defendant to return to the house and change his clothes.  On the same day, the jury deliberated for an hour and a half before finding Castillo liable for a second and final judgment. The final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2)(A) and (b)(5)(B)(3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. The order also prohibits Castillo and his co-defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, other than for the purpose of obtaining an injunction against future violations of the securities laws. In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against Castillo. The SEC is continuing its investigation into Castillo, and Castillo has agreed to a settlement that includes permanent injunctions, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar. In addition, the SEC is seeking a court order prohibiting Castillo"
