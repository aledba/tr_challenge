  "summary": "On March 19, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia entered a final judgment against Chancelier Fazili, a convicted felon who was sentenced to twenty years of probation.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Va., on March 18, 2017, Frazili was charged with object sexual penetration of a child under the age of thirteen, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.  The SEC alleges that Fazil initially stood charged with the same conduct and agreed to a five-year probation without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  As alleged, however, the court improperly delegated the responsibilities of this probation condition to the probation officer.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed criminal charges against him.  On August 9, 2018 the court issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order, which temporarily suspended the suspension of the suspension pending the outcome of the criminal case.  Without admitting to these violations, the SEC also issued a cease-and-desist order, imposing a permanent injunction, and imposing a conduct-based suspension of internet access for the remainder of his sentence.   The court's order temporarily halted the suspension and ordered the suspension to be followed by a hearing on August 21, 2018 to determine the amount of restitution to be paid to the victim. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Virginia Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Virginia Office of Inspector General.  For further information, see Press Release No. 17-20-20 (March 19, 2017).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Cyber Unit, with litigation assistance from Eric R. Werner, and assistance from the Office of Compliance and Enforcement's Office of Cyber and Risk Analysis."
