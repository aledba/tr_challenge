  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Social Security Administration (SSA) against Ruth Ellen Reeves, a former cashier, sales attendant, and customer service representative who was previously employed as a vocational expert.  The SEC's order against Reeves, filed in federal district court in New York, charges her with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.

The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order ordering the SEC to conduct an independent examination of all of its nominees for the post of Chief of the Commission on Disability and Economic and Risk Analysis. The Commission's order requires that the SEC consider all of the evidence submitted by the nominee before it makes a determination on whether or not to proceed to the next step of the disciplinary proceeding.  For example, the SEC previously issued an Order requiring that the Commission consider the evidence presented at the hearing before it issued its order, and that it had not yet concluded that Reeves could perform the duties of a cashier and sales attendant. The order also requires Reeves to submit two letters indicating that the consultative medical examinations were unnecessary, which she has not indicated the source or contents of those letters, and to make an adjustment to other work where the"
