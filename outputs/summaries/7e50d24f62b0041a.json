  "summary": "The California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing administrative proceeding against a California-based provider of autism-related services.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, on June 30, 2009, the state Attorney General's Office filed an emergency action against the provider of ABA services for autistic children.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of the federal securities laws, DMHC violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the attorney general's office has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins DMHC from violating these provisions and orders it to conduct a bifurcated grievance system and to return to its pre-March 2009 method of resolving complaints.  In a parallel action, the California Secretary of State's Office today announced criminal charges against the individual who filed the emergency action.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Health and Safety, with the assistance of the Office of Inspector General. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau and Ms. Mascianica. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the California Office of the Attorney General, the Department of Insurance, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
