  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Kansas today announced criminal charges against a Kansas probation violator.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Kansas, alleges that the Sedgwick County District Court improperly revoked the probation of a convicted felon.  According to the complaint, the court improperly granted the probationer's request for a hearing to determine if he or she was competent to participate in a revocation hearing.  In a parallel action, the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Missouri today announced that it would order a competency evaluation for a probation revocation hearing for defendant Rodrigo Gonzalez, who was sentenced to 52 months in prison and ordered to serve 52 months of probation.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Gonzalez had a history of mental illness and a related, though unidentified, seizure disorder that contributed to and mitigated his wrongful conduct in the jail.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Gonzalez consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of up to $100,000, a $25,000 officer-and-director bar, and a $50,000 civil penalty.  A hearing for Gonzalez is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time).  The court's order for Gonzalez to appear with a lawyer is subject to court approval.  For a hearing on consent, the judge will determine whether to order a hearing or revoke the probation for a certain period of time.  On a related administrative matter, the district court previously issued a temporary restraining order preventing Gonzalez from appearing before the court as a result of his prior felony convictions.  It also issued an order requiring a hearing officer and a neutral hearing officer to assess and report to the court whether a defendant has a reasonable chance of attaining competency at a revocation proceeding.  To learn more about the due process provisions of the federal criminal laws, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 1755 (2014).  In addition, the SEC complaint charges Gonzalez with violating the due-process provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(e) the federal securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Separately, the federal district court issued a preliminary injunction against Gonzalez and ordered him to comply with the court's orders."
