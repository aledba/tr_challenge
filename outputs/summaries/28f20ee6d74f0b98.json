  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of first-degree premeditated murder and attempted second-degree murder in the same case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Port Orchard, New York, alleges that, on March 28, 2015, a day after learning that his wife had been kidnapped and robbed, DeJesus told her that a man with a gun made him drive his borrowed Jeep to an automated teller machine and take out money. The complaint alleges that DeJesus then told his wife, Jalisa Lum, that he had a gun and that he was going to use it to commit the crime. According to the complaint, however, the defendant did not have the means or the capability to use the gun. Instead, he allegedly used a combination of lies and deceit to convince the jury that the gun was a reasonable option. The SEC alleges that the jury found DeJesus guilty on all of these counts, and DeJesus was sentenced to life imprisonment without the right to a fair trial.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against DeJesus.  On March 31, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court in New York charging DeJesus with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits DeJesus from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordered DeJesus to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  DeJesus consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $7,500. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (March 29, 2016)."
