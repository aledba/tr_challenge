  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against John O'Connor and Hildis M. O' Connor in a case that was investigated by the SEC.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that, in 1979, the O'Corsairs and O'Rearns raised the issue of whether a power of appointment should be exercised by a person or entity who has a legitimate claim to the power.  According to the complaint, John's will, which was filed in August 1984, expressly stated that he would exercise the power by providing for his wife's benefit.  In addition, the complaint alleges that John drafted a will in which he made no reference at all to any power granted to him by the trust or trusts established by his parents or any other trusts for which he had a right to an appointment.    The complaint further alleges that the will included a provision that required John to make a specific reference to the \"power of appointment\" in his will.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, John consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, and to pay a civil penalty of $5,000.  John also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to be prohibited from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the name of any public company, other than for his own personal benefit, for a period of at least five years.  Additionally, the final judgment orders that John bequeath and devise all of his estate assets to his wife, who is entitled to a share of the estate in a trust or trust established by her parents for her benefit, and that he bequeathed the estate to her as a condition to exercising the power granted under the trust.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 632, No. 559, (Sept. 1, 1984).  The Commission's complaint charges John with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and seeks permanent injunctions against future violations of the federal securities laws, civil penalties against John, and an officer and director bar against John"
