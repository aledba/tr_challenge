  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Joel Rivera for aiding and abetting a pair of Hobbs Act robberies and his friend's use of a firearm during them. The same jury, however, acquitted him of, or deadlocked on, counts related to three other robberies.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, on January 4, 2017, a jury found Rivera guilty on all of the charges.  The SEC alleges that the jury deliberated for nearly two hours before finding him guilty on the four counts of robbery and on the firearm counts for the last two robberies. The court also found that Rivera was a necessary participant because he supplied the van with the stolen merchandise and carried the same gun that he had given him for the other robberies, and that he did not know in advance that Thomas would use a gun during the robberies. In addition, the court found that Thomas had a \"meltdown\" as a result not of lying, but rather of being frustrated with counsel's questions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Rivera.  On January 9, 2018, a federal district court in Manhattan entered a judgment of acquittal against Rivera, finding him liable on all the charges, ordering him to pay a total of 432 months in prison, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The court granted the court's motion for a new trial on the basis of the evidence presented at the trial, which was conducted in the absence of any evidence, and ordered him to comply with the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Rivera consented to a judgment against him that imposes a permanent injunction, prohibits him from participating in any future conduct, and orders him to be restrained and ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $600,000 and $100,000, respectively.   The jury also found Thomas liable on the three other counts of Robbery in which he was convicted, and for the three Family Dollar store robberies and the firearm use for those robberies."
