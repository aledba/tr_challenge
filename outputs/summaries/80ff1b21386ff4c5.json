  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered final judgments against ADP, LLC and its management consulting firm, Saturn Wireless Consulting, LLC, for violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered judgments ordering ADP to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Newark, New Jersey, ADP imposed restrictive covenants on certain of its sales employees in order to protect client relationships. The complaint alleges that ADP violated these provisions by failing to comply with certain of the requirements of the federal securities laws, including the requirement that all sales employees be required to participate in a stock-option award program.  In a parallel action, the New Jersey Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against one of ADP's sales employees. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rafferty of the New York Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Birkenheier. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and whether they have any background in the field. The Office of Compliance has also issued an Investor Alert about potential conflicts of interest arising from this conduct.   The SEC encourages investors to be aware of the risks of investing in a business by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's investor.gov\u00a0to quickly identify which companies may be at risk of losing millions of dollars of investor money.  For example, the SEC encourages employees to use\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov to quickly and accurately identify whether their employer has a legitimate business interest and why they should not be penalized for not participating in the stock award program\u00c2\u00a0if the employer is not required to provide the same services as those which they provided to ADP\u00c2\u00a0as part of their compensation\u00c2\u00a0for the same employer.  Investor.gov has\u00c2\u00a0issued\u00c2\u00a0a\u00c2\u00a0statement\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0states\u00c2"
