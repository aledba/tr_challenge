  "summary": "On August 29, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington entered a final judgment against Specialty Asphalt & Construction LLC and its majority owner, Lisa Jacobsen for gender discrimination, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of contract arising out of the County\u2019s bidding and contracting process for a paving project.  The court found that Specialty, a licensed contractor that performs paving and maintenance work in Lincoln County, Washington, was entitled to a summary judgment against the County for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its judgment, the court also ordered Specialty to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of its civil penalties.  According to the court's order, Specialty consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, which was filed in federal district court in Seattle.  Specialty also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The court granted Specialty's motion for summary judgment and ordered a hearing on the matter on August 30, 2017.  On August 31, 2017 Specialty filed a civil injunctive action against the county, charging it with violations of the anti-discrimination provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  It also obtained a temporary restraining order, which prohibits Specialty from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any materials or services, and an officer-and-director bar.  Separately, the Court of Appeals issued an order granting Specialty the right to a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 5(b).  The SEC's investigation was conducted by James L. Isham and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Kim and Ms. Keltner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Labor and Industries, and the Office of Inspector General."
