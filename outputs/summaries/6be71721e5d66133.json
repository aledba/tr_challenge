  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a former correctional officer who was charged with misconduct in connection with a disciplinary action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Riverside County, California, alleges that Deputy Jose Quintanar violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he violated the disciplinary provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rule 206(3) and (4) thereunder. The SEC also alleges that, contrary to the Commission's findings, the hearing officer was required to exercise independent judgment regarding whether there was sufficient cause to reduce the severity of the discipline to be imposed, and whether he should sustain the discipline if it was appropriate.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Commission failed to consider whether the officer had exercised his independent judgment when determining whether to impose the appropriate discipline.  Finally, the SEC alleges that Chief Deputy Steve Thetford, who was also a hearing officer at the time of the misconduct, failed to use his independent judgement when he was required by the Commission to do so.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Commission agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the federal securities laws, ordering it to pay a civil penalty of 80 hours, and imposing an officer-and-director bar. The Commission also agreed to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $20,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2014, the court entered a judgment granting a writ of mandamus against Quint\u00e1nar, ordering him to comply with the court's order. The court also ordered him to provide a copy of the order to the SEC, which was filed on July 4, 2014.  As part of the settlement, the District Attorney's Office agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from future violations of the Exchange Act, and orders it to conduct a full-scale evidentiary hearing to determine whether there is sufficient cause for the officer to impose discipline. The hearing officer will then be required to submit a written opinion to the court on whether it is reasonable to impose a discipline and determine whether he has exercised independent judgment. The Division of Enforcement also agreed with the Commission that, in its opinion, the appropriate disciplinary discipline should be determined by the court at a later date. The Court also agreed that, based on the evidence presented, the disciplinary disciplinary matrix should be reviewed independently."
