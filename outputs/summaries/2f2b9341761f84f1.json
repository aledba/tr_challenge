  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin today entered a final judgment against a Wisconsin-based manufacturer and its distributor in a related action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison, Wis., alleges that, in 2015, Trokamed GmbH and Blue Endo Mach., Ltd., a German manufacturer that manufactures and sells its morcellators in Wisconsin, violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose that the manufacturer was not state-based.  According to the complaint, the manufacturer did not have sufficient contacts with the federal government to exercise jurisdiction over the company.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2014, after a 2014 injury and a 2015 morcellator sale in Wisconsin that resulted in Morgan's injury, the company was not permitted to sell its products in the United States.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.  On May 31, 2018, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against the defendants and ordered them to comply with the court's order.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 564 (Feb. 26, 2018).  The court also granted a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered the company to provide a copy of the complaint to the court for further examination.    In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company, alleging that it violated the anti-fraud provision of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Securities Act Rule 206(3) and (4) thereunder. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter in the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wisconsin Department of Commerce, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, the Minnesota Department of Insurance, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services."
