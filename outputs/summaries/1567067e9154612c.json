  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Tallahassee-based prison company Trans Am Worldwide and Florida Department of Corrections' (FDC) motion to transfer venue for a pending criminal case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 30, 2018, filed in federal district court in the Middle district of Florida, Defendants violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC alleges that defendants violated the anti-fraud provision of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against defendants in connection with the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  On May 2, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Defendants, charging them with violations of Section 13(b)(5) and 13(a)(3) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Defendants' violations of Sections 14(e)(1) and 15(a) and (3) thereunder of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and penny stock bars against Defendants.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13, 2018 WL 3090394, No. 4:17cv-1171 (N.D. Fla. Apr. 22, 2009).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant certain of the defendants who are currently in prison for their alleged violations of the same policies and practices promulgated and enforced by Defendants. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Rickey L. Newberg and supervised by Graham Loomis. The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of International Affairs, the U.N. Office of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
