  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Pepper Hamilton LLP and its individual attorneys in an ongoing civil litigation action.  According to the court's order, filed on June 26, 2017, Pepper Hamilton improperly accessed documents and filed a complaint on behalf of its litigation counsel.  The court found that the disqualification order violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court had the power to impose an automatic stay of all trial court proceedings.  In addition, the court ruled that an order granting an attorney disqualification was a mandatory injunction and that it should be followed by an enforcement order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later time.  On August 4, 2018, a federal district court in San Francisco issued an order suspending Pepper Hamilton from appearing in court proceedings pending a judgment that requires him to be permanently enjoined from violating the securities laws and ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains and pay a civil penalty of $1.2 million.  A hearing on August 5, 2018 was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The court granted the motion for a temporary restraining order and an order requiring Pepper Hamilton to comply with the judgment. The SEC's order temporarily suspended Pepper Hamilton's participation in the litigation pending a determination of whether to proceed with an injunction or to issue an order appointing a receiver.  An SEC order suspending the appointment of a receiver would require the court to determine whether to grant or deny an attorney's motion for an emergency stay of proceedings, which would require a court to consider the merits of the matter at the time the order was issued.  Additionally, the SEC's complaint alleges that Pepper Hamilton violated Section 916 of the Exchange Act by improperly accessing documents and filing a complaint with the SEC.  It also alleges that, in the course of the litigation, he violated Sections 917(a) and (c) and 916(b)(5) the reporting provisions of Sections 918(a)(2) and 17(c) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, an order freezing the assets of certain defendants, and a court order requiring the issuance of an order permanently enjoining the defendants from violating Section 9"
