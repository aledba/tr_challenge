  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Bloomberg Finance L.P., a New York City-based financial services company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, Bloomberg uses proprietary methods and processes to aggregate, organize, and curate market and reference data for over fifty million financial instruments across a range of asset classes.  The complaint alleges that UBS, in violation of the Exchange Act, provided for the safe-harbor provision in Section 5 of the exchange agreement, and that, in exchange for access to the data, UBS would be required to provide for the dissemination or distribution of the data.  In addition, the SEC alleges that, contrary to UBS's representations, Bloomberg is permitted to download the entire universe of Bloomberg reference data from UBS Delta, regardless of whether those clients had Bloomberg data licenses.  UBS has also agreed to pay an annual fee of $300,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Bloomberg has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,500.  On August 13, 2018, the court granted a request for a temporary restraining order against UBS from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered UBS to comply with the court's order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the New York office by Michael J. Birkenheier and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, the U.K. Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services."
