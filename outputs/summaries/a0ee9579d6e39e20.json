  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the California Department of Labor against Bloomingdale's, Inc. (\"Bloomingdale\").  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that, in September 2003, the state of California passed a law requiring employees to submit written notice of an alleged Labor Code violation to the agency.  The complaint also alleges that the federal district court for the Northern District of California issued a temporary restraining order preventing the filing of a PAGA action without the state's consent.  According to the complaint, the court found that, contrary to the federal law, an employee's right to a representative action waiver is nonwaivable under state law.  In addition, the complaint alleges that an employee may bring a civil action for unpaid wages and statutory penalties without the agency agreeing to arbitrate the matter.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Los Angeles Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Secretary of State's Office, and the California Attorney General's Office in this matter."
