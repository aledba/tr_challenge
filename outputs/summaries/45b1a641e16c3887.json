  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Alphonso Waters, Jr., a former CEO of Family Practice of Atlanta, a medical practice he owned and operated with his wife, Dr. Sondi Moore-Waters, a physician.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Waters sought a loan from a private equity firm for a $6 million loan in 2013. The complaint alleges that Waters told the firm that he was going to use the loan to repay several years\u2019 worth of federal tax liens, and that the loan was worth $2.4 million more than the amount of the loan. But, according to the complaint, the firm did not consider the loan a \"deal killer\" because it did not involve any actual harm to the borrower. Instead, the complaint alleges, Waters lied about the nature of the deal, and the firm failed to show that the liens were material to the loan transaction.  The complaint further alleges that, as a result of the district court\u2019s refusal to grant Waters\u2019 motion for a judgment of acquittal, Waters was sentenced to six months in prison and one year of supervised release.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Waters consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $20,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Waters.
