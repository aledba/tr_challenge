  "summary": "On November 14, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington entered a final judgment against Matthew and Amy Johnson, who claimed that they were entitled to an exclusive easement in Lake Cushman, Washington for park and road purposes.  The court found that the Johnsons violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to provide sufficient evidence to support their claim that the easement was void.  According to the court's order, Matthew Johnson and Mark Schomaker filed a motion to summary judgment in favor of summary judgment against LCMC on their behalf, alleging that LCMC violated Section 13(b)(5) and 13(a)(3) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Matthew Johnson.  On June 23, 2015, a federal district court in Tacoma, Washington, entered a judgment granting summary judgment to Matthew and Adams, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000, and ordering the sale of all of the property to LCMC.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court granted summary judgment, ordered Matthew and Andrew Johnson to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains, and ordered Adams to pay civil penalties of $2,500, $500, and $100,000.  Adams agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The court also granted Adams a temporary restraining order, barring him from appearing before the SEC as an attorney, and from participating in the issuance of any federal securities law. The order also prohibits him from associating with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott Frost and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Frost and Mr. Werner. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General."
