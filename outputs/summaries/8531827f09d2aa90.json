  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment in favor of finding that the registration requirements for sex offenders violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that the mandatory registration requirements imposed on sex offenders are not punitive because they do not impose a penalty on the offender. Rather, the complaint alleges, as alleged in the complaint, the registration and notification requirements are designed to prevent potential recidivists from relapsing into sexually violent offenses. The complaint further alleges that, in Muniz, for example, the mandatory reporting requirements for SVPs were so severe that they required the SVP to be incarcerated for a minimum of 100 times over the course of a five-year period.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Muniz agreed to the court's order, which permanently enjoins the SEC from imposing any additional registration or notification requirements, and orders the SEC to conduct an independent review of the relevant provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Apprendi and Alleyne for their roles in the alleged scheme.  According to the complaint filed in the federal district court for the Eastern District of Michigan, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of Section 9799.24(e)(3). The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 24, 2019)."
