  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted on four drug-related charges.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least February 2017 through March 2018, a law enforcement officer named Donald T. Duran solicited the purchase of crack cocaine from a suspected drug dealer, telling him that he would use the drug to make crack cocaine.  According to the complaint, Duran agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to an order permanently enjoining him from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordering him to disgorge $10 million in prejudgment interests, pay $5,000 in civil penalties, and pay a $20,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Duran.  On March 8, 2017, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered the asset freeze to be temporarily halted pending the outcome of the criminal case.  A hearing scheduled for April 5, 2018, was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. Eastern time. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, the FBI, and the New Jersey Department of Criminal Justice.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-cv-01-17 (January 10, 2019)."
