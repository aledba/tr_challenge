  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment in favor of a British citizen charged with defrauding a Washington, D.C.-based private equity firm by making false and misleading statements about his contacts with government agencies.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that William Browder, who renounced his British citizenship in 1998, made numerous media appearances in the District to promote his book, The Magnitsky Act.  According to the complaint, in 2008, Russian prison guards detained an auditor for Hermitage Capital Management, Inc., who, in 2009, died in a Russian prison.  Mr. Browder allegedly told the SEC that he was a \"Russian GRU officer, intelligence asset, or spy for the Russian Federation or former Soviet Union.\"  The complaint further alleges that Browder's frequent media appearances were related to his testimony before the United States Helsinki Commission, when he discovered that Russian government officials and members of organized crime had perpetrated a tax fraud scheme using the identities of several Hermitages portfolio companies.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in one of those media appearances, Browder claimed that he had been labeled as a \"spy\" by the government and had \"no good faith basis\" for stating those falsehoods.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the court has agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins Browder from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-3 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, and to pay a civil penalty of $1,500.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Browder.  Among other things, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, as well as an officer-and-director bar.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-423 (D.D.C. 2010). "
