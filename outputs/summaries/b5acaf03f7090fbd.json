  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Weyerhaeuser Company, Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based company that provides coating services.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, Washington, alleges that, from at least December 2016 through June 2017, Boudreaux was exposed to formaldehyde while performing work on the job repairing an electric motor.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that the company violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose that it had no jurisdiction over claims arising from on-the-job injuries.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants failed to disclose to the superior court that the defendants were not entitled to the same right of action as their statutory employer.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that Weyerhmeeuser violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rules 206(3) and 206 (4) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains the jurisdiction of the federal court for the purposes of determining whether the defendants are entitled to certain remedies under the Exchange Act. The Defendants also agreed to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Finally, the Court granted the Defendants\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of service. The Court also granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval. The defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the parties. The settlements are subject to Court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 22, 2018).  The Complaint also names as a defendant a defendant in a civil action brought by the Defendants against the Defendants, against whom it is alleged that the Defendants violated Sections 206 and 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers to the Advisers\").  The complaint also names the defendants as relief defendants."
