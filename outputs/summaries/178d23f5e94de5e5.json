  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered an equitable distribution order against Husband and Wife, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Husband violated Section 3502 of the Divorce Code by failing to account for the fact that he had been out of the workforce for over two years and had failed to pay the court-ordered child and spousal support.  According to the complaint, Husband also failed to disclose to the court that he was unemployed for a significant period of time and that he used the proceeds from the liquidation of the retirement accounts to meet his support obligations.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court failed to consider the financial impact of Husband's decision to liquidate the accounts, which he claimed was voluntary and a result of his dire economic circumstances in 2014 and 2015.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,897 per month for four years and $156,941.74 in child support and an attorney's fee for a six-month period.  Husband has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay a civil penalty of $2,192, which is equal to the amount owed to him by the company in the complaint.  On June 26, 2018, the court granted Husband a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return the allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, to be distributed among the parties, and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  As set forth, the settlement is subject to court approval, and the parties will be required to comply with the court's order.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018.  Separately, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  A hearing scheduled for May 24, 2019, is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Brubaker and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office, with assistance from John R. Rymas of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and the Office of Compliance and Risk Assessments."
