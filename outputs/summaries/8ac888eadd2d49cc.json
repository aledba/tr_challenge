  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against a former member of the school board who claimed that he could not challenge the eligibility of a candidate for the district's school board.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis on August 24, 2018, Donald B. Kite, Sr. of Indianapolis, Indiana, falsely claimed that Alexandra Curlin was eligible to run for the District 2 school board seat.  The complaint alleges that Curlin filed her CAN-34 with the Indiana Secretary of State's Office shortly before the November 6, 2018 election, and that Kite followed through on his claims by filing a verified petition to contest the election on August 23, 2018.  Curlin, however, did not reside in District 2 and instead sought to determine whether she was eligible and qualified to hold the office.  Kite also allegedly failed to check the background of Curlin's opponent, Bill Turner of Indiana, who filed a similar complaint in the same district the day after the election.  In a parallel action, the Indiana Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Curlin arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Curlin consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against her from serving as an officer or director of a public school district for five years.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Education's Office of Public Finance and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Amy C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Indiana Department of Education and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
