  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against Kent Vu Phan, a Colorado resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Denver on June 19, 2018, Phan is barred by the federal securities laws from representing himself in fee-generating cases.  The complaint alleges that Phan has failed to adequately allege that he was discriminated against based on his race or disability.  For example, the SEC previously dismissed Phan\u2019s claims of medical malpractice, legal malpractice and bad faith insurance practices against Health First Colorado/Medicaid based on Eleventh Amendment immunity.  Phan also alleges that his attorney conspired and retaliated against him because he was a qualified individual with a disability, and because his attorney had the intent to discriminate on the basis of race.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Colorado today announced criminal charges against Phan arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.   The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Finally, the court issued an order suspending Phan from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On June 20, 2019, the Honorable Paul G. Hall of Justice granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Phan to comply with the court's order. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David A. Hampton, Kelly L. Gibson, John R. Rymas, and Patrick J. McCluskey of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Hampton and Ms. Gibson and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado Office of Insurance Regulation."
