  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the city of Palmdale, California, charging a former city employee with defacing graffiti on city property.  The court's order, which was entered on consent, permanently enjoins the city from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 594 of the federal securities laws, and orders the city to pay a civil penalty of $500,000.  In a parallel action, the court also issued a temporary restraining order against Ruth Oschmann, a city employee who helped prepare an analysis of the average cost to clean up graffiti in the city.  According to the order, the city's methodology for calculating the average costs was flawed, as it did not include the costs of law enforcement, which is not a proper consideration in assessing the damage caused by the graffiti.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's judgment, Oschman consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the anti-fascism provisions of Sections 594 and 594, and ordering her to serve 37 days in juvenile hall. The court also permanently enjoined her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security or other security measure, including the right to reapply after five years in prison.  It also ordered the city attorney to appoint a receiver to determine the amount of restitution owed to the city, county, or state.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 594-17.  Separately, the Court granted the City Attorney's Office's request for an asset freeze and a temporary asset freeze.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans issued an order appointing a receiver for the city and county that would determine the appropriate restitution amount for each of the graffiti removal and damage recovery programs. The receiver will determine the restitution amount at a later date.  A hearing will be held on May 26, 2018.
