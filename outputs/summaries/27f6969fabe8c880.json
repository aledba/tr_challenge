The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that, in August 2015, QuiTam filed a complaint under seal and served the SEC with a copy of the Complaint.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to take into account the facts and circumstances presented to them in their complaint, and instead relied on the false and misleading claims in the complaint to justify their action.  Qui tam also alleges that QuiT failed to consider the fact that the complaint had been publicly disclosed in news articles and in a publicly disseminated governmental report at the time the complaint was filed, and failed to recognize that the Defendants had engaged in a scheme to defraud the County.

The court granted the defendants\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against them, and ordered a hearing on May 26, 2018.  A hearing is scheduled for June 5, 2018 to determine whether to proceed with the litigation.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-9 (D).
