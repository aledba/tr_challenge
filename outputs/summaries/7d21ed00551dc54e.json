  "summary": "On July 1, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Will County Sheriff's Deputy Thomas Hannon, Jr., who was charged with unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon stemming from a traffic stop in May 2013.  According to the SEC's complaint, Hannon was on patrol and parked his marked squad car when he observed a car approach the intersection at Chicago Street and Zarley Boulevard.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of the traffic stop, defendant appeared nervous, shaking, and sweating.  Hannon allegedly told the car's driver that he had a gun in the glove compartment and that he did not know the length of his sentence.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the defendant had a prior felony conviction for murder in 1990, and he completed his prison sentence for the same felony in 1998.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's judgment, the SEC alleges that Hannon violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hannon.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael O'Halloran and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, the Illinois Department of Insurance, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the FBI's Criminal Investigations Division, the Department of Justice's Asset Management Fraud Task Force, the Criminal Division's Office of Inspector General, the Office of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit and the Illinois Division of Securities and Exchange Commission. The litigation will be led by Mr. Domagala. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages the public to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
