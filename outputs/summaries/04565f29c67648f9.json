  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Sulphur Pediatric Clinic, Inc. d/b/a The Pediatric Center of Southwest Louisiana (Center) and its owner, Dr. Albert Richert, Jr.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay $258,569.00 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In addition, the court also ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, which is less than 20% of the amount requested by the SEC.  On August 10, 2010, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in New Orleans, alleging that Dr. Rodgers breached the standard of care and that, consequently, Anthony lost a chance of survival.  According to the complaint, in the absence of evidence suggesting that any reduction in the risk of Anthony's survival was significant, the complaint alleges that the defendant carried a burden of showing the value of that lost chance of surviving when he had a chance to lose it, when in fact he had lost it because of medical malpractice.   The SEC's Complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges the defendants with violating the anti-fraud provision of the Exchange Act, Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against the defendants.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-1488 (Aug. 26, 2010).  The Complaint also seeks a judgment ordering the destruction of any evidence that may have contributed to the loss of a life-threatening tumor. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
