  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico today entered a final judgment against United Parcel Service (UPS) for its failure to timely deliver thyroid medication to an Eutawville, South Carolina, address.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Puerto Rico, on April 11, 2013, Cortland James Eggleston received treatment for his thyroid condition from the Veterans Administration (VA) hospital in Charleston. On numerous occasions in the past, UPS delivered shipments of thyroid medication from the VA hospital to his rural home, but the medication failed to arrive. The complaint alleges that UPS failed to timely timely deliver the medication because a correct street name was needed for the address. In addition, the complaint alleged that UPS was negligent in failing to properly and accurately locate Appellants' medical records, in failing properly to maintain proper policies and procedures for delivering packages, and in failed to properly hire, train, and supervise personnel at the local pharmacy.  The complaint charges UPS with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against UPS. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kelly L. Gibson, John Rymas, and Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Graham Loomis and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
