  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Arkansas today announced criminal charges against a former administrative specialist at the University of Central Arkansas for her role in a long-running back pain.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Little Rock, Arkansas, alleges that, on May 5, 2017, Elizabeth Elizabeth Srite was injured while lifting a box and fell to the floor with it.  According to the complaint, Srite told her family doctor that she was suffering from back pain and had been taking pain medication from 2007 through 2017.  She also allegedly had back problems that lasted this long and involved her left leg.  Srite also allegedly suffered from kidney stones, which she thought had been caused by a work-related injury.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Srite had suffered from acute worsening of a chronic disc injury, which caused her to be taken off work in 2004 and to be sent to the ER in 2017 with abdominal pain and pain in her right leg after a drive to Arizona in July 2012.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Srite from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Srite to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer and director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018."
