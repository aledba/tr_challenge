  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against defendant Raiquan Turner, Jr., who was found liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Virginia Beach, Virginia, alleges that Turner, a Virginia resident, and two other individuals entered the Cheetah Lounge on January 6, 2019, intending to rob a member of the public. The complaint alleges that the defendants entered the club with the intention of making multiple identifications and identifying the same person on multiple occasions, and Turner and his accomplice, Timothy Watson, entered and sat at a table to the left of the club. Watson and Watson then allegedly attempted to convince the jury that they were mistaken for each other. The SEC alleges that, contrary to these representations, Turner and Watson failed to show any evidence that they had been mistaken for the perpetrator, and that the jury ultimately elected not to do so because they were not satisfied with the jury\u2019s finding.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Virginia today announced criminal charges against Turner, Watson, Mitchell, and Phillips for their roles in the alleged scheme.  According to the SEC's Complaint, the Court of Appeals previously issued an order requiring a jury instruction on eyewitness identification to be followed by an examination of the evidence. The Court also issued a temporary restraining order, which temporarily enjoins Turner from participating in any future jury selection, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Turner has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Turner has also agreed to a settlement that includes a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar. The court will determine the amount of disgorgement and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  A hearing on the matter is scheduled for May 11, 2019.  On May 13, 2020, the SEC issued a preliminary injunction against Turner and Mitchell, ordering them to return their allegedly forged ID cards to the jury, and ordering Turner to surrender his passport.  Watson and Mitchell agreed to settle the case by consenting to entry of the final judgment that prohibits them from violating the charged provisions of federal law and orders them to pay civil penalties of $50,000 and $100,000, respectively."
