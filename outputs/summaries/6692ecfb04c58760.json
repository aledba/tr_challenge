  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Pheerayuth Burden, a Thai national who ran a business exporting goods from the United States to Thailand, and his company, Wing-On LLC, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Burden and ordered him to return to Thailand.  According to the court's order, Burden consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunctive relief.  In its order, the court also ordered Burden to comply with a court order requiring him to show cause and effect, including that he had read, was aware of, or had consulted the relevant licensing provisions of the relevant federal laws, and that he was not liable for his actions.  Burden agreed to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, and agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty. The court granted the SEC\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations, and ordered that Burden comply with the court order.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the U. S. District Judge in Manhattan entered a judgment ordering him to permanently enjoin Burden from violating these provisions, and ordering that he pay a penalty of up to five years. The order also ordered that he comply with an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, which would determine whether Burden is liable for future violations.  A hearing on May 26, 2018 will be held to consider the merits of the case.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 24, 2019).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United Kingdom Attorney General's Office for the Northern District of California, and the United State Secret Service in this matter."
