  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was sentenced to 55 years in prison for the August 2009 murder of a Decatur, Illinois man.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on August 24, 2009, a group of teenage males confronted Jerry Newingham and Kevin Wilson in the parking lot of MacArthur High School in Decatur. According to the complaint, Newingham was confronted by the defendants and kicked and stomped on the head of Wilson, who was lying on the ground and unable to walk or answer questions. The complaint further alleges that the defendants made an inculpatory statement at the time of the attack, which was not presented to the jury. The court found Newingham guilty of the charges and sentenced him to a de facto life sentence without the possibility of parole. The SEC also found that Branden White violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. The Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against White, and a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any security deposit, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Newingham. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, Patrick J. McCluskey, and Amy C. Welshhans of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Wyshans. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
