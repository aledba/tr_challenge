  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a former county board of education for failing to provide a sound basic education.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that, in violation of Section 15(a) of the North Carolina state constitutions, the Board of County Commissioners (BCC) has the right to determine whether to grant funding to local school districts.  According to the complaint, as a result of inadequate funding from the state, the boards of county commissioners have had to resort to hiring teachers with little or no experience, and failing to adequately allocate funds to school buildings and facilities.  In addition, the complaint alleges that county boards of commissioners have been disproportionately burdened by inadequate funding for education, with more than half of the school district's students suspended or expelled due to inadequate funding.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their civil penalties.  On May 2, 2018, the United States District Court in Charlotte entered a judgment against the defendants, finding that the District of Columbia violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the district attorney to issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the district's allocation of school funds.   The court's order also ordered the county commissioners to provide for and maintain the school building and other basic education facilities at their respective locations.  As part of the settlement, the court granted the defendants a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from violating the federal laws, and ordered them to comply with the court's orders. \u00c2\u00a0The court also issued an order requiring the county school board to provide financial assistance to the district.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (January 17, 2018).  The Court also issued a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, ordering the county to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and imposing a $100,000 officer and director bar.  Finally, the Court granted the District Attorney's Office's request for an asset freeze and an accounting of the funds that were lost in the alleged violations.
