  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against a former Fayette County Sheriff who was charged with obstructing justice.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on June 22, 2016, Deputy Bob Fritcher of Fayette, Illinois, provided false information to an officer who observed the defendant throwing a crack pipe over a fence while he was fleeing from officers. The complaint further alleges that the officer confronted the defendant and told him that he could not read the license plate because it was covered in dirt and therefore illegible. The officer arrested the defendant immediately after he gave the false name and date of birth to the officer. The court found that the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay a $100 public defender reimbursement fee. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to repay the officer's ill-gotten gains with interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Fritchers. The SEC also announced related criminal charges related to his obstruction of justice conviction.  On August 16, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the defendant to surrender his passport, which he did not have, and the officer to pay the $100,000 civil penalty. The judge granted the request for a temporary restraining order and issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Chicago Police Department, the FBI, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Missouri Department of Justice, the Federal Housing Finance Corporation, the State Department of Banking and Securities, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Ohio Department of Insurance, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov."
