  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Mark James Madden and his wife, Judy Ann Madden, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Mark and Judy Madden violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the court found that, in 2012, when Mark sought to terminate or reduce his spousal maintenance obligation after his income declined due to health problems, he failed to provide reasonable efforts to increase his or her earning capacity. The complaint further alleges that, shortly before the dissolution of the marriage, Judy filed a motion to modify the award of permanent maintenance based on its finding that she was unable to provide for her reasonable needs and that she had failed to fulfill her obligations as a result of the dissolution.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the federal securities laws, ordering Mark to pay $10,000 in conduct-based attorney fees, and ordering Judy to comply with the court's order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Mark.  On November 15, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the New York District Court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Mark from participating in any future settlement of a civil action brought by the court against him. The judgment also prohibits Mark from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in the securities of any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The court also barred Mark from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $1,500,000, which is equal to the amount of his compensation. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.K. Attorney's Secret Service."
