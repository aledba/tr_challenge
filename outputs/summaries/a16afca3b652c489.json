  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Hawai'i today entered a final judgment against a company that allegedly discriminated against an employee who suffered a work-related injury.  According to the court's order, on September 15, 2010, Tammy L. Josue filed a complaint with the Wage Standards Division of the Department of Labor and Industrial Relations alleging that BCI Coca-Cola Bottling Company (Coca-Cola) discriminated against her solely because of her work injury. The complaint alleges that, after Josue's injury, the company offered her the position of temporary supervisor, which she held until she was medically cleared to return to work. However, according to the complaint, this position was vacant for ten months, and the company refused to fill it with a permanent employee until Josue returned.  The complaint further alleges that the company's failure to fill the position resulted in a business impairment for the company.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the Commission concluded that the employer violated Section 378-32(2) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The Commission also found that, contrary to the Commission's findings, the employer failed to meet its burden to prove that it had a legitimate reason for not retaining Josue as a temporary supervisor.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company for its role in this matter. The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation was conducted by Scott F. McCole and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Graham Loomis and Ms. Gibson."
