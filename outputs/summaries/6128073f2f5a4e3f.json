  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of second-degree murder and attempted premeditated murder.  The court entered the final judgment in People v. Navarrete (2017) 5 Cal.4th at p.\u00c2\u00a0253. The court found that, in the course of its deliberation, the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court found the defendant liable for second- and attempted-medicine murder based on his or her participation in a criminal street gang.  According to the court's order, the defendants were also liable for third- and fourth-degree murders.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court of Appeal issued an order suspending the suspension of the defendants from appearing or practicing before the court as part of an equal protection proceeding.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Sansone and Sansone consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties.  Sansone also agreed to be enjoined from participating in any future solicitation of the purchase, sale, offer, or promotion of any firearm, other than for his own personal use, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The final judgment permanently enjoins Sansone from violating the charged provisions and orders Sansone to pay a civil penalty of $7.6 million. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised in the Office of the Chief of the Division of Criminal Justice. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.
