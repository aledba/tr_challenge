  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc., a Utah-based medical device manufacturer, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that, from at least March 2000 through March 2010, Dr. Braun raised the issue of whether to pay a $2.5 million civil penalty to settle the SEC's charges against him.  According to the complaint, the jury found that, contrary to what the SEC alleges, Braun failed to show that he and the company had a reasonable and reasonable understanding of the risks of his invention and that he had a duty to mitigate under the contract as early as 2002.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Braun consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Utah today announced criminal charges against Braun.  On May 24, 2014, the U. S. District Judge for the Southern District of New York granted the SEC and the Utah Attorney General's Office a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering a preliminary injunction against further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") as well as an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue a civil injunctive relief order against Braun, ordering a hearing on the matter, ordering an injunction, and imposing an officer-and-director bar against all defendants in the case.  A hearing is scheduled for May 26, 2014.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (Feb. 21, 2014).  The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa, Chief of the Salt Lake Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
