  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against John M. Muller, a former member and Membership Secretary of the Northern Chester County Sportsman's Club, for failing to comply with the club's 2014 bylaws.  The court also entered an order suspending Muller from serving as a member or officer of the club.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, Muller was suspended from participating in the Club's 2014 membership by the Board of Directors without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Muller.  Muller has agreed to settle the charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the bylaws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000.  On May 24, 2016, the court granted Muller's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return all of his membership records, including those that he had received from the Club, to the Club.  As alleged in the court's order, Muller also agreed to be permanently enjoined from contacting Club members, to be barred from contacting members, and to be expelled from the club as a result of the Board's suspension of him.   The SEC's order also prohibits Muller from associating with any non-profit organization with which he has a prior conviction for a felony, and from participating as an officer or director of a public sporting event.  It also requires Muller to provide a copy of the Club membership records to the Board, which is required by the organization's bylaws, including membership dues and assessments, and that he must provide proof of membership by submitting a membership renewal form to the board.  For example, Muller provided the Club with a DVD containing copies of Club membership, but did not return the membership records.  He also provided the club with a letter informing members that he was not permitted to return the club membership records after a 30-day written notice of a delinquency.  Without admitting to these violations, Muller has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5 and 17a-1 thereunder, and ordering him to reimburse the Club for his alleged violations of Section 5(b).  The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about membership suspension, see membership suspension and disciplinary actions, see Membership Suspension Bulletin"
