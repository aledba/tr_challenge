  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama today entered a final judgment in favor of a former materials manager at a state manufacturing facility who has agreed to be permanently barred from receiving unemployment benefits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Alabama, alleges that, in 2012, Keith Michael Arnold was hired by Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, LLC (HMMA), a sister company of HMMA, as a manager in its production-control department. According to the complaint, Arnold signed an agreement obligating him to reimburse HMMA for all collection costs, attorney fees, and expenses related to his relocation from Kentucky to Alabama. The agreement also obligated Arnold to pay HMMA an additional $11,710 for prejudgment interest and $20,293 for attorney fees and expenses. The complaint further alleges that Arnold refused to comply with HMMA's request for a summary judgment, despite repeated requests from HMMA to do so. The court ultimately granted the SEC's motion for a judgment against HMMA.  In its judgment, the court found that Arnold was liable for breach of contract and granted HMMA $67,534 in damages.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, however, Arnold consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $99,537, an amount that fully compensates HMMA under the reimbursement agreement.  On July 18, 2018, the trial court entered a judgment granting the SEC and HMMA summary judgments against Arnold and against each of them. The judgment also ordered HMMA and the other defendants to pay disgorgement of $1,078, which is equal to the amount of their compensation, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-11, 206 (Ala. 1987).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Alabama Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
