  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota yesterday entered a final judgment against a Minnesota insurance company for failing to enforce a federal law that prohibits insurance companies from subrogating an insured.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnesota, alleges that Craig Dollansky signed a rental agreement with Karavan Trailers, Inc., a company owned by Karavan, in Nebraska. According to the complaint, Dollansky had obtained an extension of his personal-vehicle insurance policy, as required by the policy, and had obtained a claim for the full amount of the insured's loss. The complaint alleges that, after the fire, the RV caught fire while Dollansky was driving it, and the RV sustained significant damage. The SEC alleges that Dollansky's insurance policy provided that he was liable for all damages to the RV during the term of the agreement, regardless of the cause of the loss.  In a parallel action, the Minnesota Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against Dollansky, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay $204,895.05 in disgorgement, $4,500 in prejudgment interest, and $500 in civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay a civil penalty, and appoint a receiver. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Minnesota Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Minnesota Office of Insurance Regulation."
