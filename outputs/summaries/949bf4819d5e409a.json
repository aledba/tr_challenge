  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against Greene County and the City of Union Point, Georgia, that permanently enjoins the county from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay civil penalties in the form of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that the trial court improperly directed or enjoined the County from providing emergency dispatch services, funding animal control, building inspection, and planning and zoning services with county revenues from the incorporated areas of the county.  In its order, the court found that the County violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the court exceeded its authority to impose civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the County consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating these provisions, ordering the County to pay a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $10,000, and ordering the City to refund certain taxes collected if no agreement was reached.  According to the SEC's order, in a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the County.
