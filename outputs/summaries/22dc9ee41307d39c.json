  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the County of San Diego for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 830 of the Securities Act of 1933.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that the County violated the federal design immunity provision of the federal securities laws by failing to establish the discretionary approval element of a design immunity defense.  According to the complaint, the County failed to establish that a licensed civil and traffic engineer had the discretionary authority to determine whether a design was reasonable.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to the County's representations, the county failed to demonstrate that the design had a reasonable basis for being reasonable and that a reasonable public official could have approved the design before it was implemented.  As a result, the defendants were unable to show any evidence of the reasonableness of the design, and the County was unable to determine that there was any reasonable basis to impose a penalty on the defendants.  Finally, the court found that the defendants had failed to show sufficient evidence to show that the District Attorney's Office had reasonable cause to issue an order requiring the defendants to show cause of action, including cause of death, to be satisfied by the evidence presented in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of federal law, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David R. Higgins and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the San Diego Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Higgins, Ms. Werner, and Mr. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the California Department of Transportation in this matter."
