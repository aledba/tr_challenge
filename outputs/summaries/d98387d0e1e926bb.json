  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of two counts of first-degree aggravated sexual assault and one count of third-degree felony aggravated kidnapping.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that, at a party at a friend's house, Robert K. Barela entered a jury instruction that required the defendant to \"seek out\" the evidence collected from the victim's cell phone. According to the complaint, however, the jury did not find any evidence of non-consent. Rather, the complaint alleges that the defendant entered his phone number into the safe just before the rape and then began to rape the victim. The complaint further alleges that after the rape, the defendant allegedly entered his cell phone and began to kiss the victim, telling her that he was \"weird and creepy\" and that he \"was nice after that.\" The complaint also alleges that when confronted by a member of the jury, Newton allegedly replied, \"I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I'm going to believe you.\"  The court also denied the SEC's motion for a new trial, which was filed on the same day.  In its order, the court granted Newton's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered a search of the defendant's phone, and ordered a forensic examination of the phone. The court ruled that the jury could not determine whether the defendant was liable for ineffective assistance of counsel because the jury was not law-trained, and the defendant had no reasonable expectation of a fair trial.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Newton consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Salt Lake Police Department, the Utah State Corporation Commission, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Utah Department of Health and Human Services (DOHSA) in this matter."
