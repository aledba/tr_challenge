  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against a defendant who pled guilty to making terroristic threats in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that Najee Oliver, a resident of Savannah, Georgia, made a series of false and misleading statements to a federal jury in connection with his prior felony convictions.  According to the complaint, Oliver was convicted on three felony counts: possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon, a felony with a prior felony conviction, and a terroristic-threats conviction.  Oliver was sentenced to 180 months in prison.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Georgia today announced criminal charges against Oliver arising from the same conduct alleged in Mathis v. United States, which led to the SEC's investigation of the matter.   The complaint alleges that Oliver violated the antiterrorism provisions of Sections 922(g) and 924(a)(2) and that he was liable for a 15-year minimum sentence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Oliver consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of 180 months, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service for a period of five years.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Robert E. Cleary Jr. of the Atlanta Regional Office issued an order suspending Oliver from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering him to surrender his passport.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to be restrained from associating with any third-party law violator.  Additionally, he agreed to a five-year mandatory minimum sentence and to a three-year officer-and-director bar.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 16-11-37(a).  The Commission on Securities and Exchange Commission v. Oliver, filed a complaint in federal district court in Gwinnett County, Georgia on May 9, 2018, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver. The Commission also requested a temporary restraining order prohibiting Oliver from violating any federal law, including the securities laws.
