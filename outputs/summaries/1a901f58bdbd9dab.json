  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the City of Carson and its exclusive agent in a civil action brought by the city.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Carson, Nevada, Richard Rand and his company, Rand Resources, LLC, raised the NFL's interest in Carson by promising to develop a sports and entertainment complex with the goal of acquiring an NFL team.  The complaint alleges that Rand and Rand Resources violated the antifraud provisions of Section 425 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 425.16 and 425.17 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Rand andRand Resources have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their allegedly ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, on May 26, 2015, a federal district court in Nevada entered a judgment against Rand and the defendants, finding that the defendants violated the anti-fraud provision of the Commission Act, and ordering Rand Resources to disgorge its alleged losses of $1.2 million and pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Rand Resources has also agreed to pay a $50,000 civil penalty.  To settle the Commission's charges, Rand has agreed to a permanent injunction, to be followed by an injunction, and to be barred from associating with any third party in a public proceeding. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Scott A. Kasper. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Kupel. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and Carol S. Cotter of the Chicago Regional Office. The investigation was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The trial is being conducted by David A. Cohen and supervised in the SEC Office of Public Finance by Marc Blau. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Nevada Secretary of State's Office, the FBI, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the California Department of Banking and Securities, the Arizona Department of Insurance, and other state agencies."
