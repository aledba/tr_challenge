  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against Sedgwick Properties Development Corporation (Sedgwick), a single-member, single-purpose limited liability company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that, from at least 2013 through the present, the defendants breached the corporate veil by failing to disclose to the court that they were the alter egos of 1950 Logan, and that they had no ownership or control over 1950 Logan.  According to the complaint, in addition to failing to observe the usual corporate veil, in 2013, the court found that 1950 Logan had violated the civil rights of its owner, intervenor Christopher Hinds - a disabled person who uses a wheelchair and owns a unit in the building - by selling the building's handicapped parking spaces to non-handicapped buyers, years before Hinds bought his condo unit.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of $30 million, prejudgment interest of $1.2 million, and a civil penalty of $25,000.  In a parallel action, the Colorado Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the scheme of the scheme.  On May 24, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a judgment ordering the defendants to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, imposing civil penalties, and imposing officer-and-director and penny stock bars against each of the defendants.   The complaint also seeks a court order freezing the defendants' assets and ordering them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000 each. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Denver Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
