  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Protective Life Insurance, Co. (Protective), alleging breach of contract and bad faith in handling Ivan Zochert's claims.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Protective violated its duty of good faith and fair dealing by failing to timely respond to Ivan's requests for proof of loss.  According to the complaint, on August 14, 2012, Ivan underwent a partial mastectomy and layered closure on her left breast. The following day, he was discharged from the hospital and returned to the hospital on August 31 due to complications from the procedure.  On September 2, Protective issued a final payment for Lenore's home-recovery benefit on the same day.  In its response to the Commission's order, the court found that Protective breached its duty to fair deal with Ivan and that it had a duty of reasonable care in handling his claims. The court also ruled that Protective did not fail to adequately investigate and process Ivan's claims, and that the Commission failed to do so in determining whether and when Ivan was entitled to receive benefits under the policy.   The Commission's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins Protective from violating the duty of fair dealing, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  It also orders Protective to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in the amount of $2,500.  Additionally, the Commission has ordered Protective to provide an independent review of its books and records to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support Ivan's claim.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Protective has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering it to conduct a conduct-based investigation, and ordering the Commission to conduct an independent examination of the claims process.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2017. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission has also issued a temporary restraining order against Ivan, ordering him to return to the United States and pay an $80,000 civil penalty.
