  "summary": "On June 22, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Christopher Robert Appellant, Jr., a Pennsylvania man convicted of criminal mischief and harassment, for his role in a scheme to steal a Kawasaki 600 motorcycle.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, from April 13, 2016 to April 20, 2016, Appelant claimed that he had received an additional estimate of $1,492 to repair the motorcycle parts, and that he did not touch the motorcycle. The complaint further alleges that, despite having received the additional estimate, the amount of restitution was against the discretionary aspects of the sentence.  The complaint also alleges that Mr. Korimko told the court that repairs to the motorcycle would cost an estimated $250.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the court did not consider the $2,000 restitution award as discretionary because the defendant was not a \"victim\" and could not rely on the pre-sentence investigation report in determining the amount to impose restitution.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant failed to include in his brief a statement of facts that he observed the caved-in nature of the motorcycle's parts immediately after impact.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty equal to the restitution amount he has already agreed to be imposed.  On June 24, 2018, the Court granted the SEC and its investigation, which is continuing, the request for an asset freeze, a temporary restraining order, and an officer-and-director bar in the case of a criminal mischief conviction, as well as an order appointing an independent receiver to oversee the restitution efforts of the court.   The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York State Attorney General's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17, July 17, 2017."
