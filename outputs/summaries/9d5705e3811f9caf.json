  "summary": "On January 25, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment in favor of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Phoenix, Arizona, alleges that, since September 11, 2017, the consular officer at USCIS denied Abdulrab\u2019s visa application for a qualifying relative.  According to the complaint, Abdulrab had failed to establish a legal marriage between herself and Hussein when she applied for a visa in 1993.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Abdulrab was denied multiple times for failure to prove a marital relationship with Hussein.  As alleged in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, this delay was due to a lack of sufficient evidence for a reasonable determination of whether the visa application was valid.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court order, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Additionally, the court granted the defendants a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 12(b)(5) and 13(a)(2) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 12b2-3 thereunder. The court also denied the defendants\u2019 motion for a writ of mandamus, which would have granted relief to the newly added defendants.  On February 5, 2019, a federal court in Arizona issued an order granting the defendants temporary restraining orders against future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the issuance of a final opinion, ordering an expedited hearing on the matter, and appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue a visa based on the findings of the court.  Separately, on February 13, 2019 a federal magistrate judge in Arizona granted a preliminary injunction against the addition of any additional defendants to the list of those already named in the complaint for violating the anti-fraud provision of the Exchange Act, and ordered USCIS and the other relevant agencies to comply with the requirements of Rule 12(a) and (c) thereunder of the exchange of letters of intent.  A hearing is scheduled for March 24, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 556 (January 25, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Office of International Affairs, under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone."
