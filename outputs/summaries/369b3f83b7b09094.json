  "summary": "On August 20, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Texas entered a final judgment against Texas Judge Gregory C. Pittman in a civil injunctive action brought by the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Texas, Pittman and his wife, John and Ann, raised the issue of whether another court had jurisdiction over the children.  The complaint alleges that, in 2009, a Michigan court entered an emergency custody determination that required the transfer of custody of the children from one state to another, and that the Michigan court had exclusive, continuing jurisdiction.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the Texas court did not have jurisdiction to make an initial child custody determination, and the court then improperly exercised modification jurisdiction in the child custody proceeding.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Mid-South today announced criminal charges against the father and mother.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On August 21, 2020, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws, entered an order granting them preliminary and permanent injunctions, and issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the court as part of a civil proceeding. The court also granted the mother and father a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return to Texas.   The court's order against the defendants, which is subject to court approval, requires the parties to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court, which will determine whether to grant or decline the defendants\u2019 motion for the preliminary injunction.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2019 WL 3922795, at *4. The complaint also names Texas as an appropriate venue for a hearing on the subject of the pending child custody case.

It also alleged that the Texas district court had"
