  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Kentucky woman for her role in a recent domestic violence case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Madison, Kentucky, alleges that the mother and father were involved in a long-running drug-and-alcohol relationship that resulted in the mother's inability to provide for the child's medical needs.  According to the complaint, the mother failed to produce three consecutive negative drug screens during the course of the trial.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, despite having received an emergency court order to remove the mother from the family home, she continued to withhold information about the father's history of drug use and incarceration, including that the father had been incarcerated for two counts of felony murder and three counts of robbery.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the father was not rehabilitated and had been placed in the custody of his then-wife, Y.S., who lives with and works for the paternal grandmother.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint to the SEC, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunctive relief order.  Additionally, the court granted a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered her to return to Kentucky, where she lives with her husband, T.W. who is incarcerated for federal drug possession and possession, and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  On September 11, 2018, the SEC issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering her to surrender her passport and other documents related to the alleged drug and alcohol abuse.  A hearing on September 13, 2019, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The SEC previously issued a similar order suspending her from appearing and practicing before an SEC court as well as other SEC-mandated professionals.   The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, with assistance from Joseph G. Sansone, Regional Director of the Division of Child and Family Education. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Alabama Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kentucky Department of Justice in this matter."
