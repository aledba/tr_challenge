  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of South Carolina today entered a final judgment in favor of Fred's, Inc., a Tennessee-based construction company, and Wildevco, LLC, a South Carolina-based development company, in an equitable indemnification action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Williston, South Carolina, on March 10, 2010, the court found that Fred's had a duty to protect the property of a third party and that it was liable to pay for the construction of a Fred's store.  The court also found that, contrary to the court's finding, Fred's was liable for causing the property's damages because it had experience constructing other Fred's stores.  In a parallel action, on June 6, 2016, the United States Attorney's Office for South Carolina announced criminal charges against Fred's.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that the court erred in finding Fred's liable for the building defects in the Fred's site plans and in failing to consider evidence of a similar incident at a different Fred's location.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Court also ordered Fred's to pay $305,418.30 in disgorgement, $76,691.82 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $40,000.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by James C. Gray, Jr. and Lisa D. Catt, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Gray and Ms. Cottrill. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority."
