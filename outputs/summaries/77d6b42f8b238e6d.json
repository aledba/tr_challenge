  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Dallin Mark Durbano, a Utah resident who has suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Salt Lake City on March 10, 2018, Durbanos, a law student who suffers from ADHD, initially sought an accommodation for his ADHD when he was in law school.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of his inability to obtain test accommodations, he was unable to obtain a passing score on the Bar Examination.  In a parallel action, the Utah State Bar today announced that it had issued an order requiring the Bar to consider granting an accommodation to a person with ADHD.  As set forth in the order, the Bar's order requires that an applicant who has a disability apply for an accommodation and that the Bar consider whether to grant an accommodation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the bar has agreed to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as Rule 14-706(a)(5) and 14-711(d).  The order also prohibits the Bar from denying or denying an application for a waiver of the requirements of the bar, and prohibits the bar from issuing an order imposing an injunction or requiring an officer or director to conduct an independent evaluation of an applicant.  On March 13, 2019, the court granted the bar's motion for extraordinary relief, which is subject to court approval.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Bar's Office of Inspector General, the Salt Lake Regional Office, and the Utah Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
