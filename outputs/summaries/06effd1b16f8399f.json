  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendant in a related criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, on multiple occasions between October 2012 and February 2013, the defendant and his girlfriend, Winsome Lawrence, drove a tan Jeep to Connecticut to look at a used car. According to the complaint, Lawrence told Lawrence that he was the de facto owner of the Jeep and that he had asked the driver to check the car's inspection site. The complaint further alleges that the defendant admitted to making a series of false statements during the course of his cross-examination, including one in which he claimed to have observed a \"rocket fire\" of heroin in the Jeep. The SEC alleges that this conduct violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rules 10b2-1 and (4) thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Lawrence consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The judgment also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with a criminal prosecution.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Lawrence.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans of the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendant, charging him with violating Section 15(b)(2)(A) of The Exchange Act and Rules 15b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Connecticut Department of Criminal Justice."
