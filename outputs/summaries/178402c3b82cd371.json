  "summary": "The Nebraska Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an application by Waste Connections of Nebraska, Inc. to expand its solid waste disposal landfill area in Butler County, Nebraska.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska on February 7, 2017, alleges that, on July 6, 2015, the Butler County Board of Supervisors denied BCL's request for siting approval for its landfill area.  According to the complaint, BCL filed its application on June 17, 2016, when it was told that the district court had not acquired jurisdiction over the matter and that it would not consider BCL\u2019s request.  BCL also alleged that, in the mid-1990's, it had accepted approximately 100,000 tons of solid waste per year; that by 2015, it accepted approximately 550,000 metric tons of waste, and that by 2020, it projected that it had received 800,000 to 1,500 tons per year.  In a parallel action, the Nebraska Court of Appeals today issued an order requiring the District Court to determine whether a second petition was required following the District court's June 2017, order that it held that BCL had failed to demonstrate the statutory requirements of \u00a713-1712.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's Complaint, the Board agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins BCL from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders BCL to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a civil penalty.  Finally, the court granted BCL a temporary restraining order against future violations of the federal securities laws, ordered it to comply with the court's order, and appointed a receiver to handle the matter.  On February 8, the SEC filed an emergency action against BCL, charging it with violations of Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and ordering it to pay a penalty of $1,000,000. The SEC also charged BCL with violating Section 17(a)(2)(A) of Securities Act Rule 12b-20, and Section 17 (b)(3) of\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act\u00c2\u00a013(a) and Rule 17a-1 thereunder. The court also ordered BCL not to file a new petition for review pursuant to \u00a7\u201c13(d) 13-1714, and ordered the receiver to respond within 30 days of the date of the hearing with findings of fact that the Board had not met"
