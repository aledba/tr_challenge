  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of multiple felony charges, including armed robbery, aggravated unlawful restraint, and aggravated unlawful use of a weapon.  According to the court's order, on October 22, 2014, defendant Nathan Barr was found guilty of committing an armed robbery on evidence showing that he robbed a 16-year-old Keshon Wright, who was walking with a friend in the vicinity of 7600 South Union Avenue. Barr was sentenced to 24 years' imprisonment and ordered to pay a total of $709,894 in fines, fees, and costs. The court granted Barr's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered him to return to the trial court, and issued an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue a receiver. The receiver agreed, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins Barr from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rules 206(3) and 206 (4)-8 thereunder. Barr also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The SEC's order also prohibits Barr from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, other than for his own personal use.  The court also ordered Barr to comply with the court order.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Barr arising from the same conduct that led to Barr's conviction. The complaint alleges that Barr violated Section 5 of the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (DFPR) and Rule 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On March 1, 2019, the court issued a preliminary injunction against Barr, ordering him to surrender his passport, pay a $100,000 civil penalty, and comply with a court order prohibiting him from associating with any person convicted of a felony. The order also imposed a $250,000 officer-and-director bar against Barr. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing on March 5, 2019 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.
