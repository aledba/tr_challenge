  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against a defendant who was convicted of four counts of felony sexual conduct and sentenced to prison terms ranging from 50 to 60 years.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Detroit, Michigan, alleges that, on the morning of January 29, 2018, defendant entered into a guilty plea by consent in a criminal sexual conduct case. The complaint alleges that defendant, who was a fourth-offense habitual offender at the time of the alleged assault, placed a knife in the victim\u2019s buttocks and began to masturbate. According to the complaint, the defendant then used a knife to cut off the knife and entered the closet, where the victim was standing bent over facing the ground, and placed his penis in the crease of her buttocks and ejaculated. The SEC alleges that the defendant did not violate the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the jury was properly instructed to determine whether to impose a penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against defendant.  On May 23, 2006, the court entered a final judgment against defendant that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The court granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, and ordered him to surrender his passport.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendant consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws. The final judgments also order the defendant to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $3,500, and order him to be barred from the securities industry. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing on May 24, 2013, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern. The case was being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Kurt L. Gottschall of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy S. Cotter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Criminal Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 769.12 (January 29, 2013)."
