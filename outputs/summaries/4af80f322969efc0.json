  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Feldman, finding him guilty of two counts of wire fraud and one count of money laundering.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that, in a ring of Miami nightclubs at which customers were parted from their money, Feldman and several co-conspirators engaged in a scheme to steal millions of dollars from unsuspecting customers. The complaint alleges that Feldman, who was a resident of Miami, invested in two clubs with Simchuk, Stars Lounge and VIP Diamond Club, which operated on a business model that Simchuk had developed in Eastern Europe. As alleged in the complaint, Feldman helped manage the clubs' finances through his sister, Alex Burrlader, and his business partner, Andrejs Romanov. The SEC alleges that the defendants used a variety of deceptive and underhanded tactics to increase the customers' bills and to keep them from realizing how much money they were losing. In one instance, Feldman allegedly told one of the victims that he was going to buy two bottles of champagne for the price of one but did not want to spend the money on the other. In another instance, he allegedly told the victim that he wanted to \"clean up\" the club's books and records so that he could use the money for his own benefit. In a third case, the court found Feldman guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The court also found Feldman liable for conspiracy to commit money laundering under Section 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(a)(3) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder. Feldman agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Feldman.  According to the SEC's continuing investigation, which is continuing, the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Basinger and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
