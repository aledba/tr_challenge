  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against Greyhound Lines, Inc. and its bus driver, Akos Gubica, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that the defendants failed to adequately disclose to the jury that the bus driver fell asleep at the wheel of the bus and was in danger of losing consciousness.  According to the complaint, the jury was led to believe that Greyhound could treat the truck driver as the legal standard of care and base liability solely on the fact that the driver was asleep.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in the year of the accident, Greyhound recommended that drivers use the Rule G-40 in connection with driver fatigue, and that the company was entitled to JNOV on the basis of its independent liability claim.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants also failed to disclose that they were not required to call an expert witness to testify as to the cause of the crash.  For example, the SEC alleges that when a bus driver was observed drifting in traffic lanes on a 10-mile stretch of interstate, he did not put on the brakes or take any evasive action before the impact of the impact on the bus.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the complaint filed in the federal district court for Philadelphia, the Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, impose civil penalties, and impose officer-and-director and penny stock bars.  On May 18, 2016, the trial court denied the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the court as part of a civil proceeding.   The court's order temporarily halted the Defendants' motion to reapply for a hearing on the merits of the case on June 5, 2016. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Thompson, Ms. Gibson, and Ms. Thompson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
