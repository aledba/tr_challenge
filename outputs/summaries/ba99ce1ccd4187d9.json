  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Spitzer for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, Spitzer agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from raising the issue of collateral estoppel, or whether Section 747 preempts dealer protest laws.  Spitzer also agreed to be barred from relitigating the issue in the consolidated action.  The SEC alleges that Spitzer and his companies violated Section 747 of the federal securities laws by failing to show sufficient evidence to show that Section 747 pre-empts dealers.  In a parallel action, the SEC charged Spitzer's companies with violating Section 9 of the Exchange Act, and Spitzer consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 9, and ordering Spitzer to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the court agreed to the settlement without prejudice to the parties' motion for summary judgment and to the appointment of a receiver for the receivership of the dealerships in violation of Section 747. The court also granted Spitzer the right to relitigate the preemption issue before the dealer board.  On February 2, 2017, the Court issued a temporary restraining order halting Spitzer from proceeding with the dealer protest proceeding in Michigan, Ohio, Florida, California, and Wisconsin.  It also issued an order requiring Spitzer, his companies to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to their pre-emption penalties.  Finally, on February 4, 2017 the court issued a preliminary injunction, barring Spitzer or his companies from raising or reliving the issue, barring them from participating in any future litigation.   The court's action also temporarily halted Spitzer &rsqua;s pending litigation against the dealers in Michigan and Nevada. \u00c2\u00a0On February 6, 2018, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan announced that it would conduct a parallel criminal investigation.
