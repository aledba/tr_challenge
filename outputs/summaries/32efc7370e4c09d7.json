  "summary": "On June 7, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against David Ojeda, Jr., a New York City man who was convicted of a felony for a second-degree robbery.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan on June 8, 2019, the court found that, in possession of a 9-millimeter pistol while threatening a person with whom he was having an argument, the defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 924(e)(2)(A) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  The court also ruled that, as alleged in the complaint, that the defendant was not a serious drug offender because he had previously been convicted of multiple felony drug-related crimes.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for New York today announced that it filed criminal charges against the defendant, charging him with violating the federal securities laws.  On June 9, 2019 the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a penalty equal to or greater than the amount of the penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the securities laws, and order them to pay a civil penalty of 15 years and a $75,000 civil penalty, and impose an officer-and-director bar for each of the defendants. The SEC also issued an order requiring the defendants to provide a copy of their criminal history, including a history of previous felony convictions, to be reviewed by the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 24, 2019).
