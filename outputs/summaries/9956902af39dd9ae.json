  "summary": "The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections today announced that it has obtained an order to show cause why it should not suspend or revoke a licensed esthetician's license for an indefinite period of time because of her single-count felony conviction.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on January 19, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Pennsylvania, Rosemarie Abruzzese, a registered nurse, was suspended by the Board of Professional and Occupational Affairs (BPA) on June 9, 2016, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that the Board improperly disregarded evidence not in evidence when it suspended or revoked Licensee's license.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Licensee consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins her from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $2,238, which is equal to the amount of her previous license suspension.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Licensee for her conduct in connection with the same conduct.  An SEC complaint filed in federal court in Philadelphia charges Licensee with violations of Section 5 of the BPA, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against her.  Separately, the Department of Education today announced it has suspended Licensee from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of an ongoing criminal investigation.  A hearing examiner has been appointed by the court to determine whether to impose a penalty based on the facts not in dispute, and a hearing examiner will determine the appropriate amount of monetary relief to be provided by the agency.  On August 2, 2017 the U-S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York filed criminal charges in the case.  Among other things, the SEC is seeking a temporary restraining order, an officer-and-director bar, and an injunction against future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c).  The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-20-2017."
