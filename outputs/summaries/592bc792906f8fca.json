  "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting a multi-million dollar scheme to manipulate the price of Overstock.com, Inc. shares.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, from at least 2005 through at least 2004, defendants engaged in a series of transactions that induced others to trade in the stock.  According to the complaint, the traders engaged in what the SEC described as \"naked short selling,\" in which they engaged in risky and profitable trades designed to artificially boost the stock's price.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, these transactions involved a pattern of manipulative trading, in which a clearing firm or clearing firm would \"negate\" or \"detect\" the trading and then sell the shares to the public.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the traders' actions were manipulative, as well, because they knew that the clearing firm was going to fail to deliver the shares and thus did not have the requisite liquidity to execute the trades.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of $3 million, prejudgment interest of $1.4 million, and a civil penalty of $500,000.  Finally, the court granted a temporary restraining order against the traders, freezing their assets, and barring them from associating with any broker-dealer or dealer that does not already have a registered clearing firm.  On May 17, 2013, the SEC filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York charging defendants with violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and the broker dealer registration provision of Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and a court order prohibiting the traders from engaging in manipulative trading.
