  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against a former housemate who was convicted of felony murder, arson in the first degree, concealing the death of another, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that Hajja Kenyatta Martin was the only eyewitness to the July 29, 2012, shooting death of Ralph McGhee. According to the complaint, Martin told a neighbor that, in the days before the shooting, he had borrowed a van from a family member, rented carpet installation equipment, and returned the van, smelling of deodorizer, to its owner. Martin also allegedly told the neighbor that he shot McGhee because he was angry with her because he had been unable to see his children on the day of the murder, had accused her of visiting other men and followed her as she tried to leave, and shot her numerous times at close range after a brief exchange of words. The complaint further alleges that, during cross-examination, Martin admitted to having been convicted in 1997 of theft by receiving a stolen firearm, and that he had previously been involved with his girlfriend, a long-time member of the Bloods gang, with the rank of \u201cgeneral,\u201d and had a reputation for violence. The SEC alleges that Martin violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Company Act of 1940. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of Martin\u2019s assets and liabilities. Martin agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Atlanta today announced criminal charges against Martin. In a related matter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained a court order halting an ongoing investigation into the alleged misconduct of a former officer and director of an Atlanta-based criminal organization. The investigation was conducted by Michael J. McCole and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson."
