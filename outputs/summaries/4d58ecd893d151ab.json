  "summary": "On October 13, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio entered final judgments in favor of Tree of Life Christian Schools, Inc., a private Christian school located in Upper Arlington, Ohio.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, Tree of life Christian Schools and its principal, Robert S. Welshhans, raised the issue of whether the school should be included in an office district that is not subject to the federal district court's equal terms provision.  The complaint alleges that the school violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(3) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The SEC further alleges that Tree ofLife Christian Schools failed to adequately demonstrate that it was a viable comparator for the school and failed to demonstrate that its proposed school would generate significant revenue for the city.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York today announced criminal charges against the school.  On October 16, the SEC filed an emergency action, seeking a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other emergency relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the school consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the school case, and orders the district court to determine whether to impose a preliminary injunction or order a conduct-based injunction.  Additionally, the court granted the school an emergency asset freeze and issued an order requiring the school to provide an accounting of its revenue before it can apply for the asset freeze.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a separate case, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained a court order requiring it to conduct an independent review of the federal tax laws, including the exemption provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c).  The court's order requires that the court consider the merits of the case before it imposes a permanent injunction."
