  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of first-degree child abuse.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Montgomery, Maryland, alleges that Craig Williams, who was the father of I.W., was falsely told by a trial judge that he had a \"permanent or protracted serious injury\" that could result in a new trial.  According to the complaint, however, the jury instruction did not make clear the severity of the injuries, nor did it consider whether there was a reasonable basis for the jury's finding.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the jury was told that the injury occurred during trial and that the defendant had waived his right to be present at trial in order to give the jury a chance to determine whether he had suffered a serious injury.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Williams was not harmed by this error, and the jury found him not liable.  In its judgment, the court found that Williams was liable for a second-degree felony and ordered him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC complaint, Williams consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Williams to pay disgorgement of $1,078, which is equal to his pre-judgment interest in the case.  On May 9, 2018, the Court of Special Appeals granted certiorari to the motion for new trial against Williams, finding that the trial court had improperly exercised its discretion in denying Williams's motion to be re-admitted to the jury room after deliberating for more than a year.  Williams agreed to the judgment and agreed to be permanently enjoined from further violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2) of The Securities Act.  It also agreed to pay an officer and director bar and a $10,000 civil penalty.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 4-331(a).  The Complaint also seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunction, and a penalty bar against Williams from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, offer, or promotion of any substance of any kind.  Finally, the Complaint seeks a preliminary injunction against further violations"
