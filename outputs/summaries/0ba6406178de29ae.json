  "summary": "The Honorable Tracie Brown of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that Judge Brown issued a subpoena on June 13, 2013, to compel social media providers Facebook, Inc., Instagram, LLC, and Twitter, Inc. to produce documents related to the alleged shooting of a woman and her brother.  According to the complaint, the court issued the subpoena on the same day that it issued its subpoena, and the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against the subpoena.  In its order, Judge Brown found that defendants had no viable alternative to obtaining the requested materials.  As alleged in the complaint:  The court did not consider the need for further discovery of the alleged victims' and a prosecution witness's accounts.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to produce the requested documents pursuant to the court order. The court also ordered the defendants to comply with the subpoenas without violating the federal securities laws.  On June 20, 2019, the Honorable Brown granted the request for an asset freezing order and issued an order suspending the issuance of the emergency court order and ordering the providers to produce any materials that may be relevant to the defense.  A hearing on June 21, 2019 was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and other relevant agencies in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC also issued an Investor Alert on June 12, 2018, warning investors to be wary of any solicitation of an investment that may result in a subpoena. The investor alert also warned investors not to overpay for their investment in a social media company."
