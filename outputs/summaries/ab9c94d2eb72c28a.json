  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of South Carolina today entered a final judgment against defendant Paul R. Prather in a parallel criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbia, South Carolina, alleges that Prather and Phillips violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Prather, as a special agent in the unit that performed crime scene analysis for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, falsely claimed that he was an expert in crime scene reconstruction when, in fact, he was not an expert at the crime scene.  Instead, the complaint alleges Prather told the FBI that he \"beat the shit out of [victim] with a dildo\" and that he had a phone conversation with Victim the night of the murder.  Prather also allegedly told a co-worker that the victim had been \"raped\" in the bedroom and that the dildo was carved into the small of Victim's back.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for South Carolina announced criminal charges against Prather.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Prather from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  It also orders Prather to pay disgorgement of $1,038, with prejudgment interest in the amount of $3,500, and a $100,000 civil penalty for a second time.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any security deposit or other security deposit in the name of the security deposit company or any other company that provides security deposit services to retail investors in the securities industry.  Further, the Court of Appeals has issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the background of anyone offering or selling a security deposit with respect to the identity of a person who has committed a serious felony.   The court's order also requires the FBI to provide a background check on anyone selling or offering to sell securities in the SEC, including those who are registered to sell or offer to sell security deposit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Janice Ross and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0"
