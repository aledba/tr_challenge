  "summary": "On June 6, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment in favor of the trustee in a bankruptcy proceeding against CPIF Lending, LLC, a Florida-based continuing care retirement community.  The court granted the trustee's request for an asset freeze and other emergency relief.  According to the court's order, CPIF obtained a secured claim in the amount of $9,781,224.58 based on a $9.5 million loan from Westport Holdings Tampa, LP. The court determined that the value of the secured claim was $12.9 million when the plan was confirmed, and the maximum amount of CPIF's secured claim would be the same for confirmation purposes. However, the court did not err in its valuation determination, as required by Section 1129(b)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code. Instead, it deemed the value to be \"fair and equitable\" and required CPIF to credit-bid up to the required amount of its secured claim. In a parallel action, the United States Trustee appointed a committee of Resident Creditors to represent the interests of the independent living and skilled nursing facility. The committee agreed that the bankruptcy court should have waited until the final judgment to determine whether to grant the trustee the right to credit bid in a sale of the property. The Court also agreed that there is no \"practical need\" to make a judicial determination of a secured creditor's allowed claim as of the date of confirmation. The final judgment, which is subject to court approval, ordered the trustee to pay a civil penalty of $12,9 million, or $12 million, less outstanding taxes. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Court's judgment, the trustee agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins the trustee from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The judgment also orders that the trustee be required to pay civil penalties of $1.2 million and $2 million, respectively, for each secured claim that is not satisfied by the final judgments.  In a related administrative proceeding, the Court issued an order suspending the asset freeze pending final approval by the court. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The examination that led to the discovery of the alleged violations of the anti-fraud provisions is being conducted by David A. Schiff and Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office under the supervision of John R."
