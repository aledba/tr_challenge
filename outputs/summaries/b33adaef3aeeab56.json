  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Matt L. Gibson, Jr., a Texas resident who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, alleges that, from at least September 2017 through August 2018, Matt was terminated from his parental rights because he was unable to provide for his daughter and three teenage children.  According to the complaint, Matt had been living in Cameron, Texas, since September 2017, and had not attended any counseling or parenting classes since July 2016.  Matt also allegedly had a history of substance abuse and had been previously incarcerated for burglary.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Matt had not completed his counseling and parenting classes, and that, for a significant time before the termination hearing, he showed little to no interest in obtaining any information regarding L.G.'s medical and developmental needs.  As a result, Matt's termination was deemed in the best interest of the child.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Matt consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $25,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  He also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar, with the right to reapply at a later date upon motion by the court upon his motion for a hearing on the same day.  Gibson agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 105.001(b)(2) and (3) and ordering him to comply with the court-ordered service plan. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-12-00612-CV."
