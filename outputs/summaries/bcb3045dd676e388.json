  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against a former manager of a Texas convenience store for engaging in a pattern of misconduct that resulted in her termination.  According to the SEC's complaint, Norma Mora was terminated on December 22, 2011, shortly after she told her supervisor that she was going to be stepping down as manager to start her own business.  The complaint alleges that shortly after telling Mora about her plans to step down, Silva allegedly began harassing and intimidating her.  As alleged in the complaint, Mora allegedly filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) alleging that Silva had given her three written warnings for tardiness, which she admitted was true, and that he did not treat her the same as similarly situated males.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the EEOC has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Mora from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of her ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Mora arising from the same conduct alleged in her complaint.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action charging Mora with violations of the anti-discrimination provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of The Securities Act of 1933.  It also charged Mora as a defendant in a civil action brought by the Commission on Civil Rights in the United States District Court for the Central District of New York.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
