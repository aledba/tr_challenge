  "summary": "On August 6, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of New York entered a final judgment against Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Costco Wholesale Corp., and Procter & Gamble Co., in a class action action brought by New York residents alleging that they were harmed by the company's use of \"flushable\" toilet wipes.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, from February 2010 through May 2019, Christopher R. Weir conducted a hedonic regression analysis of toilet wipes to determine whether there was a market-wide price premium for flushable wipes. The complaint alleges that Weir's model, which he performed on behalf of the company, was inaccurate because it failed to account for the price premium that consumers paid for the wipes. In addition, according to the complaint, Weir made statistical errors in his regression analysis and failed to adequately account for any significant price premium associated with the flushable claim.  The complaint also alleges that, contrary to Weir's claims, the model is not reliable in demonstrating whether there is a marketwide pricing premium for a flushable wipe.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced parallel criminal charges against Weir. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David L. Ferstendig and Carol A. Scott and supervised by Marc Blau. The litigation will be led by Mr. Ferndendig. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter and Ms. Scott.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
