  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Nevada today entered summary judgment against defendants Robert G. Reynolds and Diamanti Fine Jewelers, LLC, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Las Vegas, Nevada, alleges that, by purchasing the rights and interests of certain of the defendants, Reynolds and Tufenkjian and Luxury, Inc., Reynolds violated the federal securities laws by failing to assign the defendants' claims to the defendants at an execution sale.  According to the complaint, Reynolds also violated the anti-fraud provision of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, which prohibits the assignment of claims to a third party.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Reynolds violated Section 17(a)(1)(A)(B) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of Exchange Act Rules 5(b)(5) and (c) thereunder, and that, in violation of Rule 5b2-1, Reynolds consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 5, and orders him to pay $57,941.92 in attorney fees and costs.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Reynolds agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the securities laws and to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, other than for his own personal use.  He also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties he will pay as a result of the judgment.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  On November 1, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court against Reynolds and charged him with violations of Section 15(a).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for Nevada today announced criminal charges against Reynolds.  Among other things, Reynolds has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and to pay civil penalties of $50,000.  Reynolds has also agreed not to participate in an SEC proceeding that is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
