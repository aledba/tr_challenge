  "summary": "On June 5, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Cellino & Cellino, LLP (\"C&C\"), a personal injury law firm in which Barnes and non-party Ross Cellino have been partners or co-owners since 1992.  The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, ordering the dissolution of C&C, and ordering the filing of a civil injunctive action against Barnes.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in New York, Barnes and Cellino violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Barnes consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Barnes arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  On June 21, 2020, the Honorable Deborah A. Chimes of the New York State Supreme Court granted a temporary injunction against Barnes and ordered him to comply with the pleading burden set forth in Rule 23.1 of the Exchange Act.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David A. Schiff and Eric R. Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Stephen E. Barnes, Ms. Schiff, and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 24-10 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2008).
