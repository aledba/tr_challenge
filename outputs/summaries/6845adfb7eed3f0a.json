  "summary": "On August 16, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Ohio defendant Wayne Powell for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court granted Powell's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay a $2,500 civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, Powell was indicted on one count of aggravated arson, ten counts of aggravated murder, and 26 capital specifications. The complaint alleges that the trial court improperly denied Powell's request for expert funding in postconviction reviews of capital cases. The SEC alleges that Powell was not entitled to expert funding because he had a \"particularly great\" need for expert witnesses, including family members, a juvenile probation officer, and a psychologist, and that he was ineffective for not presenting expert testimony during the mitigation phase of the trial. The court also ruled that Powell could not afford to pay the civil penalty because he was already sentenced to death.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Ohio today announced criminal charges against Powell arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint. The case was investigated by the Ohio Department of Justice's Office of Criminal Investigations, which issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Criminal Justice's Analysis and Detection Center. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Chicago Regional Office. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
