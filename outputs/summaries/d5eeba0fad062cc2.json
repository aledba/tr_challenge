  "summary": "On November 9, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against Amber Raquel Emerson and her husband, Thomas Chad Emerson, that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay $31,055 in disgorgement, interest, and penalties.  The court also ordered that Amber waive her right to appeal the judgment.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, Amber and Thomas entered into a Rule 11 agreement in which they agreed to waive their rights to appeal, and that the court would determine the amount of attorney\u2019s fees and interest owed to each party.  In addition, the court agreed to the waiving of the right to an owelty purchase-money lien on the marital home.  As alleged in the complaint, Amber did not perform the actions required under the settlement agreement, and the trial court did not err in failing to award her court costs or mediation fees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's judgment, Amber consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and ordering the payment of an attorney's fee.  Amber also agreed to pay an additional $597.67 in attorney's fees and an $8,500 civil penalty.  On November 10, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Amber, Thomas, and another defendant in the same action, alleging that Amber violated the antigorgement provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. McCluskey and supervised by Chedly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Secretary of State's Office and the Texas Office of Financial Regulation."
