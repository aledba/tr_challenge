  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the trustee et al.'s motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, alleges that, in a leveraged buyout, Tribune Media Company, Inc., a multimedia company, proposed to acquire the company through an unprofitable offering of shares. The complaint alleges that the company agreed to pay $11 billion in interest and a $315 million civil penalty, and that the settlement was subject to court approval. According to the complaint, the settlement is subject to the court\u2019s approval. The SEC also found that, as a result of the settlement, the company was able to avoid certain of the alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 546(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  In a related matter, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Tribune, charging it with violating Section 545(e). The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The court granted the SEC's request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary asset freeze, and entered an order appointing a receiver for the receiver. The receiver will determine the amount of interest and civil monetary penalties to be imposed by the court upon the receiver and the receiver will be determined by the receiver upon motion of the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the receiver has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty. The trustee has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The final judgment orders the receiver to comply with the court's order, and requires him to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver in the event of a default. The receivership order also requires that the receiver be accompanied by a trustee.  To learn more about asset freezes and asset freezes, see Litigation Trust Co. v. Converse, No. 547(a)(1)(A).  The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson and Joseph G. Sansone. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in this matter."
