  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Secretary of Health and Human Services for failing to comply with the federal preclusion statute.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the Secretary violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he failed to adequately account for the additional, unexpected -0.4588% recoupment adjustment made in fiscal year 2017.  According to the complaint, the Secretary also failed to inform the court that the adjustment required under Section 7(b)(1)(B) was not subject to judicial review.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of the Secretary's actions, the federal government was unable to recover the $11 billion in overpayments from fiscal years 2010, 2011, and 2012.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Secretary from violating the preclusion provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (Aug. 22, 2016).  The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
