  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Social Security Administration's (SSA) motion to revoke the agency's (ALJ) denial of a claim for permanent disability.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the SEC improperly disregarded the recommendation of a state agency non-examining consultant, Dr. Scott Walker, M.D., who assessed Ms. Rush's ability to perform work-related tasks.  According to the complaint, Walker also failed to mention that, contrary to the ALJ's recommendation, the claimant has not experienced a seizure since 2006, even though she stopped taking Keppra on her own.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Dr. Walker failed to include in his recommendation that the claimant should be limited to simple, routine tasks, such as maintaining attention and concentration, and that she should not rely on Dr. Hall's opinion when performing work related to her impairment.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, Walker consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Walker also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  On May 9, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in Manhattan against Walker, alleging that he violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Walker violated Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Section 10-b) and Rule 12b2(a) thereunder and that Walker aided and abetted Walker's violations of Section 12(b)(2) and 13(a).  The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a conduct-based injunction against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) of The Exchange Act. The SEC is seeking a temporary restraining order, an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the claimant's medical records, and to issue an order appointing a receiver to evaluate her progress.  Among other things, Walker agreed to the appointment of an independent receiver to determine whether the claimant had sufficient capacity to perform any work"
