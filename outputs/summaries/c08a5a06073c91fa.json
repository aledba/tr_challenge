  "summary": "On November 21, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri entered a final judgment against Cynthia J. Underwood, a former member of American Professional Driver Academy, LLC (APDA), for her role in a fraudulent and/or illegal filing of a false complaint.  The court found that Underwood violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 5b-5(b) and (c) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in her amended complaint, Underwood consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Underwood also agreed to be barred from the business premises of APDA, barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Underwood.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Missouri, underwood, Nunn, and Blair formed APDA in 2013 and, together with Nunn and Blair, formed Kahala in 2014. The complaint alleges that underwood and Nunn violated their fiduciary duty by expelling her as a member on March 6, 2016, without the written consent of all of the members of the company. The SEC also charged Underwood as a defendant in a separate action in 2015 for his failure to properly manage and manage APDA.  On November 6, 2015, the court granted a motion to dismiss by way of motion from Underwood and Kahala, and granted the motion for summary judgment from the trial court on November 7, 2015. The court granted the request to dismiss on November 8, 2015 and granted a preliminary injunction from further violations of Section 347.123(a)(1) and Rule 347.04(c).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Grellner and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1531-CC01365.
