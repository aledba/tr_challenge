  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New Mexico today entered final judgments against Anita Gianardi and her husband, Marc Anthony Correra, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, alleges that Gianardi, through her now-defunct law firm, L2 Capital Partners, LLC, and L2 Investment Advisors LLC, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to steal documents related to the Debtor's bankruptcy proceedings.  According to the complaint, Gianardi's husband, who is not admitted to the U. S. District court for the Southern District, allegedly used a tool called \"wiping\" to create a pattern of useless data on the hard drive.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, on at least one occasion, a Debtor entered into an agreement with Ms. Gianardi to remove documents from her computer, which she did not produce.  As alleged in the complaint:  The Debtor filed for bankruptcy in early 2016, and the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and then ordered the filing of a civil injunctive action against Gianardi.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar.  Gianardi also agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000 and $2,500, respectively.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.
