  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee today entered a final judgment against a Tennessee-based real estate developer for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sevier County, Tennessee, alleges that Sandra Gunn, the president of Innerimages, Inc. (now known as Cupid's Rose, LLC), and David and Joan Barrett, the property owner and sole shareholder of The Village, engaged in a fraudulent scheme to acquire and maintain The Village. According to the complaint, Gunn and Barrett were unaware of the restrictive covenants and that the developer failed to comply with them. The complaint further alleges that Gunn failed to provide proof of the developer's failure to fulfill his obligations under the covenants, and that she was personally liable for the $1,125 plus interest, attorney's fees, and costs incurred by the property owners. The court also denied Gunn's request for an attorney's fee.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Gunn.  On March 21, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Gunn, raising the issue of whether the court should order Gunn to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay civil penalties, and pay disgorgement of $2,065 plus interest and penalties totaling $3,078. The SEC also issued an order suspending Gunn from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Gunn consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) and orders her to pay civil monetary penalties of $650,000. The judgment also prohibits Gunn from participating in any offering of a penny stock, and bars Gunn from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (Feb. 21, 2015).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, under the supervision of Amy C. McKinley.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Tennessee Department of Commerce, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Tennessee Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
