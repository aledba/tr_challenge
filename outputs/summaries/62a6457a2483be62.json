  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of multiple felony counts in connection with a series of masked burglaries.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City on November 3, 2014, Mark Perlin was convicted of nine felony counts, including two counts of burglary in the first degree, three counts of rape in the second degree, and one count of criminal sexual abuse in the third degree.  The SEC alleges that Perlin, who was a guest at her home roughly twice a week in the months leading up to the September 2013 incident, was the only defendant to be convicted of all nine of the charges.  Perlin also was convicted on the remaining nine counts of the indictment, which arose out of the June 2011 and September 2013 incidents.  As alleged in the complaint, Perlin consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Perlin.  On November 4, 2016, the U.N. Attorney's office for the Northern District of California announced criminal sanctions against Perlins.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a $150,000 civil penalty.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, to be followed by a five-year officer-director bar, and to be permanently enjoined from participating in any offering of securities or offering of any securities in the future.  Under the terms of the settlement, Perlins will be permanently barred from soliciting or offering to sell securities in any public company, and he will be required to pay disgorgement of $40,000 plus prejudgment interests in the amount of $100,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release Order No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, under the supervision of Eric R. Werner."
