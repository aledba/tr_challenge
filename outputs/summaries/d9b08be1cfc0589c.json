  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Honeywell International, Inc., a Pennsylvania-based manufacturer of coke ovens, for failing to adequately inform its customers of the dangers inherent to the ovens.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, from 1966 to 1993, Honeywell, as successor-in-interest to Wilputte, marketed and sold a series of \"coke oven batteries\" designed and manufactured in the United States and in Mexico and Canada.  As alleged in the complaint, these ovens were not products and therefore did not qualify as products for purposes of strict products liability.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of this conduct, the company was not in a position to adequately assess the safety of its ovens and did not owe a duty to warn to its customers.  In addition, the complaint alleges, as alleged, that the oven batteries at issue did not fall within a \"duty to warn\" category of products, and that, in addition to being products, they are not products that are liable for strict liability as a matter of law.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Honeywell from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the company to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer and director bar.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court of Appeals granted the court's motion for summary judgment and entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants, ordering a conduct-based injunction, imposing a civil penalty, and imposing an officer-and-director bar against each of the defendants.  Separately, the Court issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the operation and maintenance of the Coke oven battery, ordering the receiver to provide an accurate and timely accounting of the oven battery's components, and ordering a hearing on May 25, 2018 to determine whether to issue a civil injunctive relief order.  A hearing for the receiver is scheduled for May 26, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 17, 2018)."
