  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against Boston Police Officer Shawn Marando and Charbel Kamel in a civil injunctive action brought by the District Attorney's Office.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that, on June 14, 2011, while on the sidewalk with her sister, Niquel Reid, three Boston police officers, responding to a 911 call from the plaintiff's sister, approached Cummings from behind, intending to conduct a pat-frisk. Instead, the complaint alleges, one of the officers held a gun from his waistband and fired at Cummings, causing the plaintiff to fall to the ground. According to the complaint, the officers' actions were not sufficient to prevent Cummings from committing a serious injury. The complaint alleges that the officers acted negligently, breached their duty of care, and actually caused injury to the plaintiff. The SEC also alleges that Kamel and Marando violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(h) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the defendants violated the broker-dealer registration provision of the federal securities laws. The court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of $253,391.73 plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers posed by third-party securities fraud.
