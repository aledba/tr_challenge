  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against a Michigan-based insurance company for making a material misrepresentation in an insurance policy application.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ann Arbor, Michigan, alleges that MeEMIC Insurance Company (MEEMIC) violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to provide a copy of its underwriting guidelines for its insurance policies. The SEC alleges that MEEMIC violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") (\"Exchanges Act\"). The SEC further alleges that the defendants violated the \"ambiguous\" nature of the underwriting, and therefore, were not permitted to seek rescission of the insurance policy. In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose that plaintiff was not employed by a school at the time she submitted her insurance application. The complaint also alleges that, despite her misrepresentation regarding the identity of her employer on her insurance policy, MEemIC was not entitled to rescind the policy based on her innocent misrepresentation. The court also ruled that MEEMSIC was entitled to seek summary disposition of its insurance policy on the basis of a material fact or circumstance.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against MeemIC.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on June 13, 2011, the SEC obtained a temporary restraining order against MeEMic and issued it with an order suspending the company's registration with the SEC. The order also ordered MEEMI to provide an accounting of the amount of premium paid to the insurance company in its annual report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2016.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, MeEMI consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins it from violating the above-mentioned provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
