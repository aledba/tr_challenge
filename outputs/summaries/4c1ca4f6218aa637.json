  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Mt. San Jacinto Community College District, a community college located in Wildomar, California, for failing to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIR) before it acquired the property.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Riverside County, California on May 29, 2014, the college agreed to acquire the property for $4.8 million before it even began preparing an EIR. The college also agreed to pay $1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The court also found that the college failed to adequately prepare the EIR for its purchase agreement with the regional park district.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the school district and the college consented to the court's order, which permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the college to pay disgorge interest of $1.4 million and prejudgment interests of $192,768.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court denied the college\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction and ordered it to prepare a final EIR before proceeding with the purchase agreement.  On May 31, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the college, charging it with violations of Section 15(a)(1) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder of the federal securities laws, and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The court granted the college a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against it. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Bridges and Mr. Burkett. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter."
