  "summary": "On January 7, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania State Trooper who was arrested for refusing to submit to a chemical test after being arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in York County, Pennsylvania, alleges that on September 10, 2016, while on routine patrol on southbound Interstate 83 in Conewago Township, Pa., State Trooper Raymond R. Rutter (Arresting Officer) observed a Ford Escape in front of Licensee weaving in and out of the right lane and entering a field sobriety test.  According to the complaint, the officer read the DL-26 warnings to Licensee, which stated that a refusal of chemical testing will result in a one-year suspension of her driving privileges.  In addition, the complaint alleges that during the course of the stop-and-frisk process, the arresting officer allegedly read Licensee the DL\u201326 warnings and told her that she had the option of refusing the chemical test without repercussions.  As alleged, however, Licensee was so confused that she did not respond to the officer's repeated requests for a blood test that she nearly collapsed in the back of the car and was later transported to the booking center.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Rutter consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Rutter also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Finally, the court granted Rutter's request for a temporary restraining order against Licensee from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordered him to comply with the court's order that he pay a $250,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer and director bar.  A hearing scheduled for February 13, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. for Licensee to respond to a question about her ability to consent to chemical testing.   The hearing was conducted in the absence of an attorney, and the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, and Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
