  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Honeywell International, Inc. (\"Honeywell\"), a New Jersey-based company that manufactures and sells automotive and aerospace products.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, Honeywell and its predecessor, Aetna Casualty & Surety Company (Aetna), were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that, in violation of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, the defendants were not required to participate in the allocation of liability for claims arising from exposure to asbestos-related products. In addition, the complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to adequately account for the fact that they were not entitled to insurance coverage for products that were not covered by the insurance policies.

On the same day, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in New Jersey charging Honeywell with violating Exchange Act Rules 15b-20, 13a-21, and 13b-24, and with aiding and abetting violations of Section 17(a)(1) of The Exchange Act and Rules 17a-3, 13b1-1 thereunder and the related allocation methodology under Section 206(3).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced that it filed a parallel criminal case against Bendix in which Bendix pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and ordered to pay a $1 million civil penalty. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John R. Rymas and Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation"
