  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri on May 1, 2019 entered a final judgment against Randall Zweifel for contempt of court for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, on May 2, 2012, Zweefel and Smith agreed to settle a civil contempt case by agreeing to pay $415,381.72 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC alleges that, in a parallel action, the court found that Smith violated Section 5.02 of the federal securities laws and that he was entitled to renew advertising to existing residential customers after the expiration of the non-solicitation and non-compete provision in the 2014 settlement and judgment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Smith consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions and orders him to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest and a penalty.  In a parallel administrative proceeding, the federal court entered a judgment ordering the court to determine whether to impose a permanent injunction and order the issuance of a civil injunctive relief.  On May 3, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court in the District of Columbia, alleging that ZWEifel violated the anti-touting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 17a-1 thereunder, as well as Section 5(b)(5)(A) and (c) thereunder of the Exchange Act and Rules 5b2-1 and (3) and 5a-3 thereunder and ordering Zweiefel to pay civil penalties of up to $1,000,000.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order and issued a cease-and-desist order in the case of Smith, ordering him to comply with the SEC\u2019s requests for an asset freeze, and ordering the appointment of a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.  A hearing on May 4, 2019 was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. EST.
