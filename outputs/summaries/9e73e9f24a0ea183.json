  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment in favor of Utah Stream Access Coalition, a Utah-based organization that seeks to preserve and protect the rights of Utah residents to access and use public waters.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order halting the litigation.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, the Utah Division of Enforcement (DAL) issued an order suspending the issuance of an emergency court order temporarily halting the pending litigation. The court ruled that the DAL order violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that DAL's order temporarily suspended the litigation pending final approval of the final judgment.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Utah today announced criminal charges against DAL for its role in this matter. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Denver Regional Office and the Salt Lake Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Utah Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Utah Office of Inspector General.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17(b)(5) of July 17, 2018."
