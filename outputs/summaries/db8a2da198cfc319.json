  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Millview County Water District, a company controlled by Hill and Gomes, that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1021 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The court also issued an order suspending the issuance of a cease-and-desist order, which temporarily halted Millview's diversion of water under the Waldteufel claim.  According to the court's order, Millview, Hill, Gomes and their companies agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In a parallel action, the California Department of Health Services (CDO) issued a cease and desist order on August 28, 2015, which permanently enjoined Millview from future violations of the federal securities laws.  On September 2, 2016, the court granted the Board's request for an asset freeze and other emergency relief, including a temporary restraining order and a temporary asset freeze, and ordered Millview to pay $2.1 million in attorney fees and $247,028 in interest and a civil penalty of $2,131,500.  Without admitting to the charges in the proposed CDO, the defendants consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from future violation of the anti-fraud provisions, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of $500,000 and $250,000, respectively.  Millview also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Gomes has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently barred from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  Hill has also agreed not to participate in the litigation, and to be prohibited from associating with any third party in a case where he or she has a significant financial incentive to do so.  Additionally, Hill agreed to the appointment of a receiver to determine the appropriate amount of attorney fees to be paid to him or her.  As a result of the settlement, the District of Los Angeles has not agreed to pay any additional attorney fees under section 1021.5, and the receiver will not be entitled to an award until the litigation is resolved by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1021-5 (2014).
