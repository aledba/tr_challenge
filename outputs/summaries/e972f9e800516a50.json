  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Buffalo, New York-based occupational therapist who was previously barred by the Social Security Administration from performing any type of work as a customer service representative.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 8, 2015, Anne Marie Filer, a resident of Buffalo, N.Y., filed an application for disability insurance benefits in the agency's Office of Clinical Education and Advocacy. The complaint alleges that, in completing her functional capacity evaluation, Filer observed that Plaintiff was moderately limited in standing, bending, kneeling, and overhead reaching, which is the ability to perform physical or mental work activities on a sustained basis, notwithstanding limitations for the collective impairments.  The complaint further alleges that Filer did not meet her burden to prove that Plaintiff could perform her PRW as generally performed because she had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since April 30, 2015.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Filer from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the Court issued a temporary restraining order against Filer. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Ms. Filer and Ms. Thompson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Buffalo Regional Office, and the Buffalo Office of the Chief of the Department of Health and Human Services."
