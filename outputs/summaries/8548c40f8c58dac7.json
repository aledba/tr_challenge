  "summary": "On October 18, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan entered a final judgment against Debtor-Appellee Spiech Farms, LLC, a grower and processor of blueberries, asparagus, and grapes. The court granted the bankruptcy court's request for an asset freeze and other emergency relief.  According to the court's order, the court improperly relied upon state law to determine whether certain financing arrangements with buyers of perishable agricultural commodities can create a \"burden on commerce in perishable agriculture commodities\" and are \"contrary to the public interest.\"  The court also ruled that, as alleged in its order, Spieech had not acquired ownership of any of the produce in its possession, and thus did not have the right to assert a claim against the bankruptcy estate.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Michigan, alleges that, in September 2018, a bankruptcy court denied the bankruptcy defendant's motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the company, and ordering the company to pay a civil penalty of $1,002,273.70.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to those imposed by the court.  On November 20, 2018 the court issued an order suspending the asset freeze pending final approval of the judgment.  A hearing is scheduled for October 26, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 524 (4th Cir. 2013).  The case is being supervised by C.H. Robinson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Michigan Department of Commerce, the State Attorney General's Office, the Department of Banking and Securities, the Federal Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service, the Pennsylvania Department of Justice, the Ohio Department of Insurance, the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office."
