  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Henry County man who was convicted of two counts of armed robbery and one count of possession of an illegal weapon.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that on March 7, 2013, three Dollar General stores in Henry County were robbed at gunpoint.  According to the complaint, Albright was arrested in July 2013, several months after the crimes at issue. The complaint alleges that Albright told his trial counsel that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the car and that he would like to suppress the evidence presented to the court. Albright also alleges that the trial counsel failed to disclose that the car was illegally seized pursuant to the Ponzi scheme. The SEC alleges that, in fact, the car had been stolen in the course of a high-speed chase that resulted in the officers\u2019 arrest.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Albright.  Among other things, the SEC charged Albright with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charged him with aiding and abetting the violations of Section 17-7 of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The judgment also prohibits Albright from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the conduct of a federal criminal investigation. The court also ordered Albright to pay disgorgement of $1,829.95, prejudgment interest of $2,965.87, and a $100,000 civil penalty.  Albright agreed to settle the SEC action by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(5) of Securities Act of 1933. The settlement is subject to court approval.  An SEC order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver will determine the amount of restitution to be paid. The receiver will also be required to provide a copy of the SEC's order to the receiver.  A hearing for Albright is scheduled for May 24, 2019.  On June 13, 2019, the court granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction against future violations"
