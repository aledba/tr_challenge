  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Riley for violating a restraining order issued in 2011.  The court found that Riley violated the restraining order on multiple occasions.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Riley, a California Highway Patrol officer, and his wife, Dawn Riley, agreed to a five-year restraining order that prohibited them from participating in extracurricular activities during Rybolt\u2019s parenting time.  Riley also agreed to be barred from attending school events and sporting events during his parenting time, and to be restrained at least 25 yards away from Rybolt.  In addition, the court ruled that Riley had a \"reasonable apprehension\" of future abuse, and that he did not have to show up to events because he had a reasonable apprehension of imminent serious bodily injury.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Riley consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the order, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.   The final judgment also prohibits Riley from violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and requires him to comply with the court's order for him to show cause and effect, including, among other things, that he has reasonable apprehension about future abuse.  Additionally, it requires Riley to provide proof of his prior history of abuse, including that he had been suspended from law school for dishonesty and that a previous restraining order he signed in 2011 had been rescinded in 2013.  Finally, Riley has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Jaime Rom\u00e1n of the United States District Court in Manhattan entered a judgment ordering a temporary restraining order against Riley, ordering Riley to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $1.5 million.  Rybolt agreed to the settlement without admitting or denied the allegations of the complaint and to the appointment of a receiver to determine whether to issue a permanent restraining order.  She also agreed not to participate in any activities that are not part of the regular school curriculum, including sporting events such as baseball and swimming.  He also agreed that the court should consider the health and safety of Rybolt and her family members, such as her husband, Joshua McGourty, and others for the purpose of renewing the order."
