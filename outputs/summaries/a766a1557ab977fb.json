  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against a juvenile who was improperly granted the right to counsel in a juvenile delinquency proceeding.  The court entered the final judgment on consent against J.V.D., who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Denver, J.D. opened the window of his neighbor's trailer, but left after the neighbor's face appeared in the window.  As alleged in the complaint, the juvenile's waiver was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent, and it did not require the juvenile to consent to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and requires him to pay a civil penalty.  In addition, the court did not consider whether the juvenile had been coerced in any way, including by his refusal to give an opening statement or call any witnesses.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the juvenile court acted unethically and improperly by appointing a guardian ad litem, or GAL, to represent him in a case where he had been charged with a felony.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's judgment, the defendant consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and appointing a public defender. The court granted the juvenile judge's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, and orders the defendant to pay disgorgement of $1,078, which represents $2,098 in interest, a $100,000 civil penalty, and a $50,000 officer-and-director bar. The final judgment also orders the court to determine whether to appoint a GAL to represent the juvenile in a future criminal proceeding. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David J. Arguello and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Department of Juvenile Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado Office of Inspector General in this matter."
