  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against LeAndre Martell, a California man who was charged with unlawfully taking or driving a car.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Victorville, California, Martell and his girlfriend, Jasmine, were in the process of moving from Los Angeles to Las Vegas when Martell allegedly stole their car. The complaint alleges that Martell told Jasmine he needed to get some money, left in Jasmine's 10-year-old Chevy Malibu, which he had been driving with her permission for about a month, and drove to Los Angeles with the intent to steal the car. He allegedly left the car in the car and drove off in the morning, leaving Jasmine with the car when she called the police. Martell's girlfriend, who was also a victim of the alleged theft, told the court that she had asked Martell repeatedly to return the car, but he didn't. She also allegedly told Martell she didn't want him to drive the car after she reported the car stolen. The court ultimately found Martell guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Martell to pay a civil penalty of $950,000.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Justice, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
