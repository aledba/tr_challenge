  "summary": "On March 20, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 10 years in prison for distribution of a Schedule II controlled dangerous substance (CDS).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that on April 21, 2016, Deputies from the DeSoto Parish Sheriff's Office met with a confidential informant to conduct controlled buys of crack cocaine from the defendant, James Williams. According to the complaint, the CI was wired with an audio/video recording device and was given money to purchase the drugs. The complaint further alleges that the CI never deviated from his route, removed any article of clothing, or did any act to suggest that he obtained the drugs from a source other than the defendant. The SEC alleges that, in finding the defendant guilty as charged, the defendant waived his right to a jury trial and was ordered to pay a civil penalty of $50,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Williams.  On March 21, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Williams, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Williams's violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar.  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Inspector General, and the Louisiana Department of Corrections in this matter."
