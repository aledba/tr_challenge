  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of Initiative Legal Group, Inc., a class of home mortgage consultants, against Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, Inc. (ILG).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, California, alleges that ILG violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  ILG also alleges that the court improperly ordered ILG to pay $5.5 million in attorney's fees, without court approval, out of a $6 million settlement with Wells Fargo.  According to the complaint, ILG was not entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and instead paid $5,520,000 to its clients, including ILG\u2019s clients.  The complaint also alleges ILG failed to disclose to the court that it had obtained a temporary restraining order and an order directing it to disgorge $5 million of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $750,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against ILG for its role in the Lofton settlement.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of $6,500, plus interest thereon, and ordering ILG and its clients to pay civil penalties equal to the amount of their fees paid out of the settlement funds.  Finally, the court granted ILG's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered it to pay a $9,391,500 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  On June 24, 2015, a federal district court in Los Angeles issued an order granting the SEC's request for an emergency asset freeze and freezing the assets of ILG.  A hearing scheduled for June 26, 2015 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.
