  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the City of Costa Mesa and its employees in a civil injunctive action brought by the city.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Costa Mesa, California, alleges that city employees made numerous false statements to potential tenants and construction contractors in connection with the city's refusal to issue licenses to medical marijuana dispensaries at the property.  According to the complaint, the employees allegedly told one of the prospective tenants that the property was \"full of prostitutes\" and that the city would not issue business licenses to the businesses because of the ongoing litigation.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the City and the employees made false statements about the property in the context of potential tenants attempting to obtain business licenses at the Property.  As alleged, the city and the employee also allegedly told the tenant that there was \"no such thing as a real con job\" at theproperty because the city had been documenting for over a year the various comings and goings at this property and documented wrongdoing at the business.  Finally, the defendants allegedly told a prospective tenant that \"there [was] a lot of illegal activity there, but the city has never issued any business licenses for the property.\"  The complaint further alleges that Ashabi and Lee made false and misleading statements in the cross-complaint, which were not supported by the facts presented in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's judgment, the City has consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the city to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  On November 3, 2011, the court granted the City's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 425.16 of the federal securities laws, and ordered the City to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $2,500,000 and $1 million, respectively, for each of the defendants' alleged violations of the anti-SLAPP provisions.  At the same time, the Commission issued a temporary restraining order against Lee and Ashabi, ordering the City not to issue any licenses to any of the businesses, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against Lee, as well as an officer-and-director bar against Lee.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Shank and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the San Diego Regional Office. "
