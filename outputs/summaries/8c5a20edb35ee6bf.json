  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a former probation violator.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Esmeralda Pina, 44, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") by failing to report to her probation-revocation counsel and failing to comply with drug treatment recommendations.  According to the complaint, defendant initially reported that she first used cocaine in 2001 and last used it on the date of her arrest for the underlying charges in September 2013.  In January 2016, the trial court granted her probation and sentenced her to 30 months' probation.  After a hearing on the matter, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered that defendant serve a five-year prison sentence.  As alleged, defendant continued to use cocaine and was essentially \"committing a new felony\" with each additional possession and use of the drug.  On August 23, 2019, a federal district court in Manhattan entered a final judgment against Pina that permanently restrains her from violating the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty of three years' imprisonment.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Pina consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the securities laws, ordering her to be barred from serving any prison term, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against her.  Pina also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in a residential substance abuse treatment program.  A hearing on August 24, 2019 was scheduled for 5:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against her from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of the United States District Judge in the Division of Criminal Justice, and the case was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice Criminal Division, the Internal Revenue Service, the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services, the State Attorney General's Office, the FBI's Criminal Investigations Division and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment."
