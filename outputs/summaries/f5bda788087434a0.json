  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas yesterday entered a final judgment against the City of Killeen in a civil injunctive action brought by the relatives of two Texas residents who were injured in an automobile accident.  The court found that the city had actual notice of the accident and that it was liable for the deaths.  According to the court's order, however, the city did not have actual notice.  As alleged in the complaint, the City's failure to provide actual notice to a governmental unit resulted in the deaths of Scott Worsdale and Heike King, both of whom were seriously injured.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the city for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court also ordered the city to comply with the Commission's order to remove the dirt mound from the road and install permanent barricades and signage.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, charges the City with violating Section 101.101 of the Exchange Act, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  It also seeks a preliminary injunction, an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, and an officer and director bar against future violations of the federal securities laws. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by the Texas Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious patterns.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
