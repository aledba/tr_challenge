  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Mexico today entered a final judgment against the Fort Sill Apache Tribe, a New Mexico-based tribe, in an administrative proceeding related to the tribe's alleged mishandling of an Indian Trust Fund.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in New Mexico on May 12, 2015, the tribe filed an administrative record with the Department of the Interior in violation of the attorney-client privilege.  The court found that the tribe was not in possession of the full administrative record when it submitted its complaint to the DOI in 2014 and that the DOI had failed to consider the Tribe's claims in reaching its final decision.  In its order, the court found, without admitting or denying the allegations, that the Tribe was not entitled to the full record because it was not a federally acknowledged tribe.  As alleged in the complaint, the Tribe also alleges that the Solicitor's Letter, which was drafted by the tribe, was arbitrary and capricious, and did not consider the facts in the 2015 decision as to whether the tribe had violated the federal securities laws.  On May 24, 2016, the Court granted a temporary restraining order and ordered the Tribe to complete the record, which is subject to court approval.    The Court's order also prohibits the Tribe from commenting on the merits of the litigation. \u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the tribe.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's complaint charges the tribe with violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting the allegations in the SEC's action, however, the Fortsill Apache tribe has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933, and orders the tribe to comply with the court order.  It also seeks an order requiring the tribe not to violate the federal laws, including Section 10\u00c2\u00a0of the Exchange Act, and to pay a penalty equal to the amount of the tribe\u2019s legal fees.  Additionally, the complaint seeks an injunction prohibiting the tribe from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any casino, including the right to reapply as a member of a recognized tribe after five years of imprisonment.  Finally, the SEC has agreed to the appointment of a receiver to facilitate the processing of the administrative record. "
