  "summary": "On November 8, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Rhode Island entered a final judgment in favor of the city of Providence and the Retirement Board of the Employees Retirement System of the City of Providence in an emergency action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Providence, Rhode Island, alleges that, in October 2000, the Providence Fire Department granted plaintiff an accidental disability pension for his on-the-job shoulder injury.  According to the complaint, the board subsequently ordered plaintiff to submit to an independent medical examination (IME) that was conducted by Brian McKeon, M.D., in Boston, Massachusetts, to determine whether he was fit to serve as a firefighter.  As alleged, plaintiff was bedridden and could not travel to Boston for an IME, nor could he withstand a medical examination, and the board ultimately decided to suspend his pension benefits.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the Rhode Island Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On November 9, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the city, charging the defendants with violations of the anti-fraud provision of the state securities laws, and with aiding and abetting the defendants' violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The complaint also charges the city with violating Section 15(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, and seeks a preliminary injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-189(8)(a).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Department of Insurance, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Boston Police Department, the Connecticut Department of Banking, Insurance, and Securities and Exchange Commission and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office."
