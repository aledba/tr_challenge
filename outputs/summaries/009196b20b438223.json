  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California yesterday entered a final judgment against the IRS for failing to provide timely and reasonable notice in advance of an audit.  The court found that the IRS violated Section 7602(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also ordered the IRS to provide the taxpayer with a copy of any third-party contact notice it received from the agency.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in California, J.B. and P.B., who are an elderly married couple living in northern California, received a letter from the IRS stating that they had been selected for an IRS research program audit. The IRS then sent the letter to the couple, informing them that it had received a \"reasonable notice\" in the form of a \"pre-contact notice\" that it would contact the IRS in the future. The complaint alleges that, in reality, the IRS did not receive any such advance notice at all, and the IRS had no reason to believe that it could not contact the couple.  In addition, the court found the IRS liable for violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the SEC has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the IRS from violating these provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000, $2,500, or $3,500. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For additional information, see Litigation Release No. 547 (Dec. 27, 2016).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York in this matter."
