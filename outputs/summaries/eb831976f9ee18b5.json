  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LabCorp) and ChoicePoint, Inc., a New York-based pharmaceutical testing laboratory, for failing to perform and evaluate a random drug test that he was required to take as an airline pilot.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, on June 1, 2007, a physician and part-time Northeastern Aviation Corporation airline pilot was notified by LabCorp that he had been selected for random drug testing pursuant to federal regulations and guidelines.  The complaint alleges that, in performing and evaluating the test, plaintiff produced an insufficient quantity of urine for testing, resulting in an erroneous report of drug use for a probationer.  As alleged in the complaint, the complaint further alleges that Montalvo, a Patient Services Technician for LabCorp, told plaintiff that he would need to produce another urine sample, but did not explain the shy bladder procedure to him or urge him to drink additional fluids, and instead told him to return to the waiting room.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, LabCorp and LabCorp consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering LabCorp to pay a civil penalty of $1,500.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against LabCorp for its role in this matter.  On August 1, 2011, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Last week, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Green of the U.N. Division of Justice issued an order suspending LabCorp from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any drug, alcohol, or other safety-sensitive product for a period of five years.  Judge Green also issued a temporary restraining order halting LabCorp's investigation of the alleged violations of the federal and state laws, ordering the company to provide a copy of the complaint to the court, and appointing a receiver to determine whether to proceed with the investigation.  A hearing is scheduled for September 29, 2014, for which Judge Green will determine the appropriate remedies.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 596 F.Y."
