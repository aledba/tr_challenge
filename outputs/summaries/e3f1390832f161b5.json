  "summary": "On March 18, 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against UBS Real Estate Securities, Inc. (\"UBSRE\"), a Swiss-based real estate investment firm, and its Swiss counterpart, Swiss National Bank (\"SNB\"), for failing to disclose that UBSRE had entered into an agreement with the SNB and a third party fund to acquire and sell its toxic student loan assets.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, UBS and SNB entered into the agreement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  The complaint alleges that the agreement gave plaintiff the exclusive right to solicit counterparties for any potential transaction involving the assets, regardless of whether the parties agreed to a first refusal offer or not.  UBS&rsquo;s alleged failure to do so constituted a breach of contract, as the complaint alleges, in violation of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-3 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint, filed under seal in federal district court in Manhattan, charges UBS with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 13(b)(5) of\u00c2\u00a0the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The Complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On March 19, 2012, the Honorable Deborah M. Bentsen of the New York District Court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins UBS from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders UBS to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty and a $500,000 officer and director bar.  Without admitting to these findings, the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and an officer-and-director bar, and ordered the SEC to conduct a conduct-based investigation into the alleged violations of the anti-fraud provisions.  A hearing is scheduled for May 17, 2012."
