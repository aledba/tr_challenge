  "summary": "On June 1, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York entered a final judgment against the Commissioner of Social Security (the \"Commissioner\") for denying Gualano's application for Supplemental Security Income (SSI).  The Commission's final judgment, which was entered on April 25, 2017, permanently enjoins the Commissioner from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut today announced that it has filed a parallel criminal action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges the Commissioner with violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 5, as well as a conduct-based injunction prohibiting the Commission from issuing or enforcing the above-mentioned orders.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, the Commission consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of\u00c2\u00a0The Exchange Act and Rule\u00c2\u00a0206(4)-8 thereunder.  It also orders the Commission to determine whether the Commission violated Rule 206(3) and (4) the relevant provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(A) of The Exchange Act.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 206 (2d Cir. 2004).  In its order appointing a receiver to determine the receiver of the receiver, the SEC also ordered the receiver to consider all the relevant factors in determining whether the receiver is entitled to controlling weight, including the amount of medical evidence supporting the opinion, the type of treatment the receiver has received, the severity of her impairment, the frequency, length, nature and extent of the treatment relationship, and the extent to which she has suffered from mental impairment. The Commission also ordered that the receiver should consider all of the relevant facts in determining how much weight to give to the receiver's medical opinion.  On June 2, 2018 the Commission issued its final judgment in favor of the claimant, ordering the receiver not to violate the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordering the receivers to comply with the reporting requirements of the Commission. The receiver also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The SEC also issued an order suspending the receiver from appearing or practicing before the Commission as a matter of law, ordering him to provide a copy of the complaint to the Commission"
