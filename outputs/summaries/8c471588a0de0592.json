  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Westport Insurance Corporation, a California-based insurance company, and three of its school administrators in a civil injunctive action brought by three former students of the Moraga School District.  According to the court's order, Westport, through a predecessor company, issued primary general liability insurance policies to the school district from 1991 through 1997. The court found that, under the terms of these policies, the district could not afford to pay the full amount of liability for each of the school's claims.  The court also found that Westport violated the antifraud provisions of Section 825.4 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Westport's complaint, filed in federal court in Contra Costa County, California, alleges that the district court improperly allocated excess liability to Westport based on the number of alleged victims of the alleged molestation.  In its judgment, the court held that, in the event of a serious injury or death, the District was liable for $2.6 million of the $15.8 million owed to the district and three school administrators, and that it was obligated to pay $1 million in prejudgment interest.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Westport complaint, the judge agreed with the court that the District's obligation to defend and indemnify itself to the extent that it could, should, and should require that it pay a sufficient amount to cover the victims' settlements.  On June 26, 2014, a federal district court in San Diego entered a judgment ordering Westport to pay a civil penalty of $2,637.20, which is equal to the amount of the district's indemnification, and ordered the district to pay an amount equal to that amount.  As a result of the settlement, the Calcasieu District Attorney's Office obtained a temporary restraining order and obtained an emergency court order halting the issuance of the restraining order, ordering the district attorney's office to conduct an internal investigation, and ordering the investigation to be conducted by the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations' Risk Analysis and Detection Center, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious patterns of fraud, such as whether a person or organization is liable for a loss arising from an injury or a loss caused by another person or entity. The SEC's complaint charges Westport with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, and civil penalties.  To settle the SEC's case,"
