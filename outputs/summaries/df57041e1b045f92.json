  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Caleb Robert Blank, Jr., a Nebraska man who was convicted of domestic abuse and sentenced to 10 years in prison.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Omaha, Nebraska, alleges that, on May 19, 2011, Caleb and Marissa Blank agreed to joint legal and physical custody of their two minor children. According to the complaint, the court found that Caleb had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he had violated Section 42-364(1)(b) and Rule 42-7 thereunder. The court also found that, contrary to the court's finding, Caleb had engaged in a pattern of domestic violence and had the burden of proving that he was the primary caretaker of the children while they were in the home.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Marissa and Caleb had agreed not to vaccinate the children and to provide support for the children when they were ill.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Caleb consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 42 of the Exchange Act, and orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty. The judgment also prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company or from participating in any form of officer-and-director or director-of-officer disciplinary proceeding.  On May 23, 2017, a federal district court in Nebraska entered a temporary restraining order against Caleb, ordering him to surrender his passport, and barring him from associating with any third party in a custody proceeding. The order also requires him to provide a copy of the complaint to the trial court, which will be reviewed and approved by the court upon motion by the SEC. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Nebraska Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
