  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Damon Bamberg and his mother, Sonya Bamberg, that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Uvalda, Georgia, alleges that, on January 18, 2008, the Bambergs, while in the Jeff Davis County jail awaiting trial, shot and killed their ex-wife, Allison Nicole \"Nikki\" Bamberg.  According to the complaint, Damon and Sonya were in a distinctive car, a 1972 Chevrolet Chevelle with a skull and crossbones front license plate, when they were shot in the head and neck at close range on the first day of a three-day trial.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, after the trial ended, all five of the original trial witnesses testified that they had been shot at the same time, and that Damon had told one of them that he would see them dead before he let them have those boys.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Bamburgs, who were in the jail at the time of the alleged shooting, were not prepared to participate in the reconstruction of the trial transcript, despite repeated requests from the trial court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties of up to $100,000.  Additionally, the court granted a temporary restraining order against Damon, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, ordering him to sign a cease-and-desist order, and to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in the amount of $25,000 and a $50,000 officer and director bar, and requiring him to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court as to whether he is entitled to a new trial under the new Evidence Code.  On March 2, 2019, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the United States District Court in Atlanta entered final judgments against Damon that permanently restrains and enjoin him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Exchange Act, and orders him to disgorge $1,078 in prejudgment interests, pay $2,079 in civil penalties, and pay a $10,000 bar"
