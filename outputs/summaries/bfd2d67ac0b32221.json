  "summary": "On January 10, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the mother and father of four children who were removed from their mother's care for drug-related issues. The court found that the mother violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that, contrary to the court's order, the mother did not substantially comply with the case plan.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, filed on January 30, 2018, the court entered the final judgment ordering the mother to relinquish her parental rights to the children.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against her for her role in the alleged drug-taking.  On January 31, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, charging the mother with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgments, which permanently restrains the mother's and father's parental rights, and orders her to comply with all of the requirements of the federal securities laws.  She also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency for five years.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Tamika White and supervised by Spencer L. Bendell of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. White and Ms. Bendel. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U of N Office of Child and Family Services in this matter."
