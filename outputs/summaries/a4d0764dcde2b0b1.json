  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of North Dakota today entered a preliminary injunction against North Dakota Senate Bill 2289, which is intended to prevent manufacturers from imposing various contractual obligations on farm equipment dealers.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fargo, North Dakota, SB 2289 violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that the federal district court for the Southern District of New York issued a temporary restraining order, which temporarily halted enforcement of the provisions of the federal securities laws.  In its order, the court ruled that the provision of the North Dakota law was a reasonable and legitimate public purpose, and that it was not a special-interest law.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Court also ruled that, in the future, the provision could be amended to permit a dealer to transfer a dealership agreement after notice to the manufacturer and approval of the manufacturer.  For example, the SEC alleges that, as a matter of law, a dealer can not transfer dealership agreements after notice, and the price controls promised lower prices for consumers.  As a result, the dealers could not file an action challenging a manufacturer\u2019s denial of the purchase of the equipment.  On the other hand, in Energy Reserves Group, there was little doubt about the legitimate and legitimate nature of the contract, and there is little doubt that the statute was designed to protect a particular economic actor in the farm economy, such as farmers and rural communities, from being an unprofitable and burdensome burden on the manufacturers.   The SEC also found that, contrary to what the court concluded, the Contract Clause is a reasonable, reasonable, and reasonable way to advance a legitimate state purpose of assisting poor people who were oppressed by debts. \u00c2\u00a0The court also agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins North Dakota from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and orders North Dakota to comply with the proposed amendments to the Securities Act, and to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion of the United States District Court.  Additionally, the order imposes a $10,000 civil penalty on each of the manufacturers, and a $20,000 penalty for each manufacturer that is deemed reasonable and reasonable."
