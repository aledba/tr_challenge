  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against a former employee of the Illinois Department of Rehabilitation Services for misappropriating funds to start a home-based instructional video business.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on October 24, 2016, Todd Williams, a resident of Park Forest, Illinois, raised the issue of whether the agency had sufficient resources to provide vocational rehabilitation services to a person with a hearing disability.  The complaint alleges that the agency failed to provide sufficient funding to provide the services that Williams requested.  In its complaint, Williams alleges that, in 2016, the agency denied Williams's request for $81,138 in cash, which he claimed was sufficient to cover the costs of providing the services.  Williams also alleges that a hearing officer at the agency's hearing in mid-2016 found that Williams did not meet the required burden of proof in his application.  As alleged in the complaint, however, Williams was not entitled to the funds he requested because he did not qualify for the assistance and services that he requested, and the agency did not provide him with the funds to do so.  Specifically, the complaint alleges, Williams failed to show that he had sufficient financial resources to make the requested services available to him, and that the hearing officer failed to determine whether Williams was entitled to receive the funds and other assistance that he sought from the agency.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, Williams consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (\"Advisers\").  The court also granted Williams a temporary restraining order against future violations of the federal securities laws and ordered Williams to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On October 26, 2017, the court granted Williams's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered him to comply with the court order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office, with the assistance of the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations' Office of Inspector General. The litigation will be led by Scott A. Kasper and supervised by Amy S. Cotter. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office."
