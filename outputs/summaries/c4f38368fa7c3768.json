  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Emmanuel Jose Centeno in a criminal case that was unsealed on April 19, 2018. Centeno pled guilty to three felony counts of robbery and one felony count of possession of a firearm.  According to the SEC's complaint, Centeno was sentenced to three years in prison on those counts.  The SEC alleges that Centeno, who pled guilty in a parallel criminal case, announced a robbery at a marijuana dispensary on June 29, 2017.  Centeno allegedly told an employee that he had been in an argument with unknown males when he was shot and that he wished he had thought things through before he committed the robbery.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the trial court did not have discretion to strike the robbery conviction under section 1203.06, and instead imposed a mandatory 25-year-to-life sentence on Centeno.  In a parallel action, on April 20, 2018, a federal district court in San Diego entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Centeno from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Centeno to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his sentence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $25,000.  Additionally, the court entered a temporary restraining order against Centeno and ordered him to surrender his passport.  On April 21, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a preliminary injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.   The court granted the court's motion for a hearing on April 24, 2018 and a hearing scheduled for May 5, 2019. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Banking and Securities, and the Arizona Department of Criminal Justice."
