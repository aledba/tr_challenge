  "summary": "On January 14, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi entered a final judgment against Tronox, LLC, a Mississippi-based independent contractor, for its negligent misrepresentation of the dredging and de-watering services at its plant.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, during the early morning hours of August 12, 2014, George Rice was operating a dredge on a waste pond at the plant. According to the complaint, the dredge was listing to one side and was being removed from service on July 26, 2014. The complaint alleges that Rice was not exposed to the hazard, and that Jimco and Rice knew or reasonably should have known of the danger that caused Rice's death.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Mississippi announced criminal charges against Rice.  On January 19, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking summary judgment, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The SEC also instituted an investigation, which was conducted in the SEC's Office of Inspector General, and the case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mississippi Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Mississippi Department of Commerce, the Alabama Department of Insurance, the State Department of Health, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations Division, the Office of Compliance, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Division of Enforcement, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Mississippi Office of Insurance Regulation."
