  "summary": "On February 23, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Walter McGowan, Jr., a convicted felon with two prior felony convictions, that permanently restrains his 15-year prison sentence.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, on December 18, 2017, McGowan was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the crime of sexual abuse of a child less than 12, a class B felony. The SEC alleges that, in 2016, the court revoked McGowan's probation and ordered him to serve his original 20-year sentence. The court also ordered that McGowan be placed on probation for a period not exceeding three years.  The court's order, however, was unauthorized because the split portion of his sentence was unauthorized.  McGowan pleaded guilty to second-degree assault, a felony, and obstruction of justice, a violation of Section 15-18-8(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5(b) and 15-1(c) thereunder. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the judge granted the court's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the court to revoke the split sentences.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against McGowan. The case was investigated by the SEC Enforcement Division's Office of Inspector General, which issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Department of Justice, and the Alabama Attorney General's Office in this matter."
