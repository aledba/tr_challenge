  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Daymont Underwood, Jr., a convicted felon, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder. Underwood has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to pay a penalty of 360 months to life imprisonment, and imposing a five-year officer-and-director bar. The court also ordered Underwood to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his prior prison time. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's judgment, Underwood consented, on a joint and several basis, to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws and orders him to comply with court orders. The judgment also prohibits Underwood from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any judgment. The final judgment also orders that Underwood be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and that he be prohibited from associating with any person who has a history of criminal conduct with a federal court.  The court's order also prohibits the issuance and purchase of any security-related securities, including securities in the securities industry.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Underwood. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Underwood with violating the anti-jurisdictional provisions of Sections 9(a), 10(b)(5) and 15(a)(1) of federal securities law, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgements of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interests, and civil money penalties. The complaint also seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an order appointing a receiver. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Robert A. Hannan and supervised by Gregory A. Kasper. The Commission on International Affairs has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in this matter."
