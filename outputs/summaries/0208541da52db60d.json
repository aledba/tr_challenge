  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Cube Yadkin Generation, LLC, a company that acquires, develops, and modernizes hydroelectric facilities.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, North Carolina, alleges that the Commission improperly concluded that Cube failed to establish a Legally Enforceable Obligation prior to 15 November 2016.  According to the complaint, the Commission failed to determine whether Cube had substantially complied with all of the prerequisites required by the federal energy rules.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in denying Cube\u2019s request for a waiver of the NOC Form requirement, it failed to show that Cube had complied with the pre-clearance provisions of the federal law.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission, Cube has consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Cube to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000 and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Cube has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $20,000 civil penalty and a $50,000 officer and director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17 (Feb. 22, 2019).  The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David M. Hanauer and Eric R. Werner of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the Atlanta Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in this matter."
