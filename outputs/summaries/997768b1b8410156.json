  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Home Owners Management Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a HOME of Texas, and Warranty Underwriters Insurance, a Texas-based insurance company, in a class action action brought by the Robinsons alleging that Home Owners violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its judgment, the court held that arbitration is a matter of consent, not coercion, and that a court should determine whether a party has agreed to arbitrate class claims.  The court also held that the arbitration provisions in the limited warranty and addendum do not provide for an independent arbitrator to determine whether the parties agreed to arbitration.  According to the court's order, Home Owners and Bazzle agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations in the arbitration agreement, to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and requires them to submit arbitration of class claims to a court or arbitrator.  Home Owners also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Finally, Homeowners agreed to settle the class-action action by agreeing to arbitration of its own accord.  As the court previously ruled in favor of Home Owners' motion for review, the Court of Appeals entered final judgment against Homeowners, finding that it had sufficient authority to impose a civil monetary penalty on Home Owners, and ordering Home Owners to pay $150,000 of the penalty in a separate case.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the United States District Court in San Antonio entered a judgment ordering the court to determine the appropriate conduct of class arbitration, ordering Homeowners to submit class claims, and imposing a $50,000 civil penalty.  This order also imposed a $75,000 bar on Homeowners. \u00c2\u00a0The court also issued an order suspending Homeowners from participating in class arbitration for a period of five years.\u00c2\u00a0 The order also ordered Homeowners not to engage in any type of conduct that constitutes a \"guidance agreement\" with an arbitrator, barring them from engaging in any form of class-based arbitration, and barring Homeowners or Bazzles from acting as an independent broker or representative of a broker-dealer in a case involving a specific broker or dealer.   Homeowners also consented to the issuance of an order requiring arbitration of their own accord, without providing any basis for the arbitrator's determination."
