  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to 16 years in prison.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Ja'Relle Smith violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Smith, who was then 16 years old at the time of the alleged misconduct, was not bound over from a juvenile court to an adult court for the purpose of transferring subject-matter jurisdiction from adult court to adult court.  Smith also was not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus because he was not a juvenile when he committed the felony.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Smith arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Smith consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 16 years and a $1,000,000 civil penalty. The court also issued a temporary restraining order against Smith, freezing his assets, and barring him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged conduct.  A hearing scheduled for March 27, 2012, was scheduled for 3:30 p.m. Eastern time. The hearing was not scheduled for 8:30 a.m., and the hearing was adjourned until 10:30 am.  On March 31, 2018, the court granted Smith's request for a hearing and ordered him to sign a copy of the judgment, which was entered by the court at a later date.  As part of the settlement, Smith agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The final judgment also ordered Smith to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000. The amount of his civil penalty will be determined by the district court upon motion of the court of appeals.  For further information, see Ohio Department of Corrections v. Gaskins II, filed in federal district court in Dayton, Ohio, on March 24, 2018. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Division of Criminal Investigation."
