  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on September 26, 2017 entered a final judgment against Michael A. Massey, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 60 months and three years of supervised release for a previous drug-trafficking conviction.  The court found that Massey violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Massey also agreed to a four-level enhancement, which requires the court to determine whether a defendant has the capability to carry out a serious drug trafficking operation.  According to the court's order, Massey was arrested on May 2, 2016, while driving a vehicle under a suspended license and was stopped by an Ohio State Trooper for a drug possession violation.  As alleged in the court\u2019s order, the defendant had a large and valuable stash of marijuana, which he used to protect and deter others.  In a parallel action, on September 24, 2017, a federal district court in Pennsylvania issued an order suspending Massey from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, or promotion of any federal drug law, and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order Massey consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, imposes a five-year supervised release, and orders Massey to pay an $8,500 civil penalty.  On November 19, 2017 Massey pleaded guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute marijuana and agreed to be permanently enjoined from the securities laws and ordered to pay $2,500 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  He agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (b)(6) and 17(a)(1) and ordering that he pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of marijuana he has already been convicted of and the number of days he has been sentenced to be determined by the court at a later date.  Additionally, the court granted Massey's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 15(a) and 15(b)(2)(B) and ordered him to be restrained and abetted his violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2)(A), and 206(3)(B).  The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
