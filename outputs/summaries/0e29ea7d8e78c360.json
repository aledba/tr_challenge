  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on June 6, 2017, entered a final judgment against Outlaw Brands, Inc., a manufacturer and distributor of male dietary supplements, for failing to state a claim for false advertising under the Lanham Act.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, Outlaw falsely claimed that certain of its products contained \"no harmful chemical\" or \"dietary supplements\" when, in fact, the Rhino Products contained no such chemical.  The complaint also alleges that Outlaw violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The SEC's order, which is subject to court approval, orders Outlaw to comply with the court's order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Outlaw has agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in its complaint, and to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000,000.   The settlement is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Atlanta Office of Inspector General, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Postal Inspection Service and the Federal Office of Regulatory Affairs."
