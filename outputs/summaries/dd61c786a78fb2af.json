  "summary": "On July 21, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi entered summary judgment against a Mississippi County Sheriff's Department employee who was involved in a two-vehicle accident on Highway 6 in Panola County.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Deputy Terry Smith of the agency was negligent in driving across a four-lane divided highway.  According to the complaint, Smith was returning to his office after unsuccessfully attempting to locate a suspect in a case when he failed to yield the right of way.  As alleged, Smith's reckless disregard for the safety and well-being of the Irwins' Buick resulted in a high-impact collision with another car.  In its judgment, the court held that Smith violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Smith consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains with respect to his duties as a public safety officer.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Kelly L. Burkhalter & Co. v. City of Jackson, 844 So.2d 906, 1164 (Miss. Ct. App. 2003).  The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Office of Inspector General in this matter."
