  "summary": "On June 4, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky entered a final judgment ordering a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against three individuals charged with fraud in connection with the filing of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  According to the court's order, filed on May 23, 2019, the Court held that the fees sought by the three individuals were unreasonably high, because they would consume all of the assets of the bankruptcy estate and leave nothing for the estate's creditors.  The court also found that Silverman & Morris, a Kentucky-based bankruptcy law firm, failed to apply the lodestar method when calculating the amount of attorney's fees to award in a bankruptcy case.  In its final judgment, the court held that, in the event of a default judgment by the bankruptcy court, the fees should be adjusted downward, substantially, to maximize distributions that are paid to the creditors in this case. The court further held that certain of the fees requested by the defendants were unreasonable, because the fees were disproportionately high compared to the financial benefit obtained by the estate from the applicants' services.  As a result of the default judgment, Silverman and Morris were not entitled to any higher compensation than the fees they were entitled to, and the court agreed with the court that the fee amount should be reduced.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Court's final opinion, the defendants consented to the entry of a permanent injunction, which prohibits them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock in a public offering of penny stock. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (June 5, 2018).
