  "summary": "On May 25, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered summary judgment in favor of Household Finance Corporation III (Household Finance) on its motion for summary judgment on its mortgage foreclosure action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 29, 2003, Lockhart submitted a mortgage application to Fieldstone Mortgage Co. (Fieldstone) in 2007. The complaint alleges that on May 1, 2006, she received a letter of rescission from Fieldstone stating that the mortgage had an annual interest rate of 9.152%, contained a prepayment penalty, and was in compliance with the terms of her mortgage.  The complaint further alleges that the lender failed to record the mortgage and failed to fulfill its obligations under Section 4(a)(1) of the Mortgage Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 4 of the mortgage, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In a parallel action, on June 3, 2010, a federal district court in Chicago entered a final judgment against Household Finance on its foreclosure action, ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $208,546, and ordering the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver. The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the receiver, preventing the receiver from destroying the receiver's records, and imposing a $20,000 civil penalty.  On June 5, 2018 the court granted the receiver the right to respond to the complaint without prejudice.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Jeffrey M. Goldberg and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
