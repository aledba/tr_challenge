  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Gwinnett County today entered a final judgment against defendant Sean Swanson, finding him liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that Swanson, who was a close friend of Swanson\u2019s, received a call from an acquaintance asking if Coleman would sell marijuana to him. According to the complaint, Coleman and three other friends were in the car with Swanson when he shot Reed. The complaint further alleges that after Swanson shot Reed, Reed continued to threaten and threaten Coleman and the other vehicle occupants, and when Swanson confronted Reed about the matter, Reed pulled out his own Sig Sauer 9-millimeter pistol and shot him twice, killing him. The SEC also charged Swanson with failing to request a jury instruction on defense of habitation.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Swanson.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Swanson and ordered him to surrender his passport. The court granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws and ordered Swanson to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Swanson agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2019 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-cv-2052.   The case is being supervised by Kelly L.
