  "summary": "On March 6, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in a related action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that the FBI violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 17(a)(1), the federal securities laws, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) issued a preliminary injunction against the purchase, manufacture, sale, and sale of bump stocks.  According to the complaint, the FBI's preliminary injunction order was issued on February 20, 2018, and the agency issued a final rule on March 26, 2019. The final rule requires the agency to determine whether it has reasonable grounds to consider whether it is reasonable to issue an injunction.  In its final order, the court found that the agency had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its prior decisions, and that it had not adequately assessed the risks posed to the public.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(d) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. The court also issued a temporary restraining order halting the issuance of the Final Rule, which is subject to court approval.  On March 7, 2020, the SEC filed a complaint against the FBI, charging the agency with violating the federal anti-fraud provision of Section 5(b).  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and an injunction against further violations of the federal registration provisions.  A hearing on March 8, 2019 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Department of Homeland Security, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Utah Office of the Chief of the Market Abuse Unit (OBIU) in its investigation of the subject matter of this matter."
