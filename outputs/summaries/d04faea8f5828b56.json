  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against a Boston man accused of orchestrating a double-murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that, on January 31, 2005, a jury found Manolo Salazar guilty of first-degree murder in the first degree on the basis of his intoxication.  According to the complaint, the jury was presented with evidence that the defendant had spent at least four and one-half hours drinking beer with the victim on the day of the murder, although he did not know how many beers he had consumed. The complaint further alleges that trial counsel failed to introduce the defendant's medical records and accompanying expert testimony as part of her intoxication strategy.  In a judgment that permanently enjoins Salazar from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Salazar has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against Salazar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Boston Police Department, and the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office in this matter."
