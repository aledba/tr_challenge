  "summary": "On January 19, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio entered a final judgment against Pi In The Sky, L.L.C., a single-member limited-liability company, finding that it violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Cincinnati, Pi In the Sky, as a single member, purchased an aircraft without paying sales or use tax on it and then leased it to Mitchell's Salon and Day Spa, Inc. (\"Mitchell's\").  The court found that the aircraft was not \"engaging in business,\" as required by the federal securities laws, and that it was not engaging in business within the meaning of the sale-for-resale exception.  In addition, the court ruled that, in the nature of the business activity, a lease agreement constitutes a \"transaction for business,\" and that the lease agreement does not permit the purchase or lease of an aircraft for the purpose of leasing it to others as part of a business enterprise.  Without admitting or denying the BTA's findings, the Court found that Pi in The Sky violated Section 5 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") by failing to provide relevant citations to the record certified by the tax commissioner.  The Court also found that, as alleged in the complaint, Pi in the Sky did not purchase the aircraft for purposes of leasing, but instead used a loan to fund the purchase and lease of the aircraft.  As a result of the Court's finding, the amount of money owed to the borrower to pay the loan was insufficient to support the claim that the loan had been repaid in a timely manner, and the loan amount was insufficient for the aircraft's operation, maintenance, and storage.    In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (BTA) today announced that it has obtained a court order halting the issuance of an emergency asset freeze, freezing the assets of the two companies, and ordering them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $1,217,460. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection of Fraudulent Business Practices, with the assistance of the Ohio Department of Commerce's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. The SEC's litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by Amy Gwiazda of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office."
