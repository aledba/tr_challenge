  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Massachusetts today entered final judgments against Hanover Country Florist and its owner, Joseph and Nancy A. Leonard, for violations of the federal, state, and municipal securities laws.  The court entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the Leonards from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to return the lot to its original condition.  According to the court's order, filed on December 3, 2013, the Leonard's outdoor display of flowers and plants was not permitted prior to the 2011 amendment to the town's zoning bylaw requiring special permits for all outdoor displays. The court also ruled that the placement of the concrete barriers did not violate the bylaw, and that the building commissioner and building commissioner could not enforce the order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court also issued a cease-and-desist order and ordered the building to comply with the final judgment.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of New York today announced criminal charges against the two Leonards.  On March 24, 2019, the federal district court in Hanover, Massachusetts, entered a judgment against the defendants, ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and ordering the destruction of any evidence that may have been obtained in connection with the violations of Section 5 of the municipal securities law. The final judgment also ordered that the defendants pay civil penalties of $500,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, to be offset by disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $100,000 civil penalty from the district court.  Finally, on March 26, 2020, the Court entered a temporary restraining order against the three Leonards, freezing their assets, and barring them from participating in any type of municipal enforcement proceeding.  A hearing on March 27, 2020 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-11 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Amy C. Welshhans, Regional Director of the Boston Regional Office.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Schiffenhaus and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office."
