  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in a patent litigation action against British Telecom, Inc., a U.K.-based telecommunications company, and two in-house attorneys for British Telecom.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that British Telecom violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the complaint, British Telecom and its litigation counsel, Sean Thompson, agreed to a temporary restraining order prohibiting them from participating in post-grant administrative proceedings, including in the drafting and amending of patent claims.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  On March 6, 2019, the court granted British Telecom's request for an emergency asset freeze and other emergency relief, including an asset freeze, and granted the company's motion for a temporary asset freeze. The court's order, which is subject to court approval, prohibits the defendants from violating the anti-fraud provision of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rules 5(b)(2) and (3) thereunder, and requires the defendants to provide a copy of the proposed protective order to the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17CV183, No. 16-403, 2009 WL 16-11, 2009 (D. Del. N.Y. Dec. 21, 2014).  The complaint also alleges that the defendants violated Section 17cv-1 of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-3 thereunder and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, penny stock bars, and officer-and-director and penny stock bar against Hobbs.  Finally, the complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 17CV-1, Section 13(b), and Rule 13b2-2 thereunder of Exchange Exchange Act Rule 13a-1.   The court granted the defendants' request for emergency asset freezes and other relief, as well as an order requiring the parties to provide an accounting of the amount of money owed to the defendants, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's case is being handled by Robert Green, John Rymas, and Amy Gwiazda of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U."
