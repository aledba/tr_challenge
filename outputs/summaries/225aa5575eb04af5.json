  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment against Jason Andrew Godwin, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in the 2014 Kooskia, Idaho double-murder.  According to the SEC's complaint, on June 9, 2014, Godwin attended a barbeque with friends and family members after learning that Anderson had been shot in self-defense. The complaint alleges that Godwin was confronted by an officer who demanded that he show proof of the victim\u2019s violent or aggressive character before he fired a shot at Anderson. The officer allegedly told Godwin that Anderson was going to \u201cget rid of him\u201d and that he would \u201clet somebody else do it.\u201d The complaint further alleges that after Godwin confessed to the officer, the officer fired a gun at him, causing Anderson to drop to the ground.  The complaint charges Godwin with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Godwin.  On June 26, 2016, the U. S. District Judge for the Southern District of New York entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Godwin from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and a $10,000 officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denied the SEC\u2019S findings, the court also ordered Godwin to comply with the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge $5,000 in prejudgment interests, and imposing a $20,000 penalty. The court also issued a temporary restraining order, barring him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and requiring him to provide a copy of the final judgment to the jury. The SEC is continuing its investigation, which is continuing to be conducted by Brian Hewson and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the SEC Enforcement Division. The litigation will be led by Jason M. Braunstein. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Idaho State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
