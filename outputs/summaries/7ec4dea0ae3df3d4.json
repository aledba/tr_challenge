  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Scott Lively in a civil injunctive action brought by Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG) in 2012.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Massachusetts, alleges that Lively violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the district court improperly granted Lively's request to purge certain unflattering statements in its dispositive opinion from the court's record.  According to the complaint, Lively was the prevailing party in SMUG's case, and the court granted his request for summary judgment on all of the state-law claims without prejudice.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the complaint charges Lively with violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has issued an order suspending Lively from appearing or practicing before the Commission on the Status of Women, and ordering him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and a $10,000 officer-and-director bar.  Lively has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to comply with the Commission's order suspending him from appearing, practicing, or appearing before any federal district court for the purpose of reviewing the merits of the case. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 21, 2020).  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by David A. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Office of the Secretary of State, the FBI, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, and FINRA."
