  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio on March 28, 2018 entered a final judgment against Mark R. Dalton, Jr., a Montgomery County, Ohio man convicted of one count of gross sexual imposition (by force) in violation of R.C. 2921.05(B), a third-degree felony, and sentenced him to 24 months in prison, to be served consecutively to his sentence in Montgomery County C.P. No. 2017 CR 3384.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Dayton, Dalton was screened at the Montgomery County jail by Laurie Johnson, a screening specialist and clinician with the MonDay Community Correctional Institution, to determine if he would be eligible to participate in a MonDay program as an alternative to traditional incarceration.  The court found that Dalton violated the federal confidentiality rules by failing to disclose that he had a history of self-harm and had been rejected as a candidate by a different judge due to his comments about the victim.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Dalton.   The SEC's complaint charges Dalton with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Dalton consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and bars him from serving any prison term for five years, and orders him from participating in any offering of a penny stock.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to a $50,000 bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 29, 2018, the court entered a judgment against Dalton, finding him guilty of one of the three felony counts of retaliation, ordering him to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, and imposing a conduct-based injunction against future securities laws violations. The court also found that, in the alternative, Dalton could have waived a jury as to the type of unlawful threat of harm required by the retaliation statute.  To settle the case, Dalton agreed to a settlement where he would pay a penalty of $20,000, and a $10,000 penalty. The judgment also prohibits him from associating with any person or entity with a substance-abuse conviction."
