  "summary": "On January 26, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against Somerset Trust Company, LLC and its sole owner, Larry Mostoller, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Jersey, Mostoller and his company, Somerset Trust, raised the issue of whether a provision of the Final DIP Order required the payment of a tax refund on account of 2015 operating losses. The complaint alleges that mostoller agreed to the provision of a \"pre-petition\" financing that would provide for a refund of $2 million to $2.5 million for the Debtor, and that the amount of the refund would be determined by STC upon receipt of the tax refund.  The complaint further alleges that Mostoller was aware of the provision in the Final dIP Order, but did not participate in the drafting of the final dip order.  In addition, the Complaint alleges that Mr. Mostoller failed to disclose to STC that he had not agreed to a pre-tax refund and that he was not required to execute a power of attorney to give STC the right to determine whether a refund should be paid.  Further, as alleged in the complaint, mostoller was not aware that the final DIP order required the repayment of the 2015 operating loss, and therefore did not have the authority to do so.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC Complaint, STC and Mostoller have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering STC to pay a civil penalty of $1.2 million, and ordering Mostoller to pay disgorgement of $6,356,642, prejudgment interest of $192,768, and a civil penalties of $160,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by David L. Fuchs, Kelly L. Gibson, and Patrick J. McCluskey of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in this matter."
