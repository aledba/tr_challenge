  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against an Ethiopian citizen for defrauding the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore, Maryland, alleges that on September 6, 2002, an Immigration and Naturalization Service (USCIS) officer interviewed a United States citizen for the purpose of granting him permanent resident status. The officer allegedly told the immigrant that he had been placed in removal proceedings and that the decision to remove him from the country was based on a clerical error by USCIS. The complaint further alleges that the officer had not adjudicated or approved plaintiff's application for adjustment of status and therefore could not approve the application.  The complaint also alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, plaintiff was never actually admitted as a permanent resident of the U. States and thus was ineligible for naturalization.  In addition, the complaint alleges that after USCIS interviewed plaintiff, the agency issued a Notice of Action (Form I-589) indicating that plaintiff had filed a frivolous asylum application and that an Immigration Judge had issued an order denying his application. The agency's decision to revoke the application, which USCIS issued to plaintiff on September 21, 2011, was the sole adjudication and approval of the application by the Immigration Judge.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, USCIS has consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval. The court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court at a later date. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
