  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against defendants Chesapeake Exploration, LLC, CHK UTICA, LLC; TOTAL E & P USA, Inc.; EnerVest Operating, LLC and Pelican Energy, LLC for failing to file a valid lien on oil and gas wells.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in Carroll County Common Pleas Court on February 6, 2018, Chesapeake and its general contractor, RKJ Enterprises LLC, failed to file an affidavit for record with the court for purposes of perfecting a mechanic's lien against Appellees.  The complaint further alleges that the court improperly granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, to have the court accept and record the lien.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Chesapeake.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Jason Mavroudis, John Rymas, and Paul G. Sansone of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Sanson and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.
