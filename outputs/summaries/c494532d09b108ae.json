  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant in a child custody proceeding against Brianna M. and her half brother, Ron H.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Arizona, on June 6, 2012, Brianna and her brother, Ronnie H. (Ron) M. (Brianna), were the only children in the family home when Brianna was born.  As alleged in the complaint, the defendant falsely claimed that he was the father of the child when, in fact, he was not the father.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant failed to disclose to Brianna's mother that he had a history of domestic violence and drug use, and failed to provide her with sufficient financial support to support her child.  Finally, the court found that, as a matter of law, a voluntary declaration of paternity does not preclude a person from having a \"presumed father\" status in a dependency proceeding, and that a judgment establishing presumed father status requires a court to determine whether a person is entitled to a presumption of paternity.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  Additionally, the judge granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment against them, ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 each, and imposing a $50,000 civil penalty against each of them.  On August 2, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Ron M. Mascianica, a California resident, charging him with violating Section 15 of the Exchange Act and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Christopher M. Kasper and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry in the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Arizona Department of Children and Family Services, the Arizona State Department of Health and Human Services, and the Arizona Office of Child and Family Education."
