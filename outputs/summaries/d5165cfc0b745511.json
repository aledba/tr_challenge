  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Colorado today entered final judgments in favor of Colorado residents who are seeking to restrict the sale, purchase, and sale of large-capacity magazines (LCMs) in the wake of a mass shooting in Colorado.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, on July 1, 2013, the Colorado General Assembly passed House Bills 13-1224 (HB 1224), restricting the use of LCMs for firearms, and 13-1329 (HB 1329) expanding mandatory background checks for firearm sales and transfers.  The court found that the statutes impose an unreasonable burden on the right to keep and bear arms because they ban virtually every type of firearm, including magazines with capacities of more than fifteen rounds at one time.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against one of the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws, with the option to apply for a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Hinojos-Mendoza of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John A. Sansone and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado Secretary of State's Office."
