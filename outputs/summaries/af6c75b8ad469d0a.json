  "summary": "On January 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against Belchertown Public Schools and the Massachusetts Bureau of Special Education (BSE) in a related case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Boston, Massachusetts, on September 2, 2014, BelcherTown Public Schools, a public school operated by the School District, and the school district drafted an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) for the 2014-2015 school year. The IEPs offered to students with learning disabilities were reasonably calculated to provide them with FAPE. The complaint alleges that, consistent with the IEP, Student was not harmed by the deficient IEP and was entitled to a compensatory education award.  The complaint further alleges that Student's family placed her at a private day school in the fall of 2014, when she was found eligible to receive special education services to address a language-based learning disability.  As alleged in the complaint, Student withdrew from WMA and was placed at Curtis Blake Day School, a private, out-of-district, special education school, where she participated in an intensive integrated language based program.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Massachusetts today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained a temporary restraining order halting the litigation.  On January 13, 2020, the court entered a preliminary injunction against further violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court granted the court's motion for summary judgment and ordered the district to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the district and school district consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(c) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-2 thereunder, and ordering the District to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties of $50,000 each. The district and BSEA also agreed to pay $75,000 in civil penalties and to the issuance of an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver. The receiver will determine the amount of any restitution to be paid by the receiver and the receiver will be determined by the court at a later date. The relief sought by the complaint is pending final approval by the district"
