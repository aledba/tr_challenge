  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the Bank of America, N.A., and two other companies for defrauding investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that, in 2006, Quick Loan Funding, Inc. (\"Quick Loan\"), a San Jose, California-based real estate developer, and its owner, Nicholas Agbabiaka, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Orcillas failed to adequately allege that the trustee's sale of the property constituted a breach of the securities laws.  According to the complaint, the orcillas also failed to allege that they were in default because of the loan modification agreement, and failed to disclose to the trustee that the borrower had defaulted on the loan.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement of $688,871.94, prejudgment interest of $1,038.49, and a civil penalty of $25,000.  On May 24, 2010, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against BofA from enforcing the final judgments, which were entered on the same day that the final judgment was entered, ordering the injunction to be temporary and subject to court approval.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the Defendants for violating the securities registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and the broker-dealer registration provision of Section 15(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1. The SEC is seeking a temporary restraining order, an injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against future violations of the anti-fraud provisions. "
