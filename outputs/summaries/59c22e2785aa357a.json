  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc., a Memphis, Tennessee-based integrated capacity solutions company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on November 22, 2016, Box was employed as a director of transportation in JB Hunt's integrated capacity solution division when he resigned on October 27, 2016. The complaint alleges that the trial court improperly granted Box's motion for an injunction and a temporary restraining order and that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to enter an order granting the injunction and restraining order without prejudice. The SEC alleges that Box violated these provisions by accepting a position as a receiver for an insurance company and by acting as an unregistered broker-dealer. In addition, the complaint alleged that Box failed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of his motion for a judgment that required him to post security in an amount sufficient to pay the amount of his legal fees and attorney's fees associated with the judgment.  The SEC's order, which was entered on September 26, 2017, requires the court to determine whether a judgment should be entered without prejudice against Box. The court also has jurisdiction over certain other matters in the case.  In its order, the court found that Box had violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b2-1, 13a-2, 13b2, and 13b3-2 thereunder, and that the court lacked jurisdiction to issue a judgment without prejudice in Box I.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Box consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon, and orders Box to pay civil penalties. The judgment also prohibits Box from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, offer or sale of any security, investment, municipal securities, or investment in any company that is subject to court approval. The final judgment also requires Box to submit a written response to a court order appointing him receiver.  On March 12, 2018, Box filed a motion to strike, or, alternatively, a response in opposition to the motion for injunctive relief, which the court dismissed based on a lack of jurisdiction. In a parallel action, the SEC today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing receivership action against Box, ordering the SEC to issue an order appointing a receiver to the insurance company, and imposing a $1.5 million civil penalty."
