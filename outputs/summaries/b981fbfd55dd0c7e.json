  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered final judgments against Chronics LLC, a Washington, D.C.-based marijuana company, and its owner, Brock Marchel, in a parallel action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, Washington, alleges that in 2013, the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board (WSLCB) denied the application of a retail marijuana license to a company owned and operated by Haines-Marchel.  According to the complaint, WAC 314-55-035 (1) requires that a person or entity with a prior felony conviction apply for a license to sell or offer a medical marijuana product.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Chronics and Marchel consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In addition, the final judgment orders Chronics to comply with the requirements of the federal securities laws and orders the company to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  Additionally, the court will determine whether to issue an officer-and-director bar for Chronics based upon the conduct of its investigation.  On May 1, 2014, the WSLCB issued an order requiring all true parties of interest to qualify for a marijuana license, including spouses, to submit a written statement of interest in connection with the issuance of a license.  As set forth in the order, the SEC seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest in the purchase, sale, and operation of any marijuana-related business.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17 (2014).  The complaint also seeks a temporary restraining order, an order freezing the assets of Chronics, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the sale and purchase of marijuana in the state of Washington.  Finally, the complaint seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and the appointment of a receiver under the supervision of a federal district attorney.   In a related administrative proceeding, the federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it had obtained an emergency court order halting the sale, purchase, and offer of medical marijuana to certain individuals in violation of federal law."
