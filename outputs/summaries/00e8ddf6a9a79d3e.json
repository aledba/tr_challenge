  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arkansas today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Springdale, Arkansas, alleges that Ronald M. Monson, a former Springdale Police Department employee, provided remote access to a phone used by two victims of child sexual abuse. According to the complaint, Monson described the incidents of sexual abuse to an Arkansas State Police child investigator and to a detective. The complaint further alleges that he retrieved numerous pictures of CB from appellant's phone, including one that was posted on appellant's Facebook account. The SEC alleges that, in 2016, the Barnharts noticed that CB's attitude toward appellant had changed, and he no longer laughed at his jokes. The court also ruled that the defendant had a constitutional right not to confront a witness.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Missouri today announced criminal charges against Monson.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the SEC issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering the SEC to conduct an examination of the phone records of the two victims, which was conducted by the agency's Office of Professional and Risk Analysis. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gaunt. The Court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Arkansas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Arkansas Department of Justice in this matter."
