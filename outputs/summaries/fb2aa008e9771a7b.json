  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment against Security Financial Fund, LLC, a Kootenai County, Idaho-based real estate development company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in 2003, Brian Crumb, his wife, Frankie McFeron-Crumb, and their company, Abbey & Crumb Developments, LLC (B&C), entered into an agreement in which they would grant easements to all of the lots within the subdivision for the payment of $200,000.  According to the complaint, Crumb agreed to the agreement without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&C&R&e;s complaint, and that he would grant the easement to the lots in the subdivision.  Crumb also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Crumb.  On May 24, 2018, the court granted summary judgment to Security and ordered Crumb to comply with the court's order, ordering him to pay $75,000 in civil money, and ordering a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws.  Security has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 12-120 of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-2, and 14a-13 thereunder, and orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay a $50,000 civil penalty to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC&rsquo;s continuing investigation is being conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter in the Denver Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner, Ms. Braunstein, and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Idaho Office of Inspector General."
