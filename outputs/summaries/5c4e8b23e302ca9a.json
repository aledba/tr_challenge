  "summary": "On June 22, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia entered a final judgment against Rent-A-Center, Inc., a West Virginia-based real estate development company, and its former assistant manager, Anita Ellis, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Charleston, West Virginia, Ellis was hired as an assistant manager in March 2011 and signed an arbitration agreement in which she agreed to arbitrate issues of arbitrability.  The complaint alleges that the arbitration agreement contained a clause that required the parties to agree to arbitration, and that the delegation clause was a non-negotiable term in an adhesion contract.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Ellis consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for West Virginia today announced criminal charges against Ellis.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0instant.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint against Ellis alleges that, contrary to the representations in the Complaint, Ellis has failed to demonstrate substantive unconscionability, as she had no meaningful opportunity to seek counsel.  She has also failed to show sufficient sophistication or understanding of the arbitration provisions to determine whether she is entitled to an independent arbitrator based on her experience and qualifications.\u00c2\u00a0  The Complaint charges Ellis with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Ellis has also agreed to a settlement where she will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  This settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17."
