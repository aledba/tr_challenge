  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Bank of America, N.A., a national bank, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that, as trustees for their minor children, they opened accounts entitled to account service fees for the minor's use.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to maintain the accounts as they were and instead made withdrawals from the accounts without court approval.  As alleged, defendants' withdrawals were inconsistent with state law, and the complaint further alleges that they failed to timely supply the employer with a copy of a trustee's statement establishing the Coogan Trust Account.  In addition, defendants allegedly failed to disclose to the minor that they would open and maintain the account and instead make withdrawals from these accounts, including but not limited to monthly service charges.  Finally, the SEC alleges that defendants violated the preemption provisions of the federal securities laws, and that the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000, $2,500, and $3,500.  Additionally, the court granted the complaint's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants, as well as an officer and director bar against them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, offer and sale of any security, investment, or other financial instrument in the name of a public company, and a penny stock bar against each of the defendants.   The final judgment also orders the defendants to pay $100,000 in civil penalties, $50,000 of disgorging and prejudgment interest in the amounts of their respective accounts, and to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Marc Blau of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the California Department of Insurance, the California Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission."
