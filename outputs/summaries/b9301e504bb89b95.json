  "summary": "On June 29, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a default judgment against Mingzheng International Trading Limited (Mingzheng), a company controlled by Kim Tong Chol, for violating the anti-money laundering provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., alleges that, from at least 2013 through at least 2016, the government obtained a temporary restraining order, a cease-and-desist order, and an asset freeze.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants used front companies to facilitate transactions with North Korean financial facilitators, such as Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Company Ltd., an entity designated by the Department of Justice as a \"Defender of the United States\" for violations of the IEEPA and the federal money laundering laws.  According to the complaint, the defendants also allegedly used a front company for the Foreign Trade Bank that acted as an umbrella bank for foreign currency transactions in North Korea.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,902,975.69 plus prejudgment interest of $22,173.00, and orders the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $2,906,995.69, which is equal to the amount of their profits, and requires them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with interest.  Finally, the court granted the defendants' motion for default judgment on the basis of a finding that it satisfied both the substantive and procedural requirements of the proposed default judgment.   The court also granted the parties' request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 9 of the Exchange Act, and ordered the forfeiture proceedings to be conducted by the SEC and the Division of Enforcement, with the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  In a parallel action, the United Kingdom and Switzerland today announced parallel criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged money laundering scheme. \u00c2\u00a0The U.K. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced that it has filed a civil forfeiture action against the defendant, charging him with violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(A) and (B).  The complaint also named the defendants as relief defendants for the purpose of recovering stolen assets.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
