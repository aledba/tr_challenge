According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Kentucky, C.J. and her husband, M.S., filed a dual petition seeking to terminate the parental rights of Child\u2019s biological parents and leave to adopt Child.  The SEC alleges that C.j. and M.

The order also requires the defendants to provide a copy of the final judgment, which will be entered by the court upon motion of the court at a later date.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (Feb. 26, 2019).
