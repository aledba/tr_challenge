  "summary": "On October 26, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment against defendants D. Cefalu Management, Inc. and Christine Difiore Kirsch for failure to pay overtime compensation in accord with the Fair Labor Standards Act.  The court granted summary judgment on the motion for summary judgment against the defendants.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on September 24, 2008, the defendants agreed to pay $1989.65 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their fees and costs.  In its order, the court found that defendants were not covered by the federal securities laws and that defendants should be awarded attorney's fees based on reasonable and proper fees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay a civil monetary penalty of $1,821. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the SEC's Fort Lauderdale Regional Office, with the assistance of the Office of Compliance's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. The case has been supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by Amy Gwiazda. The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov website\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.
