  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two defendants in a medical malpractice case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that on April 1, 2008, Lucien Ouanzin sought dental treatment from Dr. Paul Baker, DDS, Coast Dental Services, Inc., a Florida-based oral surgeon, when he observed a dark discoloration in his mandible while examining the x-ray taken by Dr. Musashi.  According to the complaint, the Ouanzins then sought treatment from a specialist or oral surgeon who had previously performed a similar procedure in 2008.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, Dr. Baker failed to detect the discolored mandible and instead told the decedent that he would have had to undergo as drastic of a procedure to remove the tumor in 2011.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 24-7-702 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In its order, the SEC also ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the federal securities laws.  On May 24, 2017, the Honorable Judge Michael J. Moore of the U. S. District Judge's Office in Atlanta granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict, which is subject to court approval. The SEC\u2019s order, which was entered in a parallel administrative proceeding, prohibits the defendants from denying or denying a motion for directed verdict and orders the parties to pay civil penalties of $15,000 and $20,500, respectively, for each of those violations.  A separate administrative proceeding has been instituted against the defendants for the purpose of recovering from the alleged misconduct of the trial court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 599, 604 (1) (2) (3) (4) (2012).  In a related matter, the Court issued an order granting the defendants a directed jury trial on May 25, 2017."
