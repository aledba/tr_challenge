  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Southern California Edison Co. (\"Edison\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orange County, California on May 6, 2011, Wilson and her husband, Jason Stelle, raised the issue of stray voltage in their home.  The complaint alleges that Edison failed to disclose to the jury that there was a problem with stray voltage at Wilson\u2019s house, and that Edison had failed to detect or remediate the problem.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Wilson failed to show sufficient evidence to support her claim for a civil injunctive action against Edison, and failed to provide any reasonable explanation for why she refused to move out of the house.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Wilson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to pay a civil penalty of $1.2 million, and orders Wilson to pay attorney fees in the amount of $3 million.  On the same day, the court granted Wilson's motion for a retrial on the nuisance claim, which is subject to court approval, and granted her the right to reapply for a hearing in the future on the same matter.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the California Office of Inspector General. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.
