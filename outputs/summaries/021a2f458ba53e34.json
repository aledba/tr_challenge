  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee today entered a final judgment in favor of Clarksville, Tennessee, against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for failing to provide sufficient jurisdiction over the transportation and sale of natural gas in interstate commerce.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee on June 26, 2013, the SEC alleges that Tennessee-based natural gas company Clarksville Inc. violated Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act of 1940 by failing to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity from FERC prior to \"undertak[ing] the construction or extension\" of any natural gas facility for the transportation of gas to Guthrie, Kentucky.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to the Commission's findings, Clarksville has not suffered any hardship in violation of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Clarksville.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Commission has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 7 of the NGA, and ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit, and is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Eric R. Werner. The case is supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Tennessee Department of Natural Resources, and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to be aware of the risks of investing in an investment in a public gas company."
