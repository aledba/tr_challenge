  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against a former custodian at the Postal Service for his role in an alleged battery-related incident.  According to the SEC's complaint, on September 13, 2017, Ronald Cain of Kilmarnock, Va., parked his truck near a pickup truck owned and controlled by Cain.  The complaint alleges that Cain had backed his truck into its parking space so that the truck's horn or alarm faced the parking lot.  As alleged in the complaint, Cain caused the horn to sound a second time while he stood in close proximity to the truck.  In a parallel action, on May 21, 2019, the United States District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, entered final judgments against Cain for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and for aiding and abetting Cain's violations of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 12(b)(6) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the judgment, Cain consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $3 million, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and from participating in any officer-and-director or director-training program for at least five years.  He also agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal bond dealer, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Andrew J. Billups, III. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia Department of Insurance, and the Virginia Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
