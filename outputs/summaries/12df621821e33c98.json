  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in favor of defendants Arvin Carmen, Karlynn Tones, and Donta Blackmon.  The court granted the defendants' requests for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and other relief.  According to the court's order, the defendants were among sixty-two individuals charged with participating in a large conspiracy to smuggle oxycodone pills from Los Angeles for distribution in Spokane, Washington.  In its order granting the defendants temporary restraining orders, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder, and ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, Carmen and Tones consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and from participating in any future conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance.  Tones agreed to settle the case by consenting to a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating these provisions, and orders her to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Blackmon also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to a five-year bar from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On the other hand, Tones has agreed to a six-year suspension from appearing, practicing, or practicing any legal profession.  He also agreed not to participate in a continuing criminal enterprise.  For further information, see United States v. Kelly, 527 F.3d 1349, 1149 (9th Cir. 2013).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges the defendants with violating Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(3) of Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against the defendants.  To learn more about penny stock bars, see Securities Litigation Release No. 17 (Sept. 5, 2009).  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Carmen.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 10, 2014.   The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry, Chief of the SEC's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
