  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in an emergency action related to the Chemical Disaster Rule.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Sections 7607(d)(7)(B) and 7606(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act.  According to the complaint, the delay rule is intended to prevent accidental releases of highly dangerous chemicals, such as lead-acid batteries, from causing serious harm to workers, local communities, and the environment.  For example, the complaint alleges that, in promulgating the Delay Rule, EPA delayed the effective date of a final chemical disaster rule by three months.  In a parallel action, on June 14, 2017, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in New York, alleging that, contrary to the SEC\u2019s findings, EPA improperly delayed the date of the final rule by more than three months, even though it knew that the timing of the delay was not unreasonable.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the court also ordered the agency to provide a reasoned explanation for why the delay should not be imposed on the affected parties.  Specifically, the Court found that, by delaying the delay, EPA violated Section 7607, and that it violated Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder of the federal securities laws, Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 12b-20 thereunder. The court also found that the delay is unreasonable because it is necessary to preserve the safety and effectiveness of the proposed rule.  Further, the case was investigated by the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, which conducted an examination of the safety, effectiveness, and record-keeping capabilities of the agency. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the United States Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service, and other emergency relief agencies. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of people selling or selling investments in\u00c2\u00a0the companies\u00c2\u00a0that invest\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor\u00c2\u00a0instituting\u00c2\u00a0safe and effective and risk-based practices\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0practicing\u00c2\u00a0with\u00c2\u00a0"
