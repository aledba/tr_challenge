  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wyoming today entered final judgments against a Wyoming company and its former CEO in a workers' compensation case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, alleges that, on January 16, 2014, Jody J. Sweetalla injured his shoulder while attempting to open a garage door while working for Legend Services, Inc. (Legend Services). According to the complaint, Sweetalla immediately notified his employer of the injury and sought medical care the same day. The complaint further alleges that shortly after he filed his injury report with the Division, he was told that his injury was not compensable because he did not file a claim for benefits within one year of the date he injured himself.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the Division repeatedly confused an injury report and claimed that it had reviewed the injury report when it did not, and did not inform Sweetalla of the fact that the statute of limitations had not yet lapsed.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services, and the Wyoming State Corporation Commission in this matter."
