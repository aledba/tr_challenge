  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada today entered a settlement in a civil rights case involving excessive force and denial of medical care.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Las Vegas, Nevada, Daniel Vargas, then 16 years old, claimed that a federal district court improperly imposed a $99,999 fee reduction on his behalf.  The complaint alleges that the court improperly reduced the amount of attorney\u2019s fees that Vargas requested based on the number of hours that he spent preparing a reply brief for his client.  As alleged in the complaint, Vargas also sought a 90 percent reduction in fees for work performed by two other attorneys, Gentile Cristalli Miller Armeni Savarese, and Colleen McCarty.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it improperly imposed the fees on Vargas.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount they will be entitled to.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Stephen J. Ware and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Nevada Department of Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Nevada Office of Inspector General."
