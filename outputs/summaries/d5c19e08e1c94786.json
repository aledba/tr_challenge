The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that Nicole Capps, a mother of three, and her husband, R.W. Jr., engaged in a pattern of physical abuse in the home.  According to the complaint, from approximately June 24, 2017 through September 30, 2017, mother and husband allegedly engaged in an aggressive and aggressive conduct that resulted in the children's death.  In addition, the complaint alleges that mother repeatedly kicked and kicked the children in the face and body, causing them to cry, and leaving the children alone in the living room.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the children were in the care of mother's boyfriend, who had been previously incarcerated for similar conduct.  When mother confronted her boyfriend about his conduct, he allegedly told her that he had done \"enough\" to cause the child's death and that he would \"take a hard whooping.\"  The complaint further alleges that after mother and her boyfriend left the children with their mother, she continued to kick and kick the children, causing the children to cry and lose consciousness.  On September 5, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against mother, charging her with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Capps consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Capps also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing scheduled for October 17, 2018 will be held on the matter of whether or not to proceed with a hearing on the subject of termination of parental rights.
