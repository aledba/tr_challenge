  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a Mexican company and its then-Director General for violating the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1940.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 28, 2013, the Mexican company Exportadora de Sal, S.A. de C.V., entered into a long-term, multi-million dollar contract with another Mexican company, Packsys, to sell residual brine from its process of producing sea salt. As alleged in the complaint, however, the contract was not executed with actual authority, and Packsys did not have the requisite authority to enter the contract. Instead, the complaint alleges that Packsys entered the contract on the basis of a hunch that the board had approved the contract without having any authority to execute it. As the complaint further alleges, the board never issued the contract, and no board resolution authorizing the contract ever issued it. The SEC's final judgment, which permanently enjoins Packsys from violating Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, orders Packsys to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. Packsys has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mexican Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mexican Ministry of Justice in this matter."
