  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Great Oaks Water Co., a San Jose, Calif.-based water treatment company, on the basis of its receipt of a $1.45 million civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on March 1, 2005, the Santa Clara Valley Water District was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Great Oaks failed to comply with certain of the requirements of the federal securities laws, including the right to collect and use water from wells, and failed to provide timely and accurate information about the impact of the charge on the district's water supply.  In addition, the complaint alleged that the District failed to adequately disclose to the court that the charge was a property-related charge and that it was exempt from the registration requirements.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Great Oaks consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $1,306,830, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the matter.  Great Oaks also agreed to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any water-related property in the District, and to pay an officer and director bar and an officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the San Francisco Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Water Resources, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
