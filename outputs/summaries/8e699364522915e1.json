  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former Sand Ridge employee for his role in a recent sexual violence case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 2007, when Stephenson was fifteen years old, he was charged with two counts of second-degree sexual assault of a child and one count of third-degree criminal sexual assault.  According to the complaint, Stephenson had struggled when placed on supervision for his criminal offenses, committing new offenses and obtaining \"multiple revocations.\"  The complaint further alleges that Stephenson had repeatedly covered his room's window with a towel and attempted to order women's \"Satan thong underwear\" when confronted by staff at Sand Ridge.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2016 Stephenson had agreed to a judgment that he was more likely than not to commit a future act of sexual violence.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Stephenson consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, a $50,000 officer-and-director bar, and a $100,000 bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael Kienitz and supervised by Jennifer Chun Barry of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Wisconsin Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
