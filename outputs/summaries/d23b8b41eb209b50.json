  "summary": "The U.S. Department of Labor today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing administrative proceeding against a coal mine operator accused of misappropriating millions of dollars of investor funds.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of Columbia, alleges that, on November 12, 2015, Arch Coal, Inc. (\"Arch\"), filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (\"District Court\"), alleging that the company violated the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") by failing to disclose that it was potentially liable for certain of the company's claims.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that Arch violated the federal securities laws when it issued a Bulletin in May 2015 that included an exemption from district court jurisdiction.  In its complaint, Arch alleged that the Bulletin violated the reporting provisions of the federal law, and that it failed to adequately consider the relevant requirements of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Arch consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
