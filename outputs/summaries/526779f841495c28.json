  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for the purpose of recovering stolen property.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that, on the night of 27 September 2014, Ricky Jones and his cousin, Anthony Austin, engaged in an argument over whether Ricky had given Anthony fake money. According to the complaint, Ricky told the defendants that he had a long clip attached to the gun and that the gun was hidden under the mattress. The complaint further alleges that Ricky and Robert Earl Jones, Ricky's uncle, both of whom were present at the time of the alleged shooting, agreed to go to the police station to give a statement, but did not follow through with their plea for a guilty verdict. Instead, Ricky allegedly fired his own gun in the air several times and then shot and killed Anthony. The SEC alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and the reporting provisions of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties. The defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Ricky Jones.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendant, charging him with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The jury deliberated for nearly two hours before finding him guilty of the same felony. The final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins the defendant from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions, and orders him to return to the United States and pay a $2,000 civil penalty. The court also ordered the defendant to surrender his passport and to surrender to the authorities.  A hearing for the defendant is scheduled for June 5, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 598 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Joseph C. Sansone, and Amy S. Cotter of the Atlanta Regional Office."
