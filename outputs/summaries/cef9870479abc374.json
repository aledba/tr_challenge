  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against Lowe's Home Centers, LLC and its attorney, Michael S. MaRous, for violating the due process provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Minneapolis, alleges that, on January 2, 2015, the tax court in Hennepin County, Minnesota, rejected two of the experts\u2019 recommendations for a value determination based on the value of the subject property.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, in a parallel action, the court found that the property was worth $11,775,000 when, in fact, it was worth less than $10,507,000.  In its final judgment, which also imposed a $2.5 million civil penalty against the property, the Court found that it had improperly overvalued the property and improperly applied adjustments to the comparable properties considered under both approaches.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Tax Court has agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $7,658,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a $1,000 civil penalty.  It also ordered the court to determine whether it had sufficient evidence in the record to determine the true value of a real estate transaction.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-2043 (Minn. 1997).  The complaint also alleges that the court improperly relied on the testimony of two appraisers for its valuation determination for the same property, and that it improperly applied additional weight to the sales approach and to the cost approach in determining market value.  Finally, the complaint alleges that in a related case, the same appraiser testified that he had been wrongfully prejudiced in his decision to adopt the cost-based valuation method because he did not explain how a well-performing property in a good retail location had experienced the level of functional obsolescence he described.   The court also found that, despite representations to the contrary, the property had not experienced any significant external or internal deprivations, and therefore, did not have sufficient evidence to justify its decision to impose the additional $2,645,000 of civil penalties against the appraiser.  Further, the case was investigated by the Minnesota Office of Economic and Risk Analysis, which issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0investor"
