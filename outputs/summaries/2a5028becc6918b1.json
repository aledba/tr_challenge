  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment in favor of the Guilford County Board of Elections (BOE) finding that Janelle Robinson, a Summerfield, North Carolina resident, was not qualified to vote in the Town of Summerfield.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Charlotte, Robinson raised the issue of whether the BOE Order violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Robinson failed to rebut Robinson\u2019s assertion that he resided at the Summerfield property without receiving any evidence from the NCREC.  Robinson also allegedly failed to corroborate his own claim that he had moved to Summerfield and that he intended to return there permanently.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for North Carolina announced criminal charges against Robinson.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of South sentenced Robinson to a five-year prison term and ordered her to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Robinson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future. The court also granted Robinson a temporary restraining order and an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations, with litigation to be led by Mr. and Ms. Robinson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the North Carolina Secretary of State's Office, the FBI, and the FBI in this matter."
