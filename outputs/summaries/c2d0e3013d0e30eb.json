  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Idaho today entered a final judgment in favor of the Idaho Mining Rights Association (\"ICL\") against Shannon Poe, who has agreed to settle the SEC's charges against her.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Idaho, alleges that Mr. Poe violated the antifraud provisions of Section 301 of the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) by failing to obtain an NPDES permit while dredging and discharging sediment and other pollutants to rivers and streams in the Clearwater River watershed.  According to the complaint, in 2014, 2015, and 2018, Poe dredged on the South Fork Clearwater and discharged sediment and/or other pollutants into the river.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2016 and 2017, Poe failed to obtain a permit to suction dredge in the river without a valid CWA permit, and that he continued to dredge on the river even after the CWA issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting him from doing so.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Poe consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 301, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and imposes an officer-and-director bar on Poe.  Poe also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay disgorgement of $2,500 plus prejudgment interest of $100, and a $10,000 civil penalty.  On August 16, 2018, the court granted the Commission's motion for a preliminary injunction against Poe and ordered Poe to comply with the court's order.  To learn more about dredging in the open, see Press Release No. 17-20 (January 24, 2018).  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Scott A. Basinger. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Idaho Department of Fish and Wildlife, and the Idaho Office of Environmental Education and Advocacy (OIEA)."
