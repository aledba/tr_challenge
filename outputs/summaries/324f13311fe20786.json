  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona today entered a final judgment against ICENY USA, LLC, M&M's, Inc., and Gabriel Eugene Pico, alleging that they violated the registration provisions of the Franchise Agreement.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Yuma, Arizona on September 6, 2019, alleges that, as a result of the termination of the franchisor agreement, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the complaint also alleges that the defendants failed to comply with the pre-termination obligations of the franchise agreement, and that, instead of continuing to use the I-CE-NY mark and its components, they continued to sell Thai ice cream rolls in the Shop.  In a parallel action, on October 1, 2020, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the registration provision and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $2,500. The final judgment also orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $500,000 and $1,500, respectively, to be determined by the court at a later date.  On October 2, 2020 the court entered a preliminary injunction against the Defendants, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief, and ordering the companies to pay a $15,000 civil penalty. The court also ordered the company to pay an $8,500 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000, which is equal to the amount that the company has already paid to the receiver of the complaint.   The court's order also prohibits the defendants from participating in the promotion, operation, promotion, or promotion of any type of food, beverage, or entertainment product, including the promotion of \"lick me, I'm yours\" on social media, and from using the company's website and social media to promote or promote the products or services of another company.
