  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against a California Highway Patrol sergeant who was permanently disabled by a single work-related injury.  The court found that Andrew Hernandez was entitled to a leave of absence without loss of salary, in lieu of disability payments, for a period not to exceed one year.  In a February 2013 decision a workers' compensation administrative law judge found Hernandez to be entitled to temporary disability/4800 time payments under section 4800. The court also found that the amount of compensation he received was insufficient to cover the full amount of his salary.  According to the court's order, Hernandez was temporarily disabled during the disputed time period and received payments equal to the amount he should have received.  As alleged in the court order, however, that Hernandez was not entitled to the relief he sought because he was temporarily incapacitated and would need future medical treatment for his low back and cervical spine.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, Hernandez consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the provisions of the federal law and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $881.56 per week, less 15% attorney's fees.  On May 1, 2015, the court held the City of Santa Monica, California, and the State Compensation Insurance Fund violated Sections 4850 and 3751 and ordered the payment of additional compensation under those provisions to be determined by the court at a later date.   The Court also ruled that, in a parallel action, the California Department of Human Resources violated Section 5 of the Workers' Compensation Act by failing to provide a reasonable explanation for why it had not previously issued a finding finding that it was unreasonable to award additional compensation to Hernandez.  Additionally, the Court found that, as a matter of law, the City violated Section 4850, and that it had exclusive jurisdiction over the payment under section 5300. The Court further ruled in favor of the City, which was not subject to the Board's jurisdiction, that there was no basis for the Commission to determine whether to impose a penalty for unreasonable delay pursuant to section 4850. The Commission also ruled against the City in a separate administrative proceeding that was conducted by a member of the Commission's Audit Committee.  Finally, the Commission agreed that the payment for the period July 18, 2011 through November 8, 2011 constituted a \"loss of salary\" in violation of Section 5300 and that there is no basis to award an additional penalty for overpayment of the required compensation under that provision.  It further ruled that Hernandez had received a portion of the payment he received upon his retirement, not the amount that he received during his temporary disability. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Health and Human Services"
