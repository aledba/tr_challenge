  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of second degree murder and life sentence at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that on July 25, 2012, at approximately 3:45 p.m., the defendant shot and killed his fiancee, Raolatu Alowonle, in front of her eight-year-old son, J.B. At trial, the defendant allegedly told the victim he was going to kill her and ordered her to retrieve a second gun. The defendant allegedly claimed, however, that the victim held the gun in her hand and pointed it in his face before he took it from her. The complaint further alleges that the defendant demanded the victim put the gun down and pointed the gun at the defendant, who then ran away. According to the complaint, the victim and her son ran out of the apartment and hid in the back of a car. The SEC alleges the defendant and the victim were confronted by a group of people who were gathered around the victim's body. The court found the defendant liable for the death of the victim, and ordered him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Livous consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment also orders Livous to pay disgorgement of $2,038,078 plus prejudgment interest in the amount of $9,829, and a civil penalty of $1 million. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against Livous. The case has been investigated by the Office of the United States Attorney's Assistant Chief of the Division of Criminal Justice, and the case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Police Department, the Louisiana State Attorney General's Office, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, the British Columbia Securities Commission, the Canadian Securities Inspection Service, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority and the Swiss Criminal Intelligence Surveillance Authority."
