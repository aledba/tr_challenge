  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire today entered a final judgment against two individuals who have agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, alleges that the New Hampshire legislature violated the federal securities laws by failing to provide sufficient information to determine whether an unmarried parent can adopt a minor child.  According to the complaint, M.F. and C.N., who live together and share two biological children, are eligible to jointly adopt J.W. as a result of the provision of Section 170-B:4, which provides for the issuance of a joint adoption decree.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, under the current statutory scheme, a parent who consents to the adoption of a child with the consent of the child's birth mother is eligible to adopt the child as a sole petitioner.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4), and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar.   The court also granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and barring them from further association with any person or entity with which they may have an interest in adopting.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Robert A. Hannan of the United States District Court in Portsmouth entered a judgment against the defendants in a civil action brought by the SEC against them.  Hannan also agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 5 of the securities laws, ordering him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Hanauer agreed to settle the case against him by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, sale, or promotion of any securities in the future. The court granted the motion against Hannan and Hannan, and ordered Hannan to comply with the court's order. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5, No. 206-1, and Rules 206-2, 206-3, 206 (2014) and 206-4, 206(2016).
