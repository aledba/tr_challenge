  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the estate of a New Jersey resident who allegedly failed to timely file an estate tax return.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, alleges that on or about March 10, 2013, the Estate of Agnes R. Skeba, Jr. filed an IRS Form 4768, which was prepared by George White of Hoagland Longo Moran Dunst & Doukas, LLP. The IRS determined that the estate had limited liquid assets at the time it filed its tax return, and that it was negotiating a mortgage on a substantial commercial property to satisfy the remainder of the estate tax owed to the federal government.  According to the complaint, the estate was unable to file the return on time due to the litigation.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey announced criminal charges against White.  On June 24, 2014, the Honorable Judge Frank M. Ciuffani granted the Estate's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting exemption.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, White consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $450,959.00. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.  Separately, the SEC filed an emergency action against White, charging him with violations of Section 6 of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  A hearing on the matter has been scheduled for July 22, 2019, for which a hearing will be scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David Lauer and Virginia Keenan of the Philadelphia Regional Office, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Klotz and Ms. Keenan."
