  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered final judgments against Fresno County and Friant Ranch, L.P., in an emergency action brought by the California Department of Water Resources.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fresno, California, alleges that Fresno County violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the District Attorney's Office for Fresno County filed a complaint in federal district court in the Central Valley on February 1, 2011, charging Fresno County with failing to adequately record the progress of its wastewater treatment plant and related projects.  In its complaint, Fresno County also alleged that the county failed to adequately account for the amount and location of treated effluent that would be generated by the treatment plant, the amount of land used for agriculture irrigation, and the use of that effluent.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to those imposed by the court.  On February 2, 2013, the court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, entered an emergency court order, and entered a final judgment ordering the defendants to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, imposing civil penalties, and imposing an officer-and-director bar.  A hearing for the defendants was scheduled for March 21, 2013.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-11. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Office of Inspector General, the Fresno County Office of Environmental Quality, and other emergency relief."
