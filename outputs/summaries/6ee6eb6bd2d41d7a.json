  "summary": "On July 6, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a Smyrna, Georgia-based provider of Medicare billing services.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, Dr. Miguel \"Miguel\" Stubbs, a primary care physician, received a letter from CMS informing him that he would be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that Stubbs has not sustained his burden of showing irreparable injury because he has not submitted any claims for payment for services rendered to deceased beneficiaries. In addition, Stubbs alleges that the letter stated that the revocation was for the same reasons as before, and that the total amount billed for the claims was approximately $1,000, and not one of the claimed claims was actually paid by Medicare.  The complaint further alleges that, based on his billing errors, the revocation is constitutionally inadequate because it will prevent him from ever being able to seek meaningful relief through the administrative appeals process.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Stubbs.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Attorney General's Office has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint Bulletin\u00c2\u00a0on the subject matter of this matter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Georgia Secretary of State's Office.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5310189 (Aug. 1, 2013).  The SEC's Complaint Bulletin also issued an Investor Alert about potential violations of the federal securities laws.  Investors can quickly and easily check whether they are eligible to redeem their investment by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0finder.gov website to quickly identify whether their investment has been deemed sufficient to warrant the issuance of a preliminary injunction. \u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action on June 19, 2013, seeking a temporary restraining order, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar.  This action is subject to court approval.  Among other things, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. "
