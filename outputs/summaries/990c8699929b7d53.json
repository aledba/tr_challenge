  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Nebraska today entered a final judgment against a former sheriff of Furnas County, Nebraska, for failing to comply with a court order requiring him to provide records to a public record custodian.  According to the court's order, on September 23, 2018, Sheriff Kurt Kapperman sent a letter to the sheriff stating that he had received a subpoena from a private entity requesting records related to the investigation of charges against him, criminal history records of jurors who had convicted him, and records for certain jurors from his trial that he asserted had been \"convicted [of] or cited for DWI.\"  The court found that the sheriff had a duty to fulfill the requested records and, therefore, required the sheriff to provide them to Huff.  In its order, the court also granted the sheriff the right to respond to the subpoena without admitting or denying the sheriff\u2019s request for records.  The order also prohibits the sheriff from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in the purchase or sale of any records, and prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, offer and sell of any security or other security that may be required of a custodian of a requested record.    In a parallel action, on January 30, 2019, a federal district court in Nebraska granted a writ of mandamus to Huff, ordering him to produce and maintain records in the possession of a public body, regardless of whether the custodian had a clear duty to perform the duties.  On February 14, 2019 the court granted the subpoena to Huff and ordered him to submit a response that satisfied the court order.  As set forth in the order, Huff did not respond, and the court did not grant the subpoena until after Huff had submitted his response.  Instead, it issued a temporary restraining order preventing Huff from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and issued an order requiring that he comply with the subpoena provisions of Sections 84-712(3)(f) and (4) with the issuance of a copy of the subpoena.  It also ordered that Huff submit a written response in which he acknowledges that he has been denied access to the records requested by the sheriff pursuant to the public records statutes and that he is entitled to a deposit of $750.00 before fulfilling such a request.  Additionally, it ordered Huff to submit an affidavit stating that, contrary to the representations in the subpoena, he had not responded to any requests for records and that, in fact, he has failed to provide the records to any custodian in the custody of another agency.  Finally, the order denied Huff's request for mandamus because,"
