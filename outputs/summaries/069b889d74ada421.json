  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on January 20, 2018, entered a final judgment against Texas-based company Lone Star Silicon Innovations LLC in a patent infringement case.  The court found that Lone Star violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, Lone Star failed to show that it had any substantial rights in the asserted patents and therefore could not sue for infringement in its own name.  In addition, the court ruled that, as alleged in the complaint, the company did not have the right to sue for patent infringement because it lacked substantial rights.  Lone Star's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that, in violation of Section 281 of the federal patent laws, it was not entitled to a share of any revenue Lone Star generated from sales of the patents, and thus could not be joined as a party to a settled action.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint or its findings, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating Section 281, and order them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, which Lone Star will pay in a civil penalty of $100,000.  Additionally, the final judgment requires the court to consider whether a party can be joined in a lawsuit without violating Section 10b of the Exchange Act.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 582 F.3d at 1344. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Patent Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Pinterest.gov.
