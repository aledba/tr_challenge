  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment in favor of Beck, who was convicted of first-degree statutory sodomy and one count of second-degree child molestation.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Missouri, Beck was the biological father of A.O., a child who was the daughter of a Jackson County Sheriff's Department employee who had been sexually abused by her brother.  The complaint alleges that, while Beck was incarcerated, he allegedly engaged in oral sodomy with the victim while she was sleeping in her sister\u2019s room.  As alleged in the complaint, Beck told the victim that, during the course of her testimony, he placed his penis in her mouth and told her to \u201csuck it like a lollipop.\u201d  He also allegedly told her that, after he was released from prison, he would do just about anything to enable her to have sex with him.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Beck, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Beck has also agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Beck has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in any future offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock in the securities industry.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans granted Beck's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to surrender his passport.  A hearing on June 5, 2019, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rycraw of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Kasper of the Atlanta Regional Office. The examination was conducted in the absence of an attorney."
