Davis consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the motion, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.

The court also granted Davis the right to a hearing in which he will be sentenced based on the facts of the case, without requiring him to show cause or consent to the appointment of a new lawyer, and with respect to his prior conviction for the same conduct alleged in the complaint.
