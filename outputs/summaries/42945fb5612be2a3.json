  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against a New York City man charged with two counts of predatory sexual assault against a minor under New York state law.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan on December 6, 2016, Michael Gumaer was arrested and charged on December 29, 2016. The complaint alleges that the federal government obtained a copy of the complaint and obtained a writ of habeas corpus from a federal magistrate judge, which required the unsealing of the federal criminal complaint and the appointment of a federal public defender. The SEC also requested that the SEC file a complaint against Gumaers with prejudice based upon the fact that he had not yet agreed to a plea agreement with the federal authorities and had already waived his Fifth Amendment right to counsel.  The complaint also alleges that, in a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced that it was unsealing an indictment against Gumumaer on all eight counts of child pornography related to his alleged role in the alleged scheme.

The judge also ordered the attorney to provide an overview of the case and provide an example of how to proceed with a case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Gumaner consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the First and Second Amendments, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his legal fees.  Gumager also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $25,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Robert Lyons and supervised by"
