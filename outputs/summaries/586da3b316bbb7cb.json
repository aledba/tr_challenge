  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment in favor of the Gaineses, who reside at 2410 West Avenue in Norfolk, Virginia.  According to the SEC's complaint, on February 7, 2017, a code enforcement official for the City of Norfolk issued a notice of violation after determining that the property was unfit for human habitation for the lack of a functioning heating system.  The complaint alleges that the complaint was filed in violation of Sections 105, 202, 603.1, and 605.1 of the Virginia Building Code, and that the Commission improperly interpreted those provisions to permit the property to be placed as uninhabitable.  Without admitting or denying the Commission\u2019s findings, Defendants agreed to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating these provisions.  Defendants also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 6(d) of the federal securities laws.  In addition, Defendants consented to the issuance of a second judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgment of $1,038, which amounts to a civil monetary penalty equal to the amount of their disgorging profits.  On October 12, 2018, the court granted the Commission's request for an emergency asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, and issued an order suspending the Commission from issuing or enforcing any order or order requiring the Commission to issue an order imposing an asset freeze or other emergency order.   The Commission's order also prohibits Defendants from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in the sale or purchase of a property, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in connection with any such security deposit.  Additionally, the Commission is prohibited from imposing any monetary penalty on a person or entity that is found to be liable for a violation of Section 5(b) or a related provision of the Federal Housing Finance Agency's (FHA) Rules of Practice, including Section 10(b)(5) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  It also prohibits defendants from acting in concert with the Commission on Inspection and Detection of Fraudulent Businesses, including those that are not registered as broker-dealers.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-63-540 (2014).  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney General's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Defendants."
