  "summary": "On April 4, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Ohio entered a final judgment against a defendant who was previously convicted for engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, breaking and entering, aggravated robbery, failure to comply with an order or signal of a police officer, and receiving stolen property.  According to the court's order, filed on May 17, 2017 in Cuyahoga County District Court, Ohio, the defendant was charged in a series of ATM \"smash and grab\" cases for his involvement in the string of ATM thefts.  The court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  In its judgment, the court also ordered that the defendant be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the securities.  On May 24, 2018, the Ohio Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order against the defendants and ordered them to surrender their allegedly stolen ATM cards and deposit the proceeds into escrow. The court also issued an order requiring the defendants to provide an accounting of the ATM thefts that occurred during the course of the alleged scheme. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and Glenn S. Gordon of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Timothy J. Burt and supervised by Amy C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban. The Court appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
