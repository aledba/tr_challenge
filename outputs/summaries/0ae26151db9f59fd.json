  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant for aiding and abetting more broadly than federal law because it merely requires knowledge, whereas federal law requires a mens rea of specific intent; and (3) accomplice and principal liability are indivisible under Washington law.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Kenneth Randale Door, who was convicted in 2014 of second-degree assault and felony harassment, violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that Door's prior felony harassment conviction did not qualify as a crime of violence pursuant to the federal statute of limitations, and that Door had a prior conviction for a similar felony harassment in violation of the same federal statute. The court also ruled that Door could have been convicted on the basis of his prior convictions for a different felony, but that Door was not entitled to a base offense level of 24, as required by the federal law. In addition, the court held that Door did not have a prior felony conviction for third-degree harassment that qualifies as a \"crime of violence,\" and that he was not liable to a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Door for his role in a similar conduct. The SEC also announced related civil injunctions against Door.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced related criminal charges.  On May 9, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Door, charging him with violating the antiterrorism provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and (2)(b)(2) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10 of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b2-1 and (4) thereunder, and against Door in a related administrative proceeding.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Door consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged federal statutes, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter, including the Office of Inspector General, Criminal Investigations, and the FBI."
