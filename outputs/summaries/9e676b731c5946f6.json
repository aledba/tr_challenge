  "summary": "On June 7, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a final judgment against the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., alleges that, since 2002, the SEC has violated the First Amendment by failing to enforce its \"no-deny\" provisions in its consent judgments in civil or administrative proceedings.  For example, the complaint alleges that in 2018, when a local restaurant was threatened with sanctions and cancelled its advertising contract with the Pitt News, the newspaper lost approximately $17,000 in revenue.  According to the complaint, this loss affected the length of the newspaper's business and the amount of advertising revenue it received.  In a parallel action, on May 24, 2020, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Kerstetter of the Court of Appeals for the Southern District of New York granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  On June 6, 2019 the Hon. Judge Kimba L. Gibson of the United States District Court in New York issued an order requiring the SEC to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amounts of their profits. The SEC also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which would be offset by a $50,000 civil penalty and a $75,000 officer and director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  An SEC complaint filed in the same case charges the SEC with violating the First and Second Amendment provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint also charges the Commission with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(1) and 13(b)(2) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rules 5a-5, 5c-8, and 16a-11 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction from future violations. The Commission has agreed to a settlement that would require the Commission to disgorge its alleged financial losses, and the SEC will pay a $25,000 penalty. The court also granted the Commission"
