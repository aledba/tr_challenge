  "summary": "On August 11, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against James Fowler, a California man accused of domestic violence, in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, James filed a motion to terminate the temporary protection order on behalf of himself and his then wife Marta Fowler in 2003.  The complaint alleges that the court improperly relied on Marta\u2019s refusal to comply with the order, and failed to consider the fact that James had not completed state-certified domestic violence treatment since entry of the order.  In its order, the court found that James was unlikely to violate the permanent protection order and that he had a reasonable fear of reoffending.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, James consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  James also agreed to be barred from associating with anyone with a history of violence, including his own criminal history, and to be prohibited from having any contact with children under the age of 12.  On August 13, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action against James, charging him with violating Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder, and with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Section 13(a)(1) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 12a-1, and 13a-13 thereunder; and with aiding and abetting James\u2019 violations of Section 5(b).  The SEC seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars against James and Marta, as well as injunctive relief against each of them.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 26.50.130(3)(a).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against James for his role in the alleged domestic violence.    The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, John R. Rymas, and Amy C. Welshhans of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. "
