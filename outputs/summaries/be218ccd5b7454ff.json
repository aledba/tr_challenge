  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against Randall Shields, a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for two counts of child molesting as level 1 felonies and strangulation as a level 6 felony.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis, Shields, who was convicted in August 2017 of the same charges as previously charged, repeatedly violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that Shields violated the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and that he violated Section 15(b)(5) and 15(a)(2) of Securities Exchange Act Section 15b-3 and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and that, as a result of his conduct, Shields was deprived of a fair trial.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Shields consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Shields arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Shoun and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Indiana State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
