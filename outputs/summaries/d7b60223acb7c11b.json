  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the Sacramento Police Department and three officers for misconduct in connection with a citizen's complaint about three officers who allegedly took biological samples from him following his arrest in December 2003.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, California on July 3, 2014, Harald Mark Galzinski, a resident of Redwood Coast Watersheds Alliance, California, complained that three officers in the department's internal affairs division did not investigate his complaint and did not render a finding on the basis of the complaint.  The complaint further alleges that Galzinski's complaint was filed without a warrant or reasonable basis and that the department did not follow its own internal policies and procedures.  Galzinski also alleged that the officers he named in his complaint committed acts of misconduct by doing what he alleged they did\u2014nothing more and nothing less.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Galzinski consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Galzinski.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Department of Justice in this matter."
