  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Robert Scheiblich, a convicted felon in possession of a revolver, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, on October 12, 2018, the Court held that, for the purposes of determining the base offense of a felony, a defendant should be held liable for a penalty equal to or greater than the amount of his sentence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Scheiblach.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court held that the defendant had violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose that he had been zip-tied at least three times during the course of a criminal activity, including a robbery and an assault with intent to commit a felony.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, the defendant did not have a gun, but he was emboldened to engage in criminal activity by the mere existence of the gun.  For example, the complaint alleges that, in the absence of a jury finding him liable for the felony, he was able to consent to the imposition of a civil penalty of 12 to 18 months, which is significantly higher than the mandatory minimum of 12 months.  On October 19, 2019, the Honorable Paul G. Kerstetter of the U.N. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Jersey issued an order requiring the court to consider whether to impose a penalty based on the defendant's prior criminal conviction for a related felony, and that the court should consider the need for a cross-reference between the defendant and the defendant in determining a penalty for which the defendant has a right to a jury trial.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Daniel J. Freed and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Office of Inspector General, and the Ohio Department of Criminal Justice."
