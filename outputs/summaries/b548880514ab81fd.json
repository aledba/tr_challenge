  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Mississippi man who was convicted of aggravated assault on a correctional officer by putting her into a chokehold.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Derrick Moffite violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Moffite agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a $1,176,500 civil penalty.  Moffite also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the SEC's orders.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Moffite.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy M. McCole granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, and a conduct-based injunction against further violations of the securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the court agreed to a permanent injunction and ordered Moffite to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay a civil penalty, and be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2018 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Aug. 2, 2018)."
