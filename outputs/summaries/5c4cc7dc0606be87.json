  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a final judgment against Loren E. Jones, a former middle school janitor who was injured while shoveling snow at the school. According to the court's order, on February 14, 2011, Jones was injured at work while lifting and carrying boxes of copy paper. The court found that Jones had suffered a serious neck injury in 2011 and a subsequent back injury in 2014. The Court also ruled that Jones should have had permanent work restrictions after the 2011 injury. Jones also claimed that he had lost the ability to perform any of the work tasks he performed due to his 2011 injury and that his 2014 injury arose from a workplace accident. Jones' injuries were so severe that he was unable to perform all of the tasks required of him. Jones was released to work without restrictions in 2014, but the court held that Jones' 2014 injury resulted in a 15 percent permanent partial impairment of the whole body.

Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Jones consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his compensation. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The court also granted Jones' motion for a temporary restraining order, ordered him to return to work, and ordered a hearing on the matter. The hearing is scheduled for May 24, 2018. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The examination that led to the finding of the finding was conducted by Eric R. Werner, under the supervision of Assistant Chief of the Kansas Department of Health and Human Services.
