  "summary": "On August 8, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Montana entered a final judgment against Coleton Christos Coburn, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 2015.  The court found that Coburn suffered from Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) but opined that his FASD did not make him unable to conform to the requirements of the law.  According to the court's order, based on Coburn\u2019s extensive criminal history, Coburn had a history of substance abuse and drug use, and he had been previously incarcerated for a prior felony.  Coburn also had a long history of alcohol and drug-related problems, including a stint as an officer and director of a public school.  In his sentencing hearing on August 9, 2015, the court found Coburn liable for the death of a two-year-old P.N. and sentenced him to prison with no parole restrictions.  As alleged in the court order, the defendant had a severe history of mental illness and drug abuse, and, in one instance, was the \"worst criminal record\" she had ever seen.  On August 11, 2015 Coburn pleaded guilty to a felony charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance, and the court ordered him to be sentenced to a prison term of four years and six months.  After Coburn was sentenced, he agreed to a five-year prison sentence without admitting or denying the allegations in the Court's order.  He also agreed to be barred from serving any prison term for five years and ordered to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Montana, charges Coburn with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  It also seeks an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, and a bar against Coburn from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of the proceeds of a federal criminal conviction. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Conte and supervised by Scott A. Thompson of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Montana Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, and"
