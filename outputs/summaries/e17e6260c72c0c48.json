  "summary": "On May 12, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida entered a final judgment in favor of the Florida Department of Corrections in a related criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, alleges that, in violation of Section 775.082(9)(a) of the Criminal Justice Reform Act of 1940, Florida passed a provision requiring defendants to be released from prison within three years of their release from prison. The SEC also alleges that the provision provides for release from a state correctional facility after serving a sentence of more than 1 year in a county jail.  According to the complaint, however, this provision does not apply to a defendant who is released from a prison without ever serving a prison-length sentence. Rather, the complaint alleges that defendants released from state correctional facilities are not entitled to the same treatment as those released from federal prison. In addition, as alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the provision requires that a defendant be \"released from a correctional institution\" within the three years preceding his or her commission of a qualifying offense. The complaint further alleges that Wright, Taylor, and Louzon did not qualify as a PRR because they were released from county jails after serving their prison sentences. Instead, the SEC alleges that they did not consider release from state prison as a reasonable alternative to incarceration.  In a parallel action, the Florida Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against Wright and Taylor for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"). The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  On May 13, 2018, the United States District Court in Miami entered final judgments in favor and against the defendants in the case. The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the release of any defendant from a federal prison for a qualifying felony. The Court also issued a temporary restraining order, ordering the defendants to return to their homes and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,000,000.00 each.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws. The final judgments also ordered the defendants not to participate in the issuing, purchase or sell securities in any securities offering or in any way related to the release or release of a criminal defendant."
