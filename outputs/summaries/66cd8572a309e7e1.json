  "summary": "On October 13, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey entered a final judgment against defendant Gary McCormick, finding him liable for past due rent to plaintiff-landlord Nezire Soyalan.  The court found that, in 2004, defendant signed a residential lease with plaintiff's mother for property located in Freehold, N.J.  According to the court's order, the lease required defendant to pay his rent by check or cashier's check until he vacated the property in December 2015. The court also found defendant liable for five months' rent, $1883.70 in rent, and $22,550 from 2013-2015.  In addition, the court found defendant entitled to additional sums from plaintiff for the return of his security deposit, as well as statutory damages and attorney's fees for the repairs defendant made to the property following the termination of defendant's tenancy.  On October 20, 2015, the Court entered a judgment finding that defendant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder, and that defendant is entitled to a civil penalty of $'1,800.00.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay $'2,500 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $3,500. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 4:37-2(b).
