  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Missouri today announced criminal charges against a Missouri man accused of kidnapping his brother.  According to the SEC's complaint, on November 28, 2014, James N. Rhymer pulled up in a four-door pickup truck and asked his brother, Corey Cornejo, to go with him to see his brother for the purpose of facilitating a felony assault.  The complaint alleges that, shortly after entering the residence, Corey was asked to remove a gun from his father's truck and demanded that he remove the gun from the truck. The complaint further alleges that after Corey refused to comply with the request for the gun and demanded the gun out of the truck and the truck keys, RhYmer fired the gun at Corey, who was lying motionless on the ground.  As alleged in the complaint, the gun was not visible because it was in his hoodie.  On the morning of November 29, 2015, Corey's father, David Mendez, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and second-degree kidnapping.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Central District of New York today entered a judgment of consent against Corey, finding him liable for second- and third-degree felony kidnapping, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $25,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Corey consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to disgorge his allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay civil penalties of $20,000, and be enjoined from associating with any person with a criminal record.  RhyMER also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, with the right to reapply at a later date upon motion of the court upon his motion of motion for a preliminary injunction.  He also agreed not to participate in the issuance of an officer-and-director bar in connection with the investigation of this matter.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David Zetina-Torres and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Missouri Department of Criminal Justice."
