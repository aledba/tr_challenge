  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered final judgments in a civil injunctive action against the Florida Department of Health and Human Services (DOHSA) for violations of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that Florida violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, beginning in 2013, Florida instituted a new convenience standard for private-duty nursing services provided to vulnerable children who were at risk of being institutionalized. According to the complaint, the convenience standard provided that each child was prescribed PDN services by his or her physician, requested Medicaid coverage, and was unlawfully denied coverage for those services. In addition, the complaint alleged that Florida inconsistently administered Pre-Admission Screening and Resident Review screenings (PASRR) to medically fragile children who require specialized services, such as nursing home care. The SEC alleges that the defendants violated the pre-admission screening and resident review provision of the DOHSA, by which Florida refused to reimburse certain services provided solely for the child\u2019s, parents\u2019, or caregivers\u2019 convenience, and by failing to provide timely and effective PASRR screenings.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Florida today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their roles in the alleged violations of these provisions.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the defendants\u2019 ill-gotten gains. The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the litigation. In a separate administrative proceeding, the court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of $1,078.95 plus prejudgment interest of $2,077.95.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions, ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and ordering the destruction of any evidence in the case. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for May 26, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2017."
