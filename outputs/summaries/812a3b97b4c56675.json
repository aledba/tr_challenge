  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Stepfather and Mother, finding that Stepfather had violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that, on April 4, 2011, Stepfather was criminally charged with exposing his penis and having sexual contact with his nine-year-old son, J.D., in an administrative hearing. The complaint further alleges that the defendant told the court that he was a hero for telling her what happened, that he did not do anything wrong, and that he needed to help her tell others about the bad things that he had done.  According to the complaint, however, the defendant did not tell the court about the alleged misconduct. Instead, the complaint alleges that he told the child that he \"did what the video did\" and that his son had been \"inappropriately touched\" by Stepfather.  Stepfather also allegedly told the children that he would help them \"stop daddy from doing that to you, or anyone else, anymore.\"  The complaint charges Stepfather with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Sections 9(a)(1), 10(c) and 13(b)(2)(A) thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint Bulletin, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and order Stepfather to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Child and Family Education (OCEA) today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0advisory\u00c2\u00a0to encourage parents to check the backgrounds of their children by using\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0assessment tool to determine whether their children are competent to testify.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint Bulletin\u00c2\u00a0on the subject of Child Abuse and Abuse of Children and Youth Services (OIEA) and a related Commission on the Status of Women (CYS).  The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Philadelphia Regional Office, with the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Human Services (DOH). The Commission appreciates the assistance in this matter."
