  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Texas-based company that claimed to have patented a series of aerial photographs of the City of Houston.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that Jim Olive, a professional photographer, and his company, Photolive, Inc., raised the issue of copyright infringement in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Olive's claims were based on a single act of infringement by the University of Houston, and Olive's claim was that the university had no right to use the photographs.  Olive's complaint further alleges that the University never contacted Olive about using his photograph, and the University immediately removed the photograph from the university's website.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, Olive consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Texas today announced criminal charges against Olive.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order against Olive, freezing his assets, and barring him from appearing before the SEC as an attorney or practicing before the Commission on Intellectual Property Litigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John R. Ruckelshaus and supervised by Marc Blau.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Insurance, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Texas Office of the Secretary of State."
