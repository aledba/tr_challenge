  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Fluent LLC, a New York-based internet service provider, for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Fluent violated the anti-spam provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 5b-5(b) and (c) thereunder.  Fluent has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $3 million, prejudgment interest of $1.2 million, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company.  According to the complaint, Fluent also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 17(a)(1) of The Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b)(5) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 10b2-5 thereunder, and to a five-year bar prohibiting them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Dudnikov and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Utah Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
