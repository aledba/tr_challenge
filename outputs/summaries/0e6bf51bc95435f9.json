  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Timothy Vincent White and Ann Coyle White in a civil injunctive action brought by the SEC against them.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, from 2008 through 2017, Tim and Ann were married for 25 years. The complaint alleges that, during the marriage, Tim received 4,900 shares of ConAgra stock and $100,000 from his late mother, who was a cofounder of the business. As alleged in the complaint, this appreciation was not due to the active efforts of either spouse. Rather, the complaint alleges, Tim's efforts were limited to replacing investment grade bonds with similar bonds, and the growth in the account was due solely to the efforts of his mother and father.  The complaint further alleges that Tim opened the account with the 5,000 shares, which were valued at $232,440, and then used the remaining 5,500 shares to pay the tax liability from the Schwab account.  In a parallel action, the SEC today announced that it filed an emergency action against Tim, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay $14,373 in disgorgement, $1,200,356 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $600,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Tim consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and enjoin him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in this matter."
