  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against M. Tracy James, a Colorado attorney who represented one of the children in seeking appointment as personal representative of the estate of her husband's estate.  The court entered the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  According to the court's order, James and his attorney, Robert A. Lees, drafted and drafted all or part of the legal documents and provided legal advice to James and her brother. The court also deemed that James failed to inform Patterson that probate proceedings had been initiated and that he had agreed to informal probate in an attempt to \u201cslip it through the probate legal process\u201d unnoticed.  James and Lees also raised separate issues regarding whether the trial court improperly dismissed their claims against James.  In a complaint filed in federal court in Denver, the court found that James violated the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 12(b)(5) thereunder.  Lees and James agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay joint and several fees and costs jointly and severally against each of them. The judgment also orders James to pay attorney fees in a civil proceeding.  On the same day that the court granted James the judgment, Lees filed a civil action against James, charging him with violating Section 13-17-201 of the Exchange Act and Rule 13-20-1 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  As a result of the settlement, James has been barred from appearing before the court as an attorney or practicing before the SEC as an individual and from appearing as a public figure in a public proceeding. In a parallel action, the Colorado Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against James arising from the same conduct. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
