  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas on December 19, 2019 entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC's complaint, filed on September 11, 2019, alleges that, in 1988, Congress repealed the federal statute imposing a divisional venue requirement in civil cases in federal court in Texas.  According to the complaint, the court found that, as a result of this action, the defendants were unable to obtain a court-ordered transfer of the case to another district or division.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to meet their burden of showing that venue is proper in the Marshall Division and that the case should have been brought in the Tyler Division.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1391, No. 1404(a) (Jan. 24, 2019) and Litigation Alert No. 1255 (Feb. 26, 2020).  The Court also granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 1404 of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b2-1 thereunder. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. McCole and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Adrianna Garrett and Garrett Londoff. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
