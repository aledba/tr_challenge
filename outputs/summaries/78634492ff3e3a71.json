  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, on September 2, 2013, defendant entered a guilty plea in a civil action brought by the court against him for violating the one-act, one-crime rule.  According to the complaint, defendant told the court that he had a special relationship with M.S., his 19-year-old stepdaughter, J.C., and L.S.'s mother, that he \"caresse[d] and kisse[rd] all over her body\" and that he could do as he pleased with her when she was younger.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendant had a history of drug and alcohol-related criminal conduct, including a felony conviction for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and that, as a result of his conduct, he was sentenced to a total of seven years in prison and ordered to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and from participating in any future conduct-based injunctive relief proceeding. The judgment also orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a $1,000 officer-and-director bar.  On May 23, 2016, the court granted the court's motion for a temporary restraining order against defendant and ordered him to return to the United States to be enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the Exchange Act. The court also granted the request for a preliminary injunction against defendant's future violations, ordering him to comply with the court order, and appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Department of Justice in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (March 21, 2013)."
