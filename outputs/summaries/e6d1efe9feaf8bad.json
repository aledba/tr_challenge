  "summary": "On August 9, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against the defendants in a civil injunctive action brought by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection District.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, charges the defendants with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, from September 2009 through September 2010, Forest Service employees Frank DelCarlo, Mike Jellison, and Jeff Barnhart worked on a Forest Service firefighting unit at the Plumas National Forest. The complaint alleges that one of the crew members was electrocuted by faulty wiring while showering at the base camp or fire station, and the other crew member was injured by a fire hydrant.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.  In a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the three defendants.  On August 10, 2018, the Honorable Rebecca M. Quigley entered a judgment permanently enjoining the defendants from violating the charged provisions, ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and pay officer-and-director and penny stock bars.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 814.2 (2014).  The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
