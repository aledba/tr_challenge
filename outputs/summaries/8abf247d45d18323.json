  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland today entered a final judgment in favor of Montgomery County firefighter John T. Maloney, finding that Maloney's injury arose out of and in the course of his employment.  According to the SEC's complaint, Maloney was injured while working as an instructor in the County's Candidate Physical Ability Test (CPAT) program for the recruitment of new firefighters.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of his work at the time of his injury, he was not permitted to spend the night at fire stations when he was injured.  Maloney also was not required to work during the day, and he did not have the right to participate in an on-the-job activity that required him to be in the position to perform his duties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Maloney.  To learn more about liability for an injury arising out of work, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, and No. 17-14.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the SEC also charged Maloney with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John D. Ingram and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maryland Office of Inspector General, and the Maryland Department of Insurance. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
