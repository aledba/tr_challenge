  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant in a foreclosure action against a real estate developer who allegedly failed to comply with the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, alleges that Erica Bardua, employed by CitiMortgage as Vice President-Document Control, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Bardua failed to provide sufficient evidence to support her assertion that the property was in default and that the lender could not foreclose on the property before three full monthly installments due on the mortgage went unpaid.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws and requires him to pay disgorgement of $200,740.00, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio today announced criminal charges against Bardua.  On May 24, 2018, the court entered a judgment in favor of the defendant in the foreclosure action, finding that the defendant violated Section 203.604 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") by failing to provide a sufficient basis for the defendant to complete a loss mitigation evaluation before filing for foreclosure. The court also found that, contrary to the defendants' claims, the defendants failed to fulfill the requirements of Section 203 and to provide reasonable efforts to arrange a face-to-face meeting with the mortgagor prior to filing foreclosure. In addition, the Court found that the defendants violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") when they failed to meet certain requirements of the mortgage and foreclosure provisions of the Mortgage Act. The Court also ruled that, in the alternative, defendants could not be held liable for summary judgment based upon the nature and existence of the alleged errors in the mortgage.
