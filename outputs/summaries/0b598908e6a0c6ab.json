  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against the City of Alton, Illinois and Brant T. Walker, a real estate developer, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Walker and his company, Sunnybrook LP, sought a court-ordered injunction to halt the development of a $500,000 condominium development in Alton.  The complaint alleges that, in early to mid-2017, a partner of Sunnybrook approached the city and its mayor, Brant Walker, for support for the development.  As alleged in the complaint, the developer agreed to make major changes to the condominium project, including adding 12 units for sale and a percentage of those reserved for veteran applicants.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the developer.  On March 21, 2019, the SEC filed an amended complaint against Sunnybrook, alleging violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10\u00c2\u00a0of the Exchange Act, and ordering the developer to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.
