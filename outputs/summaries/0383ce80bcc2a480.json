  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Salt Lake City Corporation (the City) and four other city prosecutors in a related criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Utah, alleges that the City of Salt Lake violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to disclose documents related to a public corruption investigation of the Ogden mayor's office.  According to the complaint, in July 2013, Trenton Mellen was pulled over by an Ogden City Police Officer for failing to stop or yield at a stop sign.  Mellen and his mother described the negative impact that the city's actions had on their lives and requested that the records be released so that they could be used in a civil action against the city.  Instead, the complaint alleges, the city misclassified the records as confidential because the information contained in the records did not support Mellen\u2019s claims that he had used Trazodone to treat a medical condition and that he did not use the drug.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Utah today announced criminal charges against Mellen, charging him with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charging Mellen with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Mellen consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty equal to or greater than the amount of his income.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Salt Lake Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Criminal Justice. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Attorney General's Office and Salt Lake County District Attorney's Office in this matter."
