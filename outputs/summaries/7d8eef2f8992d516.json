  "summary": "On May 24, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against Phoenix Feeley, a former circus performer, and her attorney, Michael Jurena, in a civil injunctive action brought by the SEC.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges Feeley with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Feeley has also agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil monetary penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Feeley consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering him to comply with the SEC order, and imposing a $1,000 civil penalty against him.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Feeley.  On May 25, 2017, the SEC filed an emergency action in which it issued an order suspending Feeley from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering her to surrender her passport and other documents related to the case to the SEC, including her travel documents, her bank statements, her driver's license, her passport, her driving history, her credit card information, her social security numbers, her car's registration and inspection numbers, and other relevant information concerning the use of excessive force.  It also ordered Feeley to surrender his passport, which he has not yet done, and that he will not be barred from appearing and practicing in the SEC unless he is deemed fit to do so by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-14, July 24, 2017 (2d Cir. 2018).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant Feeley's attorney, Raymond Santiago, as an additional relief defendant for the purpose of recovering his allegedly injured wife and daughter.   The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's New York Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, and the Department of Justice in this matter."
