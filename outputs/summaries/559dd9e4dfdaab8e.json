  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment against James Parker, Jr., who was convicted of three felony counts of armed robbery, four counts of aggravated assault, and two counts of possessing a weapon during the commission of a crime.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta on June 18, 2014, Parker was charged with three of the charged crimes.  The SEC alleges that Parker was the co-defendant in the scheme, and that he and his wife, M. M., met at a designated location in Clayton County, Ga. to complete the transaction.  Parker allegedly told his wife that he had a friend who could sell him additional televisions, and he was holding a gun when he and Hood approached the minivan and stole money from her.  As alleged in the complaint, however, Parker did not show any signs of a gun, and neither did he or his wife identify the object in his hand.  In its judgment, the court found Parker guilty of the three charges and ordered him to pay $1,500 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Parker consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Parker to pay a $2,500 civil penalty and disgorge his ill-gotten gains.  On June 19, Parker pleaded guilty to one count of attempted armed robbery and agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction, which prohibits him from participating in the purchase, sale, or promotion of any type of security, including through his work as an accountant or as an investment adviser.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  To settle the SEC case, Parker agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, including, without limitation, from associating with any third-party, including a broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, penny stock dealer, municipal accountant, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.   The settlement is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority."
