  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Wyoming today entered a final judgment against a former communications technician for the City of Gillette who was terminated for misconduct related to her work.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Wyoming, alleges that Catherine Mahoney violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the complaint, Ms. Mahoney, who was employed as a communications technician in the city\u2019s police department for over seven years, believed that her supervisor was not updating alarm registration tables. The complaint further alleges that she provided the tables to her supervisor without obtaining prior authorization, and she did not report her concerns to the department or the city administrator before she raised them with the council member.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Mahoney consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a penalty equal to the amount of her ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related matter, the SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an investor's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov account.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services in this matter."
