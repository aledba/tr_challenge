  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against Cameron Lee Hinton, a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for two counts of common law robbery.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Hinton violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he violated the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Section 13(b)(2) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The complaint further alleges that the court improperly sentenced Hinton in the aggravated range because it did not find the aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt, and instead imposed a 10-year penalty based on the fact that the defendant was on pretrial release at the time he committed the crime.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hinton consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his sentence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Hinton arising from the same conduct alleged in Blakely v. Washington.  Hinton agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in any officer-and-director or director-training program for at least five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 542 (January 24, 2018).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.N. Office of Inspector General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the North Carolina Department of Justice in this matter."
