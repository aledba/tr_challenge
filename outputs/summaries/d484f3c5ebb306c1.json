  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the state in a related criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that, on October 28, 2012, a West Haven, New York man and his co-defendant, Anthony Adams, provided the FBI with a series of test results that corroborated Adams' and Adams' claims that Adams' DNA profile matched the DNA found on a bandana recovered from a rape and murder victim. The complaint further alleges that Adams provided the analysts with a copy of the test results, which they used to determine whether Adams was a match to the DNA on the bandana. According to the complaint, however, the analysts did not use the matched DNA profile to determine Adams's guilt. Instead, the complaint alleges that the analysts provided the false testimony of one of the analysts, who was not present at the time of the alleged crime. The SEC also alleges that Degnan failed to corroborate Adams's and Adams's statements, and that she was not a sufficient substitute witness to convince the court that Adams was guilty of the charges.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against Adams.  On November 2, 2016, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also granted the defendants' motion for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to a jury trial, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The final judgment also orders the defendant to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.   The court granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a bar against Adams from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or prohibiting the SEC from conducting any such conduct, Adams consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordering him to pay $1,500 in disgorgment and a $50,000 penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson, David A. Kasper, and Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office."
