  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Wells Fargo Dealer Services, Inc. (\"Wells Fargo\"), a California-based car dealership doing business as CA Beemers, for failing to disclose that it had suffered \"frame/unibody damage\" from a prior automobile accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, charges that Wells Fargo violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $15,070 in civil penalties and to pay a $1,500 civil penalty.  As alleged in the complaint, the settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Tun.  According to the SEC, the court found that the defendants had violated Section 2983.4 of the federal securities laws, and that the court improperly barred Wells Fargo from representing itself in a settled civil action, and ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On August 25, 2014, the Honorable Frederick P. Horn of the Los Angeles District Court issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of Wells Fargo, and ordering the company to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  At the same time, the SEC issued an order suspending the sale of a BMW convertible convertible, which was intended to be used as a test car for the purpose of testing the safety of the car.  It also ordered the purchase of a second BMW convertible, charging the price of the second car at a time when the car had been in a collision and had not been in an accident or a collision.   The court's order also prohibits the sale or purchase of any BMW convertible with respect to a dealer, and prohibits the purchase or sale of any other BMW convertible without a court order. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and Glenn S. Gordon and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Attorney General's Office in this matter."
