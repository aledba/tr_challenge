  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against San Jose Police Department officers who allegedly caused an unruly crowd to gather at the McEnery Convention Center on June 2, 2016.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Jose, California, alleges that the officers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity because they did not know or care about the safety of the attendees.  In addition, the complaint alleges that one of the officers \"actively prevented [the] Attendees] from leaving the venue and directed [him] to turn left, into the crowd of violent anti-Trump protesters.\"  The complaint further alleges that, contrary to the officers' representations to the Attendees, the Officers were not liable for their actions.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants violated the federal securities laws by failing to adequately disclose to the attendees that they were in imminent danger of being attacked by an anti-fascist mob.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Separately, the court granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order against the officers, which is subject to court approval.  On August 2, 2018, the Commission issued an order suspending the officers from appearing or practicing before the Commission as part of a case that was being handled by the Commission under the supervision of the Chief of the Commission.  It also ordered the Commission to conduct an internal investigation that will determine whether the Commission violated the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Department of Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a business using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant"
