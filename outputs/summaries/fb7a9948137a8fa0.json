  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois yesterday granted summary judgment in favor of C3 Presents, LLC, a Chicago-based entertainment company charged with liability for a slip-and-fall injury suffered at the 2011 Lollapalooza music festival.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that C3 violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  C3's complaint alleges that it failed to adequately illuminate concert grounds and exits, place mats over slippery areas of the concert grounds, manage the concert crowd, and cancel the event.  According to the complaint, C3 also failed to provide a safe means of egress from the festival grounds when it designated an exit route that forced her to walk uphill, through rowdy crowds, over poorly lit, uneven, tree-clogged terrain, and into an open and obvious muddy area.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and orders C3 to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of Chicago today announced criminal charges against C3.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 24, 2016, for which the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Chicago Police Department, and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services."
