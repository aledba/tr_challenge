  "summary": "On November 5, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Robert Ladell, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to life imprisonment for first-degree rape and a second-degree felony rape.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least 2013 through at least 2016, Ladeck repeatedly violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that in 2013 and 2014, when he was indicted for the second and third-degree rapes of S.T. and J.S., he was the only African-American defendant to be found guilty of the charges. The SEC also alleges that he was not a fair and impartial juror because he did not have a good reputation in the community.  In 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert in the field of forensic interviewing. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and a civil penalty.  On November 6, 2017, the Honorable Katherine Dorroh of the New York District Court issued an order granting the SEC an emergency asset freeze and ordering the SEC to conduct an examination of the evidence in the case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, and prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for at least five years. The order also requires him to provide a copy of the judgment to the SEC, which is subject to court approval.
