  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against a former Marine who was convicted of second-degree murder for his role in the June 24, 2016 shooting death of Jeremy Davis.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bossier, Louisiana, alleges that Jeffery Sanchez Smith, who was a member of Teresa Cooper's family, was present at the Cooper house when the two men began arguing.  According to the complaint, Smith allegedly told Teresa Cooper that he could not have the case of water that he had opened because he had a violent past and stated that he often argued with her.  He also allegedly told her that, at the time of the shooting, she should not have been fuckin' with me, and that he told her \"Well, I told that mother fucker to stop messing with me.\"  The complaint further alleges that Kaderrick Cooper, who lives at 1029 Shirley Lane, and his brother, Jeremy Davis, both of whom also live at the same address, were present when the shooting occurred.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendant followed Teresa Cooper into the bedroom and pointed a gun at her son, who ran out of the room and hid behind a wall.  As alleged in the complaint filed in the SEC, the defendant was not present when Teresa Cooper and Jeremy Davis confronted him in the bedroom.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Smith consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable John M. Robinson entered the final judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to return to the United States and pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Judge Robinson also granted the motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-20/14, July 24, 2018."
