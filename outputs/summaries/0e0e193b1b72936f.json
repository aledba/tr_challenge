  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment ordering a temporary restraining order against a defendant in a child custody case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that William Michael Grissom of Memphis, Tennessee, and Nicole Xiomara Grissome of Athens, Georgia, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 36-6-106 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the court improperly classified each of the best interest factors in the child's best interest, including whether the child would be better off in a primary residential parent's home when the child resided in Tennessee with the mother.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the trial court failed to adequately consider all of the factors that could have contributed to the decision to place the child in the mother's care.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $1,000 each.  On May 18, 2019, the Court granted the defendants' motion for an emergency court order and ordered a hearing on June 20, 2018, to determine whether to issue an order permanently restraining the defendant from future violations of the charged provisions.  To determine whether the court should order an injunction against future violations, the SEC requested that the court consider the merits of the case before issuing an order imposing an injunction, ordering the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $500,000, and appointing a receiver to oversee the case. The court also ordered that the defendant pay a $1.5 million civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Feb. 26, 2019).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David B. Paschedag and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Children and Family Education and Advocacy, which has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0report\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0successor"
