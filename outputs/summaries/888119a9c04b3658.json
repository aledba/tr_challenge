  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment in favor of the District of Columbia in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, on January 3, 2015, John Mayfield, a convicted felon, was asked for consent to search his truck while the officer was conducting an unrelated search. The complaint alleges that Mayfield agreed to the search without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and agreed to be restrained from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Mayfield also agreed to a preliminary injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security or other security measure, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Strieff and supervised by Scott A. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in a real estate investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an Investor Alert about potential scams targeting investors in the securities industry.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and whether they have any background in law enforcement.  For example, the SEC encourages investors to invest in real estate development projects with the help of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).\u00c2\u00a0In a separate case, the Court of Appeals for the Northern District of Mississippi today issued a final opinion in a related administrative proceeding against Mayfield. The court granted the SEC\u2019s request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, and issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent investigation of the alleged violations of the federal securities laws. The order also requires the court to determine whether to impose a civil injunction against future violations of Section 15(b)(5) and (c).  The court also issued an Order suspending the issuance of an SEC-issued search warrant for Mayfield and ordering the investigation to be conducted by an independent team of professionals, including the SEC Enforcement Division."
