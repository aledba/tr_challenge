The court found that the company violated the federal securities laws by failing to comply with its obligations as a medical provider.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Haven, Connecticut, the company, which is headquartered in New Milford, Conn., was in possession and control of a robotic surgical system that it uses to assist in performing hysterectomies. The complaint alleges that, on May 11, 2016, the plaintiff experienced extreme pain on her left side with a black and blue bruise and, at an office visit with a medical equipment personnel, she was told that the robotic camera fell on the plaintiff's left side.
