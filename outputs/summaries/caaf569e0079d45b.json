  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Westwego, Louisiana man accused of orchestrating the October 19, 2015 murder of Kevin Thomas, Jr., who was fifteen years old at the time.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, Louisiana, on January 28, 2016, a Jefferson Parish jury found Kevin Thomas Jr. guilty of second-degree murder.  The complaint alleges that the jury found that defendant and his cousin, Daniel Bryant, had access to the stolen.9 mm Ruger, which was allegedly used in the murder. The complaint further alleges that defendant told his cousin that he was going to buy marijuana and that he had \"beefed\" with Kevin the night before he was murdered.  He also allegedly told his aunt, Nadia Wilson, that Kevin had called him from his house on October 17, 2015, and that the next morning, he and Hughes went to his aunt's house and stole a gun from the house.  As alleged in the complaint, defendant and Daniel Bryant were the only people at the scene of the murder, and the only witnesses to the murder were Hughes and Daniel.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Louisiana today entered a final judgment against Davis, finding that Davis violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Davis to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Davis consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and requires him to surrender his passport.  Davis also agreed to be permanently enjoined from associating with any third-party law violator.  On May 1, 2017, the trial court granted Davis' motion for a new trial and post-verdict judgment of acquittal, and ordered him to comply with the pre-judgment judgment by consenting to a hearing on May 5, 2017.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Orleans Office of Criminal Investigations, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, the U."
