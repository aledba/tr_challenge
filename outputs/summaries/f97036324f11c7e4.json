  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on July 24, 2018 entered a final judgment against Florida Secretary of State Kenneth Detzner in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that, in 2010, the Florida secretary of state issued an opinion in favor of on-campus early voting.  According to the complaint, the SEC's opinion violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the federal securities laws and registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint also alleges that the SEC improperly barred certain college and university students from participating in early voting because they were not registered to vote.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal laws, and from imposing any civil injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against two college students for their roles in the alleged violations of the federal anti-fraud provisions.  On July 26, 2018, the Court granted a temporary restraining order and issued an order temporarily restraining the defendants from violating these provisions and ordering them to comply with the court's order.  To learn more about early voting, see the Voting Rights Act of 1940 and the Voting Education and Advocacy Task Force's (Advisers) Complaint to the Commission on Education and the Rulemaking Process for Colleges and Universities."
