  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Google, Inc., a Texas-based internet service provider, and its subsidiary, Suddenlink Networks, LLC, in a patent infringement action.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Google violated the antifraud provisions of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 14b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Google failed to comply with the requirements of the Exchange Act by failing to disclose that the GGC servers and their locations were not \"regular and established places of business.\"  The complaint further alleges that, in violation of Section 13(b) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, Google violated Section 15(b)(2)(A) and 13(c)(3)(B).  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Google consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins it from violating Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-13, and 13b-11, and orders it to pay disgorgement of $1,078, plus prejudgment interest of $2,038, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Google.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action against Google and SuddenLink, charging the company with violations of the federal securities laws.  Google agreed to settle the action by consenting to a permanent injunction, which is subject to court approval.   The court also granted Google's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the company. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica and Ms. Scarlato of the Market Abuse Unit in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Insurance, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Texas Office of the Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
