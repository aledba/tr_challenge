  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a Lake Charles man accused of repeatedly stabbing a woman in the head, neck, and back during an argument.  According to the SEC's complaint, Ladray Bias, Jr. was arrested on July 28, 2016, and charged with attempted second-degree murder on July 29, 2016.  The complaint alleges that Bias and his cousin, Jeremy Bias of the Southwest Louisiana Crime Lab, confronted the victim in the living room of their home and told her he was going to kill her.  Bias allegedly told the victim that he would kill her because she was his second cousin.  He also allegedly told her that he had been in a fight with another woman, Melissa Fontenot, and had called her daddy.  As alleged in the complaint, the victim told Bias that she had been fighting with him and that she wanted to \"die like a bitch.\"  The SEC alleges that the victim's mother confronted Bias about the matter and confronted him about it, telling him to stop and to get out of the house.  In a parallel criminal action, Bias pleaded guilty to one count of attempted second degree murder and was sentenced to a total of seventy years in prison and ordered to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint filed in federal district court in New York, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $25,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his already-convicted criminal conviction.  On August 2, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Bias for the same conduct.  A hearing scheduled for September 11, 2017 was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Eastern.  To determine the severity of the alleged misconduct, the court ordered a hearing on September 13, 2017 to determine whether to issue an order imposing a permanent injunction, imposing an officer-and-director bar, and imposing a conduct-based injunction, ordering Bias to comply with the court's order, and ordering him to sign an order appointing an independent receiver to oversee the receiver of the receiver's communications.   The hearing was conducted by Christopher R. Ryan and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0"
