  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Alaska today announced criminal charges against R.C. for starting a fire on the playground of an elementary school in Anchorage, causing extensive damage.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Anchorage on July 26, 2014, the Alaska Attorney General's Office filed an emergency action and obtained an emergency court order to halt the restitution proceedings.  The complaint alleges that, in July 2014, R.c. and his friend, L.G., started a second fire at Willowcrest Elementary School in Anchorage. The complaint further alleges that the court ordered the defendants to pay restitution at an amount that would likely exceed their ability to pay during their juvenile probationary period.  In its order, the court found that the defendants did not have the capacity to pay when setting restitution amounts in criminal cases, and instead relied on an invited error doctrine to determine the amount of restitution.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay $159,161.17 in restitution to the school district and its insurance company, and to pay a civil penalty of $192,768. The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review of the restitution provisions of Sections 12.55.045(b)(4).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Denver Regional Office and the Fort Worth Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Alaska Department of Insurance in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0insights tool to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to identify whether there are any conflicts of interest."
