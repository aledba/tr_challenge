  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered a final judgment against Allaquan Jackson, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 14 years out of time for his role in the 1999 death of Shavonne Young, a sixteen-year-old girlfriend and the mother of their two children.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 22, 2015, Jackson, a New Jersey resident, falsely claimed that he, defendant, and his brother drove to Young's apartment, that the brother showed them the gun, and that he and Williams waited in the car while his brother went into the apartment and shot Young.  The complaint alleges that, in a phone call between Scocozza and Williams, Williams said her written statement was untrue.  As alleged in the complaint, the court found that defendant had no vested right to file a second PCR petition fourteen years after the date of the denial of his first PCR.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Jackson consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey announced criminal charges against Williams, charging him with securities fraud and other violations of the securities registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and with aiding and abetting Williams's violations of Rule 3:22\u20134(b).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Attorney General's Office, and the FBI in this matter."
