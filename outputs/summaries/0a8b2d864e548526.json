  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputy accused of acting as an unregistered broker of information in a criminal case.  The SEC alleges that Eric Watkins filed a motion for appointment of counsel in a civil case in 2006, alleging that the Broward District Court improperly excluded an audio recording of Watkins\u2019 testimony in a previous criminal case and instead limited his examination of Mobley.  According to the SEC, Watkins alleges that the district court improperly excluded the recording because it was relevant to show bias and prejudice against the defendant.  Watkins also alleges that, in a parallel action, the court denied his motion for motion for leave to amend a complaint, finding that Watkins was not competent to adequately present the facts of the case and that he had difficulty explaining the relevance of the evidence to the jury.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Watkins consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC charged Watkins with violating Section 15(e)(1) and Rule 15a-3 thereunder and charged him with violations of Section 17(a)(2)(A) of Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17(b)(5)(B) thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Watkins.    The case is being handled by John Rymas, Eric Watkins, and Amy Gwiazda of the SEC Enforcement Division's Fort Lauderdale Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Professional Regulation in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-11 (11th Cir. 2011)."
