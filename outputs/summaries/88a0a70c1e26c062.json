  "summary": "On December 21, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a related action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to provide sufficient evidence to justify the defendants' entry of a preliminary injunction.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that defendants failed to adequately demonstrate that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm from the alleged loss of market share for the InstantPC glycan reagent.  According to the complaint, the defendants also failed to show that the alleged losses would be compensated by monetary damages.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On December 22, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an emergency court order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of $1,078,098, plus prejudgment interest of $2,079, and a civil penalty of $100,000, and ordering the companies to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael Winter and supervised by Marc Blau.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Winter and Mr. Blau, and the case is being supervised by Chedly C.
