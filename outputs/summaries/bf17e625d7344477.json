  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that, on September 1, 2007, Shaw and Elizabeth met at the home of Elizabeth\u2019s father-in-law, who was a member of the GBI. According to the complaint, Shaw told Elizabeth that he would \u201cget so mean he\u2019d go hit the little boy and she would stand in front of him and scream.\u201d The complaint further alleges that Shaw was the last person to see Elizabeth alive before she died, and that he had been drinking heavily at the time of the alleged attack. Shaw also allegedly told Elizabeth he would hit her if she didn\u2019t stop him. The complaint alleges that the trial court found that Shaw had engaged in a pattern of dilatory tactics by failing to disclose prior difficulties in the relationship between Elizabeth and Shaw. The SEC also found that, based on the evidence presented at trial, Shaw did not have sufficient evidence to show that he was capable of accomplishing such a feat. Instead, the complaint alleges, he relied on the testimony of another witness, who corroborated the allegations in the complaint. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Shaw.  In its continuing investigation, the SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0feature to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Atlanta Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter. The Office of Inspector General's Office is continuing its examination of the case."
