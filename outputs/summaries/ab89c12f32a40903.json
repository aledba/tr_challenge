The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chesapeake, Virginia on August 28, 2017, alleges that Martin Kelly, who served as an information technology officer in the United States Coast Guard, engaged in a series of premeditated and self-destructive actions on the night of the February 5, 2015, shooting death of Lisa.  According to the complaint, the defendant had been obsessed with killing Lisa, and in turn being killed by police.  He allegedly planned to commit the murder by using plastic replica weapons, using plastic bullets, to gain more experience with wielding weapons in a combat situation.

On August 29, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Kelly, charging him with violating the federal securities laws, and ordering him to pay $1,500 in disgorgment, $100,000 in civil penalties, and a $50,000 officer and director bar.
