  "summary": "On April 23, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against SAE Power Inc., a technology company, and its former chief technology officer, Allan Brown, in an action brought by SAE alleging that SAE misappropriated trade secrets related to the functioning of its G650 Media Gateway server.  According to the court's order, SAE and Brown submitted to the Bankruptcy Court an estimate of SAE's trade-secret damages based on the fact that the bankruptcy court had previously deemed SAE liable for its misappropriation of trade secrets.  The court also found that, contrary to the Court's findings, the judgment did not require SAE to provide a reasonable valuation of its trade secrets, and instead relied on the testimony of Avaya's technical expert, Mark Horenstein, who agreed to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  SAE also agreed to pay a $1.21 million civil penalty, which is equal to the amount SAE has already paid to Avaya.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced parallel criminal charges against Avaya for its role in the alleged theft.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, charges SAE with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting to the SEC's allegations, Avaya has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders it to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1 million, and imposes a $25,000 civil penalty on SAE.  It also has agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay an officer and director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-10089 (January 21, 2018).  The Court's order also prohibits SAE from making materially false and misleading statements in its filings with the SEC, and prohibits it from issuing or selling any security or other security products without first consulting the SEC before making a determination about the safety and efficacy of the security or security of those security products.  Further, the court has not agreed to a settlement where it will determine the appropriate amount of civil penalties for SAE"
