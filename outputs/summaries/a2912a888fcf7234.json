  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the California Department of Attorney General's Office's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, alleges that California Attorney General Eric Schneiderman violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Schneiderman aided and abetted Schneiderman's violations of Section 1373 of the Exchange Act. Schneiderman agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The court also agreed to the entry and reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of federal law, and to the imposition of civil penalties against Schneiderman for violations of those provisions. The Court also found that the exemption provision does not apply to state law enforcement, and neither Schneiderman nor Schneiderman consented to entry-and-reporting provisions of any federal law. In addition, Schneiderman has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount Schneiderman and Schneiderman will pay in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in connection with the issuance of the SEC's order. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the California Office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (OIEA) in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1324a (January 29, 2018).
