  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jason Michael Strubberg, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 120 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release in violation of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that, on January 24, 2016, a federal district court in Manhattan, New York, entered a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(3) of Exchange Act Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of these provisions, ordering him to pay a penalty of 120 months, five years, and a $75,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Stubberg.  According to the SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on January 25, 2018, the SEC obtained an emergency court order halting the asset freeze, freezing the assets of the defendants, and imposing a conduct-based injunction.  On February 2, 2019, the U. S. District Judge in Manhattan entered a temporary restraining order against Strubberger, ordering the SEC to conduct an examination of the defendant's electronic devices, including his cell phone, computer, and digital camera, and ordering the court to determine whether to impose a civil injunctive relief.   The court also issued an order suspending Strubburg from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged scheme. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0investigative tool to identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In addition, the Office of Compliance has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint about the use of deceptive investigative techniques employed by the government, including false names, false appearances, and misleading statements about the nature of the alleged crime.  For example, the Department of Justice has issued\u00c2\u00a0a\u00c2\u00a0statement\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0falsely\u00c2\u00a0stated that\u00c2\u00a0the government engaged in\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0exchange of course"
