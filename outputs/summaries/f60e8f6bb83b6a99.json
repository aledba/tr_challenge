  "summary": "On July 20, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California entered a temporary restraining order and ordered the release of a mother and son separated from their children.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, Ms. E.F. and her son, M.G.U. and A.P.F., were separated on May 14, 2018 and were later reunited the next day.  The complaint alleges that, despite repeated requests for a preliminary injunction, the government has not provided any evidence that she is an unfit parent or presents a danger to her son.  Instead, the complaint alleges, defendants have continued to separate the two children from their parents, without a plan for reunification.  As alleged in the complaint, the separation from her son was so severe that she was unable to eat or sleep.

On July 16, the Court issued an order requiring the government to provide a joint status report to the court in order to determine whether to issue an emergency court order to expedite the court's approval of the order.   The court also ordered the government not to violate the due-process provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (d) of\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act of 1940 and Rule\u00c2\u00a010b2 thereunder.  It also ordered that the court consider the merits of the proposed injunction against future violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) and (c) thereunder of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-2, and 13b-11 thereunder; and that the Court consider the safety and security of the family members in its custody.
