  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment in favor of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission in a civil injunctive action brought by Perry Odom and his wife, Carolyn Odom.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, alleges that the Commission improperly certified the dual-capacity doctrine in violation of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Odom was injured by a trailer owned by Penske Logistics, LLC, which fell on him and injured him.  As alleged in the Commission's order, the Commission determined that, in addition to being immune from liability for its own independent conduct, an employer could be liable to a stockholder of its employer for independent tortious acts when the stockholder is not acting in the role of employer.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Odom arising from the same conduct alleged by the Commission in its complaint.  Odom has consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,078, which is equal to his civil penalty of $10,000.   The Commission's final judgment also orders the Commission to determine whether to impose a civil penalty against the company, its principal, officer, director, or stockholder, and to determine how to proceed with the investigation of the matter. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Jennifer C. McKinley.\u00c2\u00a0 The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oklahoma Department of Insurance, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General, the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations, the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations and the Oklahoma Office of Insurance Regulation."
