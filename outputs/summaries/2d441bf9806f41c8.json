  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Second Judicial District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment in favor of Hobbs Construction, LLC, a Mississippi-based contractor that was suspended from practicing dentistry on July 12, 2017.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Hobbs violated the antifraud provisions of Section 31-3-3 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Hobbs was not given notice of the Board's decision to suspend his license to practice dentistry and instead relied on prior complaints that he had oversedated some of his patients.  Hobbs's complaint also alleges that the Board of Contractors failed to consider prior complaints against Hobbs, and that, in addition to the prior complaints, the Board had failed to provide Hobbs with sufficient notice of prior complaints in making the revocation decision.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained a temporary restraining order, which prohibits Hobbs from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any type of contract, and orders Hobbs to pay disgorgement of $13,390, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in Hobbs' complaint, the SEC has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains the suspension of his license, and enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and Rule 13b2-2 thereunder, and to pay a $20,000 civil penalty in the amount of $11,570, which Hobbs consented to.  Additionally, the court granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  On July 21, 2017, the Honorable Judge Robert C. Hannan of the U. S. District court for the District of North Carolina issued a temporary injunction, suspending Hobbs and ordering him to comply with the court's order.  Hannan also issued an order requiring Hobbs not to participate in any conduct related to the conduct of others for the purpose of procuring planning board approval of the plans, knowing that the plans were not in compliance with the building code.  Hanover Bank & Tr. Co., Inc., a Flowood, Mississippi company, and its president, Allen Hobbs Mize, Jr., agreed to cooperate with the SEC in this matter."
