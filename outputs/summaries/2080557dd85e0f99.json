  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found incompetent to stand trial based upon his inability to waive his right to counsel.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Kenneth H. Hart was arrested and charged in 1998 with two felony counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault. The complaint alleges that, as a result of his arrest, Hart was unable to represent himself at trial, and he was required to show cause and effect why he would not be able to do so at trial.  The complaint further alleges that the trial court improperly imposed a higher standard of competency for defendants who were found competent to represent themselves at trial than the minimum standard required by the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Hampshire announced criminal charges against Hart arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint. The SEC's Complaint alleges that Hart violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, Hart consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, and orders him to submit to a competency evaluation. The judgment also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of securities in the securities industry, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The court also ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Hart also agreed to be barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney based on his prior criminal conviction.
