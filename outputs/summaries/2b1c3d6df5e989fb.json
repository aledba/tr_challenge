  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 18, 2020, entered a final judgment against a former Microsoft employee who was charged with stealing millions of dollars of digital currency from the company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Volodymyr Kvashuk used the usernames and passwords for two Microsoft online store accounts in order to fraudulently obtain digital gift cards from Microsoft Corporation.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that the test accounts belonged to Microsoft employees and that Kvishuk used those test accounts for personal purposes or to purchase digital currency.   The complaint further alleges that, in addition to using the test account and the password associated with those accounts, Mr. Kivashuk also used test accounts that belonged to other Microsoft employees, and that he supervised that he did not share their test accounts with other employees.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced that it filed criminal charges against Kvushuk.  On February 25, 2020 the jury convicted Kvistuk on all 18 counts of aggravated identity theft, and the court granted the motion for judgment of acquittal on all of those counts on March 5, 2020.
