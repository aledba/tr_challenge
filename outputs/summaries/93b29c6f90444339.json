  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Postal Service in a case brought by the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) against the agency.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Annandale, Va., alleges that the agency violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 12(b)(1) and Rule 13b2-3 thereunder, the agency has failed to enforce the federal anti-injunction provisions of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13d-1 thereunder and failed to impose any injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Postal Inspection Service (USP) announced that it would conduct an independent arbitration to determine whether it had violated the federal securities laws. The Postal Service's announcement of the arbitration followed an order by the court that temporarily enjoins the agency from violating the federal antifraud provisions and orders it to pay a penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties. The court's order also prohibits the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter to the letter carriers, and prohibits them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any mail to the public. The Commission on Postal Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Norman L. Cantor and Graham Loomis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Postal Employees' Association of America."
