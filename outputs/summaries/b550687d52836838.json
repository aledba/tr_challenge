  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in a civil injunctive action against a Pleasant Hills Police Department officer who conducted an investigative detention in a church parking lot just before 3 a.m. on January 10, 2016.  The court found that Officer Falconio violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that the officer had reasonable suspicion of criminal activity when he observed a car drive behind two closed businesses at 3:00 in the morning. According to the court's order, Falconio followed the car as it drove behind the businesses and observed a man sitting in his car. The Court further found that Falconio did not need reasonable suspicion or probable cause to conduct the investigative detention. Instead, the court held that he had a reasonable suspicion that the car was being followed by a person who was likely to commit a criminal act.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Falconio. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Falconio with violating Section 17(a)(1) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"). The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The case is being handled by David Bostick, Michael J. Burt, and Eric R. Werner of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Braunstein.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Police Department, and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities."
