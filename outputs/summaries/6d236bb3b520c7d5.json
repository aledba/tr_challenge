  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against Travis Glasco and two of his distributors in a drug-trafficking scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Tallahassee, Florida, alleges that, on August 31, 2016, Hunter was arrested for possession with intent to distribute alpha-PVP from China for distribution in Florida.  According to the complaint, after being arrested, Hunter and Glasco convinced a UPS Store employee to check her mailbox for a package that contained the drug. The complaint alleges that Hunter opened the mailbox in her name and, after learning that the package was for Glasco, purchased it from the UPS Store and then had the packages shipped to those mailboxes.  As alleged, Hunter then used the stolen package to make approximately $2,000,000 in illicit profits.  In a parallel action, the United States Department of Justice today announced criminal charges against Glasco.  On November 2, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Hunter, alleging that she violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Hunter aided and abetted Glasco's violations of Rule 404(b).  The complaint also alleges that Glasco aided in Hunter's possession, use, and distribution of the drug and that he and others, including Hunter's co-defendants Tyrail Gallman and Charik James, assisted in the investigation.  Hunter agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.   The settlement is subject to court approval.
