  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a $400,000 attorney's fee award to settle a class action action brought by two third-party debt collectors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Michael N. Litrowik, Esq., of the Bromberg Law Office, P.C., and Jonathan R. Miller of Miller, Inc. (\"Miller\"), of the Law Offices of Kenneth Hiller, PLLC, sought to collect a large amount of attorney fees and costs from third parties in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to adequately disclose to the court that they were not adequately compensated for their work in the class action.  According to the complaint, the defendants also failed to provide sufficient documentation to support their requests for a fee award.  For example, the SEC's Complaint Complaint Litigation Task Force has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adviser.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of overcharging for attorneys' fees in class actions.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool to find\u00c2\u00a0proof of identity and to identify whether their investments are being used to fund their retirement savings and to determine whether they have sufficient assets to support the retirement savings.   The complaint further alleges that, in a parallel action, Litrowick and Miller consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and requiring them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their attorney fees.  Litrowsick consented, without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from participating in any future class action litigation, and orders him to pay $1,000,000 in disgorgment and prejudgment interests, with the amount to be determined by the court at a later date.
