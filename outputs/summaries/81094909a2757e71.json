  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former state agency employee who was denied Social Security Disability Insurance benefits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that Teresa W. Hand, 49, was improperly told that she had a history of depression and anxiety starting in 2008, including manic and depressed episodes and past suicidal and homicidal ideations.  According to the complaint, Hand also had difficulty making a fist, opposing the digits of both hands, holding a pen, buttoning her jeans, and lifting a paper off the table.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hand consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains her ability to perform the work of the agency.  In its order, the court found that Hand violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the Commission of Social Security should adopt a \"stricter standard\" for assessing a person\u2019s disabilities.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13-20-17.    The Commission has agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and to pay an officer and director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission has also agreed to an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to issue a civil injunctive action against Hand.  On May 24, 2014, the Commission issued its final judgment denying Hand disability insurance benefits based on its finding that Hand had significant impairments, including carpal tunnel syndrome in both wrists, arthritis, bipolar disorder, and asthma.  It also ordered the receiver to provide a copy of the Commission's final judgment, which is subject to court approval.  To learn more about how to spot signs of impairment, see http://www.sec.gov/disabled.html   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Hand on May 26, 2014.  A parallel action was instituted on June 20, 2016, against the Commission, who also issued a finding finding that the severity of Hand's impairments was inconsistent with the record as a whole.  Among other things, the complaint alleges that Hand failed to adequately disclose to the Commission that she was suffering from severe, severe, and even disabling impairment.  As a result, the SEC has issued an order requiring the Commission to consider new evidence before it makes a final determination about whether to grant or reject a claimant's disability insurance benefit.
