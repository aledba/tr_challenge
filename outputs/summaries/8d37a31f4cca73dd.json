  "summary": "On April 30, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Puerto Rico's Attorney General and Secretary of the Department of Corrections for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Puerto Rico, alleges that Ricardo Lara V\u00e1zquez, the Puerto Rico Attorney General, and Erick Rol\u00f3n-Su\u00e1rez, the Secretary of Corrections, violated Section 1983 of the Exchange Act.  According to the complaint, the SEC's order granted the request for an automatic stay, which is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Puerto Rico today announced criminal charges against Betancourt-Rivera for his role in the alleged violations of the federal securities laws.  As alleged in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, filed on August 2, 2017 pursuant to the Puerto Rican Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) and filed under seal on June 30, 2016, the Court granted the motion for reconsideration on July 24, 2017.  On July 26, 2017, the court granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the Commission from issuing an order imposing an injunction, imposing a civil penalty, or imposing an officer-and-director bar on the Commission.  Without admitting or denying the Commission\u2019s findings, the Commission has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and ordering the Commission to conduct an examination of its books and records to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to justify an emergency court order. The Commission has also agreed to an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation.  A hearing is scheduled for May 24, 2018 to determine the appropriate remedies.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-2223, 2018 (D.P.R. Nov. 27, 2017).  The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Commission in this matter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The Commission's Complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties."
