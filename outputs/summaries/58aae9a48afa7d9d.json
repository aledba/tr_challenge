  "summary": "On September 11, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin entered final judgments in favor of two companies that claimed to develop a method of captioned telephone service that can help deaf and hard-of-hearing people use the public telephone system.  According to the court's order, Ultratec, Inc. and its subsidiary, CaptionCall, LLC (collectively, \"Sorenson\"), raised the issue of whether Sorenson violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The court found that, contrary to the jury\u2019s findings, the defendants did not initially consider using an echo cancellation in the one-line telephone system, and instead considered alternative methods to cancel the voice of the assisted user from reaching the call assistant in a two-line arrangement.  In a parallel action, on September 30, 2016, a federal district court in Wisconsin entered a final judgment against Sorec, finding that the defendants violated the anti-fraud provision of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay $5,443,487 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of the defendants\u2019 profits.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, the Defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions, ordering them to pay a total of $7,192,599, which is $5.443,484.61, and imposing a $10,000 civil penalty.  Soreson also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public telephone company for five years and ordered to pay an $8,500 civil penalty and a $1,500 officer and director bar.  Finally, Sorenson agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations.  On September 29, 2017, the court granted the defendants a temporary restraining order and ordered him to return his allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 14-CV-66-JDP, 2015 WL 5330284. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Patent Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
