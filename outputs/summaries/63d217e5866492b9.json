  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Douglas Brian McShane, Jr., who was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 40 years to life in prison.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on February 6, 2003, defendant showed up at his son's mobile home and demanded to know where his daughter was.  According to the complaint, the defendant told his son Brian that he had just shot one of three teenagers who had tried to steal his truck.  He also allegedly told his daughter Kristi that she had just told him to \"jumped up\" and \"were coming at\" him, so he fired at them.\"  The complaint further alleges that the defendant had had ample time to cool off after the first incident, when he saw two people pushing his truck out of the driveway.  As alleged, the defendants then ran into the field, where they were confronted by a group of teenagers who were trying to steal their truck. The complaint alleges that defendant had not yet had sufficient time to deal with the teenagers, but rather frustrated, angry, and determined to find the thieves.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against the defendant, charging him with one of those counts, and ordering him to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  On January 2, 2019, the U. S. District Judge in Jackson issued a temporary restraining order, ordering the defendant to return to his mobile home, and imposing a $2,000 civil penalty against him. The court also ordered him to sign a cease-and-desist order, which requires him to provide a copy of the court's order, including an explanation of why he did not do so, and to provide an explanation for why he didn't do so.  A hearing on February 13, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. for a hearing scheduled for 6:30 p.m., and the hearing was delayed until after the hearing to determine whether to impose a permanent injunction against further violations.  Judge Jackson granted the motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the defendant"
