  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant in a civil harassment case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Kevin P. Stennis and his wife Helaine Hatter violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Stennis filed a complaint in September 2007 alleging that defendants made false police reports, filed false civil harassment petitions, and filed false and misleading press releases in connection with two civil harassment cases.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants' conduct in filing the press releases and press releases constituted a protected activity under Section 527.6 of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the anti-tort provisions of Sections 527 and 527, and order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  Stennis also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Hatter agreed to settle the case against her by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities laws and to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000.  As a result of the settlement, Hatter was barred from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  To settle the civil charges, Stills and Hatter conspired to evade the SEC by filing false press releases, filing press releases with false claims about her husband, and filing false reports of child abuse with the SEC.  Finally, the court found that Hatter had a reasonable chance of prevailing on the charges against her based on her receipt of a subpoena and order for a TRO against her husband.   The court also found that defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Section 13(a) of Exchange Act and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Advisers\") and Rules 206(3)-8 thereunder and that defendants had violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of Securities Act and Section 15(b)(5) and (3) of The Exchange Act for aiding and abetting Hatter's and Stills' violations of Section 10"
