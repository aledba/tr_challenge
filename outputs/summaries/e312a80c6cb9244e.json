  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered final judgments against the City of San Jose and City of Los Angeles in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Jose, California, alleges that San Jose violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the City knew that a medical marijuana collective was not an authorized use of the subject property and ordered the collective to close in 2010. The complaint also alleges that the city delayed enforcement and collecting marijuana business taxes for the collective until after the collective opened, when it was not a permitted use under the Municipal Code.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in 2010, the city issued a compliance order to the collective stating that it \"may not qualify due to the residential use located next door.\"  The complaint further alleges that defendants were on notice in 2010 that their collective might not be a permissible use because it met the definition of a medical office, which was not intended for regulation.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties of $150,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.  Separately, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Los Angeles, charging San Jose with violating the federal anti-fraud provisions, including Section 10-b of the Exchange Act, and Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting San Jose's violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) and Rule 13a-14 thereunder and the complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and a penny stock bar against San Jose. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John B. Sansone and supervised by Marc Blau of the Los Angeles Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Office of Inspector General."
