  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against defendant Antonino Flores and ordered him to surrender his passport.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, the defendants entered an apartment building without a warrant or consent and entered the apartment with the intention of conducting an investigative detention. The complaint alleges that the officers entered the defendant's apartment and observed him running through an alleyway and into the apartment building. The court found that defendant was not restrained by the officers, and that he was not subject to unreasonable searches and seizures.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC also announced that it would conduct an asset freeze and other emergency relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Flores consented to the entry and search of his room, which was conducted in the absence of any reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. The judge granted the court's order and ordered the officers to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The defendants agreed to a permanent injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws and to the issuance of a cease-and-desist order. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Ms. Bower. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
