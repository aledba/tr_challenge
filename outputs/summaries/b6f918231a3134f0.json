  "summary": "On March 29, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of Lucille Asher, who died in 2012.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on January 8, 2016 (D.N.M. Day), Lucille's estate was named as a defendant in a state court action to compel arbitration of a nursing home admission agreement.  The court held that, as a matter of law, a court can determine whether a party has a right to participate in an arbitration proceeding and determine whether it has a duty to do so.  In its judgment, the court found that the parties to the arbitration agreement had a duty of care to each other, and that, in the event of an arbitration action, the parties had the duty to provide for the care, custody, or residency of the other party in the matter.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, the defendants consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of $75,000, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The judgment also ordered Erwin Associates to pay a $20,000 civil penalty, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the parties.  On February 9, 2017, the Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants, ordering Erwin to comply with the court order, and appointing a receiver of the assets of the defendants.  A hearing is scheduled for March 24, 2016.
