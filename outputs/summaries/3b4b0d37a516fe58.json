  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Oregon, alleges that defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, defendants used a marked railroad crossing to access their homes from the South Santiam Highway.  As alleged, the defendants' use of the crossing created a presumption of adversity in awarding each of them a prescriptive easement to cross AERC\u2019s property.  In addition, the court found that defendants did not have the right to use the crossing by virtue of a pre-emption provision of the federal securities laws, and that defendants failed to prove that their use was adverse to the owner.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   The court also ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, which is $20,000 less than the amount of their disgorgements, and ordered the companies to pay civil penalties of $50,000 each. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by David Wels and supervised by Scott L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice in this matter."
