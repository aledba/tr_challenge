  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mark Alvin Hampton, Sr. and his half-brother.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Hampton was the subject of a search warrant executed on his father\u2019s home on January 28, 2016. According to the complaint, Hampton told the FBI that he personally observed between 25 and 30 firearms stored in gun cabinets in Hampton's residence and that he knew that Hampton regularly carried a handgun on his person and in his vehicle. The complaint further alleges that, based on Hampton\u2018s testimony, he believed that the FBI had probable cause to search the home because the information contained in the affidavit was stale.  Hampton also alleges that he had recently purchased a hunting license, and obtained endorsements, to hunt turkey, antlerless deer, waterfowl, woodcock, sharp tailed grouse, and migratory birds, and that, on the night of the search, Hampton asked his half brother to come to the house the night before his father died. The FBI agent replied that he did not believe that Hampton ever owned or possessed a firearm, but that Hampton had attempted, but failed, to obtain one. The court ruled that Hampton violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019\u0080\u0099s Office for New Jersey today filed criminal charges in the case against Hampton.  On November 2, 2017, the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan entered a final judgment against Hampton, ordering him to pay a civil monetary penalty of $1,000, and ordering him not to participate in the issuance or purchase of any hunting licenses. Hampton agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  A hearing for Hampton is scheduled for May 24, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.   The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State Attorney General's Office, the FBI, and the Department of Justice in this matter."
