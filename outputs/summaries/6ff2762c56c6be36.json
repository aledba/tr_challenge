  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of Lincoln in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Placer County, California, alleges that the U. S. Air Force constructed and operated an intercontinental ballistic missile launch facility whose refuse was taken to a landfill in Lincoln, California.  According to the complaint, the Army Corps of Engineers contracted with Peter Kiewit & Sons Co. to construct and operate three Titan I Intercontinental Ballistic Missile launch facilities near Beale Air Force Base in the cities of Lincoln, Sutter and Chico.  As alleged, the Air Force had discretion to segregate the waste from other waste, but did not have the discretion to do so.  In a parallel action, the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained a court order halting the pending litigation.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the federal antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also granted the city's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the destruction of documents, including documents and records, from being used as evidence in a criminal case.  On May 26, 2016, the United Kingdom's highest court entered a judgment ordering the court to consider the merits of the case against the city.  It granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction, entered a default judgment, and ordered the city to pay civil penalties of $1.5 million, $2,500 in disgorging and prejudgment interests, and a $1,500 civil penalty for a further $500,000 civil penalty.  Separately, on May 24, 2017, a federal district court in New York granted the City's request to appoint a receiver to oversee the collection and disposal of hazardous waste at the site of an Air Force base.  A receiver will be appointed by the receiver at a later date.  An SEC order appointing a receiver will determine the amount of money to be spent on the receiver.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-0117 (January 24, 2013).  The court's order against the receiver requires the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by John R.
