  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on February 5, 2018 entered a final judgment against defendant Tomas Berhe, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering Berhe to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  The court also issued an order suspending Berhe from appearing before the SEC as a trial judge.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., on March 22, 2013, Berhe was convicted of first-degree murder and charged with second-degree criminal conduct. The SEC alleges that Berhe consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Berhe.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court agreed to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a hearing to determine whether to hold a new trial without an evidentiary hearing. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On February 4, 2018, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans of the Court granted the SEC\u2019s request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, and ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of the evidence in its case.  A hearing for the SEC case is scheduled for March 26, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 543-4-1, 2018 WL 704724.  An SEC hearing on February 6, 2018 will be conducted on the record and supervised by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney\u2018s Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission in this matter."
