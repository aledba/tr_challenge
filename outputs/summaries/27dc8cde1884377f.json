  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a final judgment against IMAPizza, LLC and its owner, Bhasker Dhir, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., on February 24, 2017, the defendants allegedly engaged in a multi-pronged scheme to steal the company's intellectual property.  The complaint alleges that, among other things, that Dhir and Dhir illegally entered the United States for the purpose of acquiring and selling a copy of a restaurant's name and logo.  As alleged in the complaint, Dhir allegedly used the stolen intellectual property to create a \"trademarked name\" and \"look and feel\" of the restaurants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by David Nimmer, Melville B. Nimmer and David N. Burt of the Boston Regional Office, with assistance from John Rymas of the Office of International Affairs and the Division of Justice's Cyber Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by John N. Brunson and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
