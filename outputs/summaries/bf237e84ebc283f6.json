  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri yesterday entered a final judgment against Union Electric Co. (\u201cAmeren\u201d) for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Ameren violated Rule 20.093(1)(F) when it failed to use the same methodology used by the Commission in its 2014 Energy Efficiency Investment Plan.  According to the complaint, Ameren failed to calculate its avoided costs by using the same method or formula for calculating net shared benefits, which the Commission found to be inconsistent with Ameren\u2019s performance and benefits.  Ameren also failed to include in its plan the calculation of avoided costs that was required under the 2014 plan.  In its complaint, the SEC alleges that the Commission improperly relied on the misstatements in the plan and failed to inform Ameren of its obligations under the 2015 plan. The complaint further alleges that, in its judgment, the Commission failed to provide Ameren with sufficient information to determine whether it was required to update the avoided costs estimates.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, Amere consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $73 million. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the Court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of Ameren's assets and liabilities, as well as an order appointing a receiver to oversee Ameren and its related projects. The court also ordered Ameren to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,078, which is equal to the amount Ameren has already paid to settle the Commission's charges.

For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (January 20, 2012).  The Commission's order also prohibits Ameren from using the term \u201cmethodology\u201d in its proposed energy efficiency plan, and requires it to use a different methodology to calculate avoided costs when calculating those avoided costs. The Commission also has agreed to a permanent injunction against Ameren using the terms \"methodology\" in the proposed energy-efficiency plan."
