  "summary": "On June 19, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against a New York City-based construction company and its owner, Kevin Mannix, in an ongoing labor action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, from at least April through mid-May 2019, Mannix and his employer, Kimco Realty and GTL Construction LLC, engaged in a series of actions that included the use of inflatable rats and a large cockroach to \"shame\" a secondary employer.  According to the complaint, these actions violated the antifraud provisions of Section 8(b)(4)(i) of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Exchange Act Section 17(a) and (c) thereunder, as well as Section 15 of the Exchange Act and Rule 15a-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a separate administrative proceeding, Judge Block issued an order suspending Mannix from participating in or participating in any activity that constitutes a violation of the anti-fraud provisions, including the issuance of a preliminary injunction, and ordering Mannix to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On July 24, 2020, the court granted the request for an emergency asset freeze and ordered the return of the allegedly inflated rat and the inflated cockroach, which were allegedly used by Mannix employees to demonstrate their displeasure at the construction of a new grocery store, to be replaced by an officer and director of a publicly-traded company.  A hearing on July 26, 2020 is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
