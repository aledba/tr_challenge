  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Utah yesterday entered a final judgment against Zane Charles Sanders, Jr., a Utah resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 503 of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that, from at least June 2013 through September 2014, Sanders, a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, attempted to convince a jury that he had an innocent possession defense when, in fact, he had not.  According to the complaint, Sanders claimed that when the officers arrived at his home, he was moving his girlfriend's son\u2019s firearm back into the house.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, Sanders had not demonstrated that a legislative policy barring convicted felons from temporarily possessing a firearm permits him to have the weapon.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Sanders failed to demonstrate that a reasonable course of conduct would permit him to possess the weapon, and failed to show that the Legislature intended to criminalize his conduct.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Sanders consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating Section 503 and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Utah Code \u00a7 76-10-503(1) and Utah Code \u00a7\u00a7 76-1-104(2) (2014).  The complaint charges Sanders with violating Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 5b-5(a) and 5c-8(c) thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, offer, or promotion of any security measure in the United States, including the issuance of a court order requiring him to surrender his or her firearm.  It also seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of Section 5, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-20, 13a-1, and 12b-13 thereunder.  Further, the SEC is seeking a temporary restraining order against Sanders and a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from using or selling any of the securities in violation of Section 50(b).  In a parallel action, the Utah Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Sanders arising from the same conduct alleged by the complaint.
