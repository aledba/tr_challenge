  "summary": "On April 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Ohio entered a final judgment in favor of Sami Sosnosnoswsky, an Ohio resident who was gifted money to be placed into a trust until she turned 18 years old.  The court found that the probate court had exclusive jurisdiction over the estate and person of a deceased person.  According to the court's order, which was entered on April 13, 2018 and unsealed on May 5, 2017, the court held that the court had jurisdiction over all matters \"touching the guardianship\" under the federal securities laws, including, but not limited to: (i) a designation or removal of a beneficiary of a life insurance policy, annuity contract, retirement plan, brokerage account, security account, bank account, real property, or tangible personal property; (ii) a change in the title to any asset involving a joint and survivorship interest; and (iii) an alleged gift.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued an order suspending the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter to the trustee overseeing the estate of a ward of the state.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the trustee has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the trustee to pay disgorgement of $19,057.40 plus prejudgment interest of $50,000, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On May 18, 2017 the court granted the trustee's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, which is pending final approval by the court. The court also granted the estate's request to appoint a guardian, a trustee, and several financial institutions as defendants. The trustee has agreed to the appointment of a new attorney, a receiver, and to the payment of civil penalties in the amount of $2.6 million. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for May 24, 2018. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Department of Banking and Securities."
