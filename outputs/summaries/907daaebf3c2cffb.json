  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a Florida-based trustee for a discretionary family trust settled by her father, which contains a spendthrift provision.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, on October 2, 2016, a Florida judge issued a judgment that, among other things, treated the wife's \u201cright of withdrawal as income to her, and excluded the husband's annual bonuses on the ground that they fluctuated and were not guaranteed.\u201d  The court also ordered the independent trustee to withhold any payment or distribution of income or principal from the wife until the wife exercised her right of withdrawal.  In its judgment, the court found that the wife violated the trust's spending-spending provision, which requires the trustee to allocate a certain amount of assets to the wife.  The judge also found that, as a result of the court's order, the wife was not entitled to a share of any assets in the discretionary trust, including her husband's 401(k).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the husband.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John R. Rymas and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Banking and Securities."
