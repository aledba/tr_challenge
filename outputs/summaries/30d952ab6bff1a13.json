  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Airbnb, Inc. (\"Airbnb\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, from at least 2009 through 2015, Airbnb and its co-founder and CEO, Kevin Spacey, created and operated an online website that included an arbitration provision. According to the complaint, the arbitration provision in the TOS, which is intended to determine whether an agreement is valid and enforceable, was not present when the parties signed the agreement. The complaint further alleges that Spacey and Spacey did not even read the arbitration provisions of the agreement and did not respond to requests for an explanation of why they did not read the terms of the contract. Spacey also allegedly did not reply to a question about whether Spacey had replied to a message from Spacey on the same day that he had responded to one of Spacey's e-mails. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Spacey. The SEC also issued an emergency action freezing the assets of the company and charging Spacey with violating the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of its Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"). The court's order freezes the assets and proceeds of the defendants' alleged violations. The court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC announced that it had obtained a court order halting the alleged violations of the federal securities laws, ordering an asset freeze, and imposing an officer-and-director bar. The Court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the company's assets, and ordering the company to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million.  On May 22, 2016, the court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations, and issued an order suspending the registration of certain of the companies in violation of Section 206 of the Exchange Act. The order also temporarily halted the issuance of an emergency court order prohibiting the issuance, purchase, offer and sale of any security, and other emergency relief. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Spacey consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, orders him to disgorge $1,500 in ill-gotten gains, and orders Spacey to pay"
