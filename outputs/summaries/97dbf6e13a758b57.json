  "summary": "On June 27, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan entered a final judgment against a Michigan-based company and its principal for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Detroit, Michigan, Bettina Winkler was denied admission to Notre Dame Preparatory School, a private, Catholic high school in Pontiac, Michigan.  The complaint alleges that, despite being told repeatedly that she had a learning disability, defendant denied her admission because he believed that she would be guaranteed placement in Notre Dame Prep for High School 9th grade.  As alleged in the complaint, the complaint further alleges that despite having been told that the PWDCRA does not apply to religious schools, defendant allegedly relied upon her learning disability as a justification for denying her admission.  In a parallel action, the Michigan Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against Winkler.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office and the Division of Education's Office of Education and Advocacy and has been aided and abetted by the Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations. The litigation will be led by John Rymas. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Michigan Department of Education in this matter."
