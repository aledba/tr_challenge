  "summary": "On May 21, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan entered a final judgment against a Michigan man who was convicted of two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, from at least June 2016 through September 2017, defendant, who was board-certified in child abuse pediatrics, repeatedly had sexual contact with a child while she was under the age of 12, repeatedly masturbated with the child, and repeatedly touched her vagina.  According to the complaint, Dr. Simms' testimony, which was contrary to the court\u2019s order, was inadmissible because she was not qualified as an examining physician to determine whether a child had been sexually abused.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, prejudgment interest of $2,038.81, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against defendant.  On May 22, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the Federal Bureau of Investigation entered final judgments against defendant and his family, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest in a related criminal proceeding.   The court also ordered the prosecution to show cause and effect, including a copy of the SEC's Complaint Bulletin, to be filed with the SEC on May 24, 2018. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter."
