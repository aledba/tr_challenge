  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of Nettie Dean, the former chief financial officer and secretary of Elevating Boats, L.L.C., who died on August 26, 2010.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, N.ettie's will was filed on August 20, 2010, and was signed by her father, who was the company's CEO at the time.  The complaint alleges that the will, which was filed in the court's jurisdiction, alleges that Serigne, Cure, and Richard Dean prepared and executed the will without her knowledge or consent, without the knowledge or authorization of the court, and with the assistance of a succession representative.  Serigne and Cure agreed to the judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, and Serigne agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced parallel criminal charges against Nittie Dean.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can\u00c2\u00a0find investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly and easily search for investor information.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that, in the course of its investigation, the SEC obtained a court order halting the sale of certain Class A units to a third party, preventing the sale or destruction of any of the Class B units, and freezing the assets of the third party. \u00c2\u00a0In its order, the court also ordered the SEC to conduct an independent investigation into whether or not to issue an order suspending the sale, purchase, offer, or sale of any Class A unit, and to provide an accounting of the assets and liabilities of the remaining class A units in the company.  To determine whether to proceed with the investigation, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-11.  This matter was investigated by Michael Chafetz, John Thompson, and Amy Gwiazda of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit, and the case was supervised by John Thompson."
