  "summary": "On March 16, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment finding Patrick guilty of domestic assault in the third degree pursuant to Section 565.074 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on November 7, 2016, Patrick made a threatening phone call to a day care operator in which he claimed to have a knife and threatened to kill her.  According to the complaint, Patrick told the operator that he had just threatened her with a knife when he said he would kill her the previous evening.  Patrick also allegedly threatened her grandson, telling her that he would \"kill you all\" if she didn't get out of the house.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, Patrick did not threaten her with the knife.  Instead, the complaint alleges that Patrick used the recording to make a series of threatening statements, including one in which Patrick allegedly said, \"I just threatened my life! He just said he was going to kill me!\"  The complaint further alleges that one of the men in the video was Patrick's brother, whom the SEC alleges was a good brother who transported both Patrick and H.P. back and forth from work.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Patrick consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Patrick.  On March 17, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Patrick, charging him with violating Section 567.072 of the Exchange Act and Rule 565-074 thereunder. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  A hearing on March 24, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. EST.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Missouri State Attorney General's Office, and the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
