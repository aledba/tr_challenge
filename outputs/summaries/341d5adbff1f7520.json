  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered final judgments against two men who were convicted of first-degree murder and other felony charges in connection with a home invasion robbery.  The court also entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 190 of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, filed on April 18, 2016, the defendants agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the court.  Austin also agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 190 and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Austin.  On November 29, 2012, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order against Austin and ordered him to return to California to be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of pre-judgment or officer-and-director bars.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the San Francisco Regional Office and the case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the California Department of Justice in this matter.  For further information, see\u00c2\u00a0Investigations in the Criminal Justice Litigation Division's Cyber Unit.\u00c2\u00a0On November 30, 2013, a jury found Austin liable as an actual killer under Section 190.2(b) for the November 2012 robbery of Raveesh K. and Harinder K. Karpeles, Inc., a Santa Clara County district attorney's office, for aiding and abetting Austin's violations of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and for Austin's participation in the September 2013 robbery of a Monte Sereno, Calif. home.  Among other things, Austin has agreed to a permanent injunction prohibiting him from associating with any person who is not a member of a criminal organization, including a felon in possession of a firearm, from participating in a felony-murder special circumstance, and to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest in the case.  Additionally, Austin consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from further violating the charged provisions, ordering him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.95, prejudgment interests of $2,077.55, and a civil penalty of $250,000.  To settle the case, Austin agreed to the appointment of a receiver to facilitate the investigation. "
