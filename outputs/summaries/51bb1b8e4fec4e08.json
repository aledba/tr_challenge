  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Utah today entered a final judgment against Michael Jordan, Jr., a West Valley City, Utah resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Utah, alleges that Jordan violated Section 23B of the federal securities laws by failing to disclose to a jury that he had been sexually abusing two of his stepchildren.  According to the complaint, Jordan was convicted on all thirty-three counts of child pornography in 2008.  Jordan was found in possession of photographs of his toddler-aged son, one taken in the bathroom, and one taken along a canal.  As alleged, Jordan told the jury that the two photographs were not objectively sexual and that he did not possess the images.  In addition, Jordan alleges that he failed to corroborate Jordan\u2019s statements to the jury, and failed to show sufficient evidence to support his conviction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Jordan has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.   The court also granted Jordan a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the United States, including securities in exchange for a share of the proceeds of the sale of a security deposit, a penny stock, and an officer-and-director bar.  Additionally, Jordan agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $10,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000, which would be offset by a $50,000 penalty for each of the six counts Jordan has already pleaded guilty to.  Finally, the court granted Jordan's motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval, and ordered him to return to the district court for a hearing on the issues raised in the complaint.  On the SEC's continuing investigation, the agency's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation has been conducted by Michael Jordan and supervised by Scott R. Kasper of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Attorney General's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
