  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission against Minnesota Power, a publicly-traded company, and its subsidiary, Minnesota Electric, Inc., in a rate case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnesota, alleges that Minnesota Power violated the plain language of Minn. Stat. \u00a7 216B.1696 by excluding approximately $\u200215.5 million of additional sales revenue from Minnesota Power\u2019s 2016 general-rate case. The complaint further alleges that the commission improperly accounted for the additional revenue in the EITE docket, rather than in the rate case, and that the Commission failed to properly preserve the issues for judicial review.  According to the complaint, Minnesota Power and Minnesota Power failed to comply with the Commission's order, which required the Commission to account for additional revenue that it received from non-EITE customers in the course of providing service to a customer under an EITE rate schedule.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, the Commission has agreed to the entry of a final order that permanently enjoins Minnesota Power from violating the federal securities laws, orders Minnesota Power to pay a civil penalty of $'15,5 million, and imposes a $25,000 civil penalty for Minnesota Power.  Minnesota Power has also agreed to a settlement where it will be permanently enjoined from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC charged Minnesota Power with violating the same conduct that led to Minnesota Power's action in 2016. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and a court order prohibiting Minnesota Power or Minnesota Power subsidiary companies from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any EITE-related product or service. The court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties at a later date.  On May 29, 2018, the court denied the LPIs\u2019 request for a writ of certiorari, which would have required the commission to determine whether Minnesota Power had complied with the requirements of the federal law, and ordered it to file a rate-design proposal with the court. The same day, the commission issued an order ordering Minnesota Power not to exceed $15 million in revenue from EITE customers, and ordering the company to pay an additional $2.6 million in pre-judgment interest. The order also requires the company not to overbill its customers in connection with providing service under EITE."
