  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia today entered final judgments in favor of a West Virginia Board of Medicine disciplinary action against a former hearing examiner for misconduct in connection with a purported sexual relationship between a patient and her husband.  According to the SEC's order, filed in federal court in Kanawha County, West Virginia on July 13, 2018, the Board of Medical Education (BMA) improperly reviewed text messages purportedly obtained from a hearing examiner and found that Dr. Hasan engaged in an improper sexual relationship with M.B., which led her to attempt suicide when she was terminated by her husband, and that the hearing examiner improperly considered the content of the text messages.  The court also found that the Board failed to adequately consider the evidence presented in its final order.  In its final judgment, the court found that, under Rule 901(a) of the West Virginia Rules of Evidence, social media text messages may be authenticated in numerous ways including, for example, by a witness who was a party to sending and receiving the texts, or through circumstantial evidence showing that she had worked that night and had seen no one.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Board's final order, the board agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a)(1) and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the federal securities laws, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  It also orders the Board to pay a $3,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Cyber Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Basinger and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Virginia Department of Health and Human Services, and the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia."
