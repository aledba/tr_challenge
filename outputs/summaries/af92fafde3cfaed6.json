  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control against the company for violating the due process right to a fair and impartial decision maker.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Marin County, California, alleges that, in 2004, the California Secretary of State's Office issued an order requiring the company to cease and desist from engaging in unpermitted development of a 1,060-acre mariculture facility in and adjacent to Point Reyes National Seashore.

Defendants' participation in the administrative proceeding does not violate the right to due process rights as alleged in the Complaint. Defendants are also prohibited from acting as a decision maker in a quasi-judicial administrative proceeding unless there is substantial evidence to support that finding.  As a matter of law, Defendants have the burden of proof and persuasion to determine whether they are entitled to participate in a proceeding that is subject to court approval. Defendants, however, are not entitled to the same level of impartiality as Defendants. Defendants' compliance with the Commission's orders is not subject to the court's approval of any judgments.
