  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Ricky Ricardo Mancilla-Ibarra.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, during a sting operation conducted by the Drug Enforcement Administration, officers observed a white van with Georgia tags approach Fann's home and pulled through the open gate on the side of the house.  According to the complaint, the van was accompanied by a man named \u201cBenny,\u201d who provided officers with information about the source of the drug.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, the driver of the van did not cooperate with the officers' search of the home.  Instead, the complaint alleges, the officers conducted a controlled buy of methamphetamine with the intent to arrest the driver, who was later convicted of conspiracy to possess and distribute the drug with intent to distribute.

Finally, the court granted the SEC's motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 5C1.2(a)(5) and Rule 5a-3 thereunder and ordered the officers to pay a civil penalty of 135 months of imprisonment.
