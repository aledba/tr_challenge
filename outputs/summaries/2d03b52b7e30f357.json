  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Air Liquide Industrial, LLC (\"Air Liquide\"), a California-based company that manufactures and distributes industrial gases.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, on June 3, 2015, Air Liquime's truck driver, Mario Garrido, was hired as a truck driver in June 2009.  As alleged in the complaint, Garrido's employment was not subject to the mandatory arbitration provision of the federal labor code, and he was not required to participate in class-action proceedings.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the federal law does not apply to all workers, and that, as a result of his employment, he could not avoid arbitration.  In its judgment, the court found that, under California law, a class waiver is not required under the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's opinion, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the company to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Gottschall of the United States Court of Appeals for the Northern District of California entered a judgment ordering a temporary restraining order against Garrido and ordering him to comply with the court order.    The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Burt of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper."
