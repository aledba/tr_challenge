  "summary": "On December 19, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana entered a final judgment finding that Michael Leroy Tunis was in direct contempt of court for refusing to testify as a witness in the trial of Samuel Jude Clark (\u201cClark\u201d), despite the trial court's grant of immunity.  According to the court's order, Tunis refused to testify after the court granted him use immunity and derivative use immunity, which prohibits the prosecution from criminally prosecuting the witness for any transaction concerning that to which the witness testifies.  The court also found Tunis in contempt for failing to comply with its order to grant him the right against self-incrimination.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Tunis.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indiana, charges Tunis with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Tunis consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a penalty of 180 days, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On December 20, Tunis was sentenced to 180 days in the Tippecanoe County Jail, which is a 180-day penalty that is reasonable and not inappropriate for a defendant to pay.  As a result of the judgment, Tunis will be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and from participating or practicing in any criminal proceeding.  He also will be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1779 (Dec. 20, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  Investors can also check the background of anyone selling investments using the Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov free and simple search tool.\u00c2\u00a0On January 2, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Tunis, charging him with violations of the securities registration provisions of Sections 35-37-3-1 and 34-47-2-2 (1), and the broker-dealer registration provision of Sections 5(a) and 5(c)"
