  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Eitan Weltman for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in McLean County, Illinois on August 19, 2016, Defendant, a resident of Illinois, incurred a debt for back-due rent and fees, which due to her financial circumstances, she could not pay.  The complaint alleges that Defendant obtained an invalid warrant for her to collect on the debt, which she did not do because she was not provided the opportunity to show cause for why she should not be held in contempt by the court.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Defendant.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains with respect to the relief sought in the civil action.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David J. Biesek and Carol S. Cotter of the Chicago Regional Office, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Kohn. \u00a0The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
