  "summary": "On July 6, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Vermont entered a final judgment against Liana Roy, a Bennington, Vermont woman charged with custodial interference for taking her four-year-old daughter on a two-day trip out of the state without her knowledge.  The court held that, in the absence of a statutory right to appeal, the State had no right to do so.  According to the court's order, filed on July 6 and unsealed on July 7, 2017, the court granted the State's request for extraordinary relief on the basis of the facts of the case, including that the trial court had improperly imposed mandatory minimum sentencing for the defendants, and that the court had erred by imposing sentences below the mandatory minimums.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court order, the state consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains the defendants' rights to appeal.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Roy arising from the same conduct.

It also issued a temporary restraining order preventing the State from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in the securities of any state, including in connection with the issuance of a court order suspending mandatory minimum mandatory-minimum sentencing.  Finally, on July 9, 2017 a federal district court in the District of Columbia entered a judgment against the defendant, finding that the defendant had violated the prerogatives of the federal government to grant extraordinary relief pursuant to Rule 21, and ordering the defendant to pay a penalty equal to the penalty amount to be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC's complaint charges the defendant with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, penny stock bars, and other relief.
