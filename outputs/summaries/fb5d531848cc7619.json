  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a final judgment against defendant Antonio Hill, Jr., who was convicted on May 4, 2015 of two counts of human trafficking of a minor and one count of receiving the earnings of a prostitute.  According to the SEC's complaint, from May 4 to May 5, 2015, Hill and his co-conspirator, Rashid Mosby, lured R.D. out of North Carolina to Washington, D.C., where she was expected to engage in prostitution. Instead, the complaint alleges, as alleged in the complaint, the defendants used a series of false statements to convince the court that they had the right to determine whether to impose separate penalties for the same conduct.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the court did not have the discretion to determine the appropriate amount of time to impose a penalty for each of these violations.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Hill and Mosby violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a) of Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and Rule 17a-1 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and bars him from participating in the sale, purchase, or promotion of any type of adult entertainment, and from associating with any person or organization with whom he has an interest in purchasing or selling a product. The court also granted the SEC a temporary restraining order and ordered Hill to comply with the court's order. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Baltimore Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Rubenstein. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Maryland Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Maryland Office of Financial Regulation."
