  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former business partner who sued his former employer for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 663 of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, Steve Ryan, then a resident of California, filed a motion to vacate a judgment in 2010, claiming he was ill and hospitalized in Mexico when the judgment was issued. The SEC alleges that the court granted the motion for a new trial on the basis that the judgment had been issued after a hearing on the matter had concluded that the motion was appealable. The complaint also alleges that, in 2011, a federal district court in Los Angeles issued an order denying Ryan\u2019s request for a judgment vacating the judgment. The court ruled that the order was not appealable, and that it did not apply to all of the other motions.  The SEC further alleges that in 2013, the court issued a judgment that permanently enjoins Ryan from violating Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Ryan consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any such order. The judgment also ordered Ryan to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Ryan arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On May 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Ryan, charging him with violating Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, Section 13(b)(2) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The Court of Appeals granted the SEC request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against Ryan. In a separate administrative proceeding, the Court of Appeal issued a preliminary injunction against Ryan and ordered him to comply with the court's order that he be barred from appearing before the SEC as an attorney or practicing before the Commission on Civil Procedure. In its order granting the injunction, the Commission found that Ryan was entitled to a separate appeal from the underlying judgment and in a statement superfluous to the opinion. The Commission also found that, contrary to the Commission's finding, Ryan was not entitled to an injunction against violating the charged"
