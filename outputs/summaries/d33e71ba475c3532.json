  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kansas today entered a default judgment against a Kansas mother who was found unfit to parent her children.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kansas City, alleges that, from July 2015 to June 2017, Mother was placed in the temporary custody of the Kansas Department for Children and Families (DCF) for the purpose of recovering the children from her husband's drug use. The complaint alleges that Mother failed to provide sufficient evidence to support her decision to terminate her parental rights. According to the complaint, the court found that Mother violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that she failed to comply with the court's order to terminate the parental rights provision of the federal securities laws. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mother. The SEC also charged Mother with violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0of the Securities Act of 1933.  In its order, the SEC also imposed a temporary restraining order against Mother and ordered her to return to the district court for a hearing scheduled for the third day of the trial. The court granted the SEC's request for a final judgment against Mother, ordering her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing a civil penalty of $75,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, John R. Rymas, and Amy C. McKinley of the SEC Enforcement Division's Kansas Division of Child and Family Education. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. McKinly. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Health and Human Services, the Kansas Secretary of State's Office, and the Kansas Attorney General's Office in this matter."
