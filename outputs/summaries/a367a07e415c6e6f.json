  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Darcy Dean Racus, a former state trooper who was convicted of attempted first degree rape of a child and communicating with a minor for immoral purposes.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Racus violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Racus also alleges that the SEC improperly recorded conversations between Racus and a fictitious mother who had been arrested as part of a sting operation by the Washington State Patrol Missing and Exploited Children Task Force.  According to the complaint, Racus responded to an advertisement on Craigslist for adult women who wanted to have sex with a child. Racus replied to the ad by saying, \u201cI just moved here and looking for a close family connection.\u201d Racus then allegedly engaged in a series of e-mails and text messages with the mother, asking her daughter if she would like to have oral sex with her child. The complaint further alleges that during closing argument Racus told the mother that he would like her daughter to \"have a pic\" and that she would be appalled at that thought.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Racus.  On December 17, 2015, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an emergency court order freezing Racus\u2019 assets and ordering him to return to duty on January 2, 2020. The SEC also issued an order freezing the assets of Racus in a parallel criminal case. The court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the asset freeze and other emergency relief to be obtained by the court.  A hearing is scheduled for January 24, 2020, for which the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the New York Office of Inspector General."
