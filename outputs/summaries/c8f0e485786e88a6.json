  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against two men accused of orchestrating a series of high-profile slayings.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento on May 21, 1990, alleges that James David Beck, a California resident, and his brother, Jason W. Beck, of Oakdale, California, entered a house in Salida, Calif., where Beck, Beck, and Beck were living. Beck allegedly told Beck and Beck that he was going to kill them and that he would use a \"kite\" to hit them. The complaint also alleges that Beck told Beck that one of his brothers had been shot in the head and had been kicked out of the family home. Beck also allegedly told Cruz that he had been hit in the back of the head by Raper, and that Raper had been arrested and taken into custody. According to the complaint, Beck and Cruz continued to threaten each other, telling Beck to \"put your clothes on the ground\" and \"let\u2019s get ready to go out there and get some sleep.\" Beck allegedly threatened to kill Raper and others, including his half-sister, Donna Alvarez, and another woman he met at the same time. Beck and Vieira also allegedly engaged in a verbal tussle with one of the men in the group. The SEC alleges that the two men were in possession of a.380-caliber handgun, which they used to carry out the murders.  Beck, Cruz, Vieira, and LaMarsh allegedly used the gun to commit the murders, and Cruz and Beck used it to hit another man in the face and kick him in the stomach.  In a parallel criminal case, the U. S. Attorney\u2018s Office for Central California today unsealed criminal charges and issued an asset freeze against Beck and others in connection with the case.  On May 22, 2017, the SEC filed criminal charges in the case against Beck.
