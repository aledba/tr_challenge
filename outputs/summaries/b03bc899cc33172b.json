  "summary": "On July 19, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oregon entered a final judgment in favor of the city of Portland and Columbia Pacific, Oregon, in a civil injunctive action.  The court found that the proposed amendments violated the dormant Commerce Clause of the federal securities laws.  According to the court's order, the city and the Columbia Pacific Building Trades Council (BCTC) raised the issue of whether the amendments violate the dormant commerce clause by failing to adequately consider the risks of the location of fossil-fuel terminals in an earthquake-prone region.  BCTC also found that, contrary to BCTC's opinion, the amendments did not violate any of the above-mentioned provisions.  In addition, the court ruled that BCTC violated Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, BCTC and BCTC have consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin BCTC from violating these provisions. BCTC has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.  Columbia Pacific agreed to settle the case against it by consenting to a judgment that permanently restrains BCTC, and requires BCTC to comply with the proposed final judgments. The settlement is subject to court approval. The court also granted BCTC a temporary restraining order and an order requiring it to conduct an independent review of its proposed final judgment. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Oregon Department of Commerce, and the Oregon Secretary of State's Office in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
