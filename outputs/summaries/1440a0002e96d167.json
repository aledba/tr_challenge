  "summary": "On May 24, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia entered a temporary restraining order against Mark Thorp, who is charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington D.C., Thorp alleges that, in 2015, the District Attorney's Office issued tax summonses to twelve entities related to his nightclub business. The summonses, as alleged in the complaint, were issued for the purpose of obtaining tax records related to Thorp's business. As alleged, however, the summonses were issued solely to corporate entities. The complaint alleges that Thorp failed to show any reasonable likelihood of success in the court-ordered enforcement of these summonses.  The SEC's Complaint, filed under seal on May 24 and unsealed on June 3, 2018 in the U District Court in the District, charges Thorp with violations of the federal securities laws. The SEC seeks a preliminary injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. Thorp has also agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Department today announced criminal charges against Thorp arising from the same conduct that led to his earlier action.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Thorp consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering him to comply with the court's order, and appointing an independent receiver to oversee the collection of tax information. The court also granted Thorp the right to a hearing on the merits of the case.  On June 5, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions, and an order requiring Thorp to pay civil penalties of $150,000 or more. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC encourages investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by\u00c2\u00a0using\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov\u00c2\u00a0To\u00c2\u00a0find\u00c2\u00a0proof of"
