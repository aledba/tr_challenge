  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Town of Tyre in favor of the casino project.  According to the court's order, on September 24, 2015, the town issued a negative declaration for the Lago Resort & Casino project, which was supposed to be completed by October 1, 2015.  The court found that the Town failed in many ways in issuing its negative declaration, including failing to make a reasoned elaboration on the potential impact of the project on the town's agricultural resources and land, and failing to take the requisite \"hard look\" at the project's potential to attract a large number of people to the town for more than a few days.  As alleged in the complaint, the Town's negative declaration was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion in issuing the negative declaration.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the town improperly relied on Lago's proposed mitigation measures, including those stated in the Community Mitigation Plan (CMP) and the Town Board's January 2015 negative declaration in issuing an EIS.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Lago agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Town from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Lago to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Lago has also agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, with the amount of disgorgement to be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the parties.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the New York Office of the Secretary of State's Office and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and is being supervised by Marc Blau. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Environmental Quality, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
