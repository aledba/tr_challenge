  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a New York-based company and its co-defendant in a securities fraud case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, from at least 2013 through at least 2016, New York residents and putative class members purchased Nellie's Free Range Eggs, falsely claiming that the eggs were \"sourced from small farms providing all chickens with space to move around both indoors and outdoors.\"  According to the complaint, however, the defendants did not allege that they purchased the eggs because they believed that they had access to the outdoors.  Instead, the complaint alleges that the defendants' hens were crammed \"into sheds up to 20,000 at a time\" preventing them from extending their wings, foraging, and making their way to the outdoor space.  In addition, as alleged in the SEC's Complaint, defendants misrepresented to the public that their hens had \"space\" to move freely between indoor and outdoor spaces.  For example, the SEC alleges that defendants failed to disclose to the non-New York residents that they bought the eggs based on \"expert resume critiques\" that were followed immediately in the same document by advertisements, which made it abundantly clear that the defendant was attempting to sell the eggs in an open field.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC complaint, Defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Additionally, the court granted a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the federal securities laws, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Donnelly of the New York District Court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Defendants from violating these provisions, and orders them to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   The court also granted a preliminary injunction against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 and orders the defendants not to violate the securities registration provisions of Sections 13(a)(1) and 13(b)(5) and (3) thereunder of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13b2-3, and 13b5-11 thereunder. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J.
