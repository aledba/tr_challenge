  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an emergency court order halting the deportations of more than 100 Cambodian citizens.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that Mony Neth, a Cambodian citizen, was unlawfully detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in October 2017.  According to the complaint, Neth and his family were among the first to be repatriated to the United States from Cambodia, and were subsequently ordered to return to their countries of origin.  Neth's family members were among those repatriated, and Neth was one of the last to be released from custody.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security today announced that it has obtained a temporary restraining order and an order suspending Neth from appearing before the court as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the court granted the court's order and ordered Neth to comply with the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The court also granted the request for a temporary injunction, which is subject to court approval.  On January 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court of Appeals for the Central District of California granted the Court's order suspending the expedited entry of the final judgment and ordering the court to determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion of the court.  A hearing on February 5, 2018 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 5, 2019.  Separately, the SEC filed an emergency action on January 26, 2018 against Neth for violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20 thereunder and for aiding and abetting his violations of Section 1252(c).  The Court granted the emergency action against Sansone and Sansone, and ordered the return of all of the defendants to the court at a later date.   The case is being handled by Jennifer C. Barry, David A. Cohen, and Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office."
