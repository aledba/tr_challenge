  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Lee Freyer Kennedy Crestview, LLC, a Florida-based real estate developer, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Biel REO, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Crestview LLC, failed to adequately disclose to the court that it was liable under the provisions of the federal securities laws for certain of the loans and guaranty agreements. The complaint further alleges that, in addition to the Florida judgments, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims that they were not liable for the loans or guaranty, and that they did not have the requisite expertise to deal with the issues raised in the complaint. In addition, the SEC alleges that none of the defendants had ever been named as a party in the Florida litigation and that, as a result of their delay, the defendants were not personally liable for any of the fees they had incurred. The SEC also found that, among other things, that Kennedy was not liable under Rule 17a-1 because she had been a developer for fifteen years and that she was very experienced in dealing with banks and borrowing money.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Kennedy.  On May 10, 2013, the trial court granted an unopposed motion to dismiss from the Florida case, finding that the defendant had not been a party to any Florida judgments and that he was not entitled to a second judgment on the same note for the same amount. The trial court also ruled that the Kennedy Defendants had waived this issue because they had made no real challenge at trial as to the interest calculations made by Biel ReO. The court further ruled that, based on the facts of the case, the defendant could not be held liable by the court for the amount of any defaulted principal or interest owed by LFK Crestview and Kennedy, and therefore could not proceed with a judgment against the defendant.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Biel and Crestview consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (d) and 17a of the securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest thereon. The judgment also orders Biel to pay civil penalties of $1,000,000 and $750,000"
