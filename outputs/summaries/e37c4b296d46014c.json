  "summary": "On January 4, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the National Park Service (NPS) in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, alleges that NPS violated the antifraud provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by reallocating the unused shuttle service transportation events among existing concessioners in a closed process.  According to the complaint, in 2013, NPS issued a Prospectus soliciting offers for the use of the unused transportation events for the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 winter seasons.  As alleged in the Prospectus, the reallocation of the transportation events was not a material change to the concessioner's contract and was instead a reasonable extension of the services already offered under the contract.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, based on the nature of the alleged violations, the Reallocation was a \"minor additional visitor service\" that did not violate the APA.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the NPS has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws, orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders a temporary restraining order against NPS.  NPS also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorging that it will pay in the civil penalty.  On January 5, 2018 the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Court of Appeals granted the Commission's motion for summary judgment, ordering the Commission to consider whether or not to grant the Commission the right to determine whether and how to proceed with the litigation.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by M. Todd Winter and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry in the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Winter and Ms. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Wyoming Department of Natural Resources, and the Wyoming Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
