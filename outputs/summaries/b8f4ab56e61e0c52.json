  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against two New Hartford residents who were charged with lying to the federal government in connection with an application to build a driveway across wetlands on their property.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Hartford, Connecticut, alleges that on July 2, 2014, the Connecticut Department of Natural Resources (DNR) filed an application with the Commission seeking a permit for a residential development on the property. The complaint alleges that the Commission improperly reviewed the record for substantial evidence in support of its finding that there was no reasonable and prudent alternative to the proposed activity. The Commission's finding, however, was implicit in its decision, and the Commission failed to consider whether there were other feasible and prudent alternatives. The SEC alleges that, in its judgment, the Commission found that the applicant had failed to show that there were any reasonable or prudent alternatives to the planned activity. In addition, the court found that, contrary to the Commission's findings, the applicant failed to demonstrate that the proposed activities would have no or de minimis impact on the function of the wetlands resources. The court also ruled that the defendants failed to provide sufficient evidence to justify their actions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Connecticut today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  According to the SEC's order, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) thereunder of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. The order also prohibits the Commission from issuing or selling any security deposit or other security deposit in the name of a federal agency.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,038, and prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,037, and orders them not to violate the antiligence provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (d) of DNR, and to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the Commission. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019).  The Commission has agreed to a permanent injunction against future violations of the antigay provisions, to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and a $50,000 civil penalty. The settlements are subject"
