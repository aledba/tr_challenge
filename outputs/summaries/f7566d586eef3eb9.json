  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Philip Morris USA, Inc. (\"Philip Morris\"), a New York-based manufacturer of cigarettes, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida on November 6, 2018, Philip Morris and its co-defendant, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Inc., raised the issue of whether the defendants had engaged in a massive and effective disinformation campaign, aimed at instilling false doubt about the health effects of cigarettes and the addictive nature of nicotine. The complaint alleges that the defendants, for decades, engaged in advertising campaigns aimed at attracting young smokers, while intentionally deceiving the public about the dangers of smoking. The SEC alleges that, in reality, the defendants were perpetuating in the courtroom the same disinformation campaign that gave rise to Mrs. Berger\u2019s COPD.  The SEC also alleges that Philip Morris misrepresented to the jury that smoking was not a serious health problem and that the companies had no intention of causing her to quit.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay $20,760,000.14 in disgorgement and $6.25 million in prejudgment interest, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  To learn more about the federal criminal laws, see Litigation Release No. 13-cv-01-17 (Dec. 6, 2016).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
