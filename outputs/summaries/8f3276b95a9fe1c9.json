  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was arrested without bail on a charge of murder in the first degree.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Springfield, Massachusetts, alleges that, on January 5, 2015, a Springfield, Mass., bail judge denied the defendant's request to be held without bail.  According to the complaint, the bail judge ignored the fact that the defendant had lived in Massachusetts for twenty years, had four daughters and a grandson living in Massachusetts, and had been convicted of a prior felony.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the judge ignored evidence presented by the victim's family, friends, and community members, and failed to consider the risk of flight when granting bail to the defendant.  As a result, the judge's decision to grant bail was based on the strength of the Commonwealth's case and the potential penalty of a sentence to life in prison.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the bail provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of life imprisonment, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The judgment also prohibits the defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a bail order, and prohibits him from associating with any broker dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, or registered investment adviser. The court granted the defendant a temporary restraining order and ordered him to surrender his passport.  On December 14, 2017, a federal judge in Springfield granted the bail defendant's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered the defendant to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty of $10,000.  A hearing scheduled for May 24, 2018, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  An SEC examination that followed the same examination that led to the discovery of the evidence in the case was conducted in the Office of the United States District Judge in the Boston Regional Office. The examination was conducted by Michael J. Brangan and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Massachusetts Department of Justice in this matter."
