  "summary": "The Arizona Department of Economic Security (ADES) today announced that it has terminated the services of a six-year-old Arizona child with a severe, severe developmental disability.  According to the SEC's complaint, A.W. was born in late 2009 with several chronic complications resulting in extensive medical needs.  The complaint alleges that, from at least 2009 through at least June 2017, ADES terminated DDD services to a six year-old child with an Autism diagnosis.  As alleged in the complaint, the ADES' May 1, 2017 Notice, which was filed in the Arizona Administrative Law Judge's Office, stated that the child had a \"strongly demonstrated potential\" to participate in developmental disabilities services, including learning disabilities, visual and fine motor coordination delays or limitations and a neurodevelopmental chromosomal syndrome known as DUP 15Q.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the AdES' complaint, however, the complaint alleges ADES violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  ADES has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins it from violating these provisions.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Arizona today announced criminal charges against ADES.   The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using\u00c2\u00a0an investor's\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov account. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Hoke and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Arizona Office of the Inspector General.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. Hove and Ms. Gibson."
