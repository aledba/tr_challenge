  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered final judgments against Peabody Energy Corporation and its affiliates in a reorganization case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, the Debtors filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  The complaint alleges that, in April 2016, the Honorable Judge Paul J. Conrrad of the U.N. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan issued a final judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay $750 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On December 22, 2016, a federal court in Manhattan granted the defendants a temporary restraining order and ordered them to comply with the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief, and ordering the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Office of Financial Regulation, and the New Jersey Office of the Secretary of State's Office."
