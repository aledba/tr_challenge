  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Missouri man who was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, alleges that, on May 13, 2015, a jury found that Father had engaged in incest with S.S., a sister born in January, 2004, and that, at the advice of his attorney, he should not have his parental rights terminated because of the fact that the jury could not have reasonably found, from the record at trial, the existence of the challenged finding.  According to the complaint, however, Father did not participate in services and did not testify at trial because of his pending criminal case.  In a parallel action, on April 9, 2019, the same day the jury found Father liable for violating Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206 thereunder, Father was ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Father consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and a $20,000 officer and director bar. The court also granted Father a temporary restraining order prohibiting him from participating in any services or testimony at trial.  On May 16, 2020, the date of the trial on this matter, the court granted Father's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 206, and ordered him to comply with the court's order.  Father agreed to settle the case by consenting to a hearing in which he agreed to be permanently enjoined from violations of the charged provisions of Sections 206 and 211, and to a conduct-based injunction against further violations of those provisions.  He also agreed to a four-year delay in having the no contact order modified by the criminal court in such a way as to facilitate his reunification efforts with his daughter.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Father failed to show sufficient evidence to support the finding, and, in the alternative, to show that a fact-finder in a civil case had the discretion to draw a negative inference against him due to the nature of the evidence presented by the trial court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January, 2004).  The complaint charges Father with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(3) of"
