  "summary": "On May 4, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine entered a final judgment against Maine's Secretary of State for the State of Maine for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Maine, alleges that the Maine Republican Party violated the registration and qualification requirements of the federal election laws.  According to the complaint, the Commission for Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV) requires political parties to select their nominees by a majority of the party's primary voters. The Commission alleges that, under the RCV, a party's right to participate in the selection of its nominee is central to its right to freedom of association.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's allegations, the Maine GOP Party consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the Commission from violating the registration, qualification, and pre-clearance provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(d) of The Commission's Rules of Practice, and orders the Commission to issue an order imposing a preliminary injunction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against the Commission, which is investigating whether the Commission violated the federal securities laws, including the securities registration and preclearance provision of Section 5(b).  The Commission has also issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the SEC's investigation of the matter.  On June 12, 2018 the Commission issued its final judgment, ordering Maine to adopt a ranked-choice voting system, which it has not yet implemented, requiring that all of its nominees be selected by a plurality of votes.  It also ordered Maine to comply with a federal court order requiring it to implement a single-party system in primary and general elections.  To comply with this order, Maine has agreed to the appointment of a receiver, which will determine the number of candidates eligible to vote in the primary election.  For further information, see Commission on Ranked Choice Voting and Rule 206(1) and (2) the Commission on Participatory and Non-Partisan Education and Advocacy, which has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission also issued a\u00c2\u00a0Notice\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0the Commission has issued\u00c2\u00a0an\u00c2\u00a0Order\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0Complaint\u00c2\u00a0requiring\u00c2\u00a0against violations of the\u00c2\u00a0Federal Voting Rules\u00c2\u00a0\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7"
