  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Minnesota today entered a final judgment against a Minnesota-based church building preservation organization for which it was named as a defendant.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Cloud, Minnesota, alleges that the Church of St. Mary, Melrose, and its owner, Donald J. Kettler, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17(b)(2) thereunder.  According to the complaint, the church building was gutted in a fire in March 2016. The church building is no longer usable for any parish activities. The complaint alleges that, in a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for Minnesota announced criminal charges against the church.  In a related administrative proceeding, the Minnesota Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an order freezing the assets of the church and denying the SEC's request for an asset freeze. The court also issued a temporary restraining order halting the destruction of the building and ordering the church to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. The SEC also issued an order suspending the construction of a new church building, which is subject to approval by the court.  On August 29, 2018, the Honorable Rebecca M. Pfeil of the Minnesota Court of Appeals issued a preliminary injunction against any alteration or destruction of any church building. The order temporarily enjoins the church from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders the building to be rehabilitated and converted into a single-family residence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Pfeill consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and appointing a liturgical consultant to be retained by the church as a relief defendant. The final judgment also prohibits the destruction or alteration of any existing church building in the name of the state, including the building that was deemed to be a \"historical resource\" by the Minnesota Office of the Secretary of State. In its order, the court also ordered that the church be demolished in a manner that is consistent with and appropriate for the protection of the public health, safety, and welfare in light of the historic preservation of the buildings. The district court agreed to the settlement of the SEC&rsquo;s charges without admitting or denied the allegations of the complaint. The settlement is subject"
