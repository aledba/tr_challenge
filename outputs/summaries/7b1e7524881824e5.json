  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today entered a default judgment against Asfaneh Azadeh for her role in the alleged torture she suffered during a three-month detention in an Iranian jail.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 18, 2016 in the United States district court for the district of Columbia, as part of a civil action against Iran and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard (IRG) for her alleged involvement in an act of torture that caused a United States national \"personal injury or death\" during her three months in prison in Evin Prison, Iran.  The complaint alleges that, in her capacity as an attorney and as a result of her failure to comply with the requirements of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) and the court's order requiring her to apply for service under the FSIA, she was repeatedly \"beat, whipped, threatened, and intimidated\" by IRG members during the three months she spent wrongfully imprisoned in the Iranian jail, and she was also \"poisoned and forced to take \u2018truth pills\u2019 on a daily basis.\u201d  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting the issuance of a final judgment against the IRG, which is subject to court approval.  In its order, the court also issued a temporary restraining order, which temporarily halted the issuance and issuance of the final judgment on the matter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the Court has also issued an order suspending Azadah from appearing or practicing before the Commission on Foreign Affairs, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $13,028,889, a $5,176,733 civil penalty, and a $18,205,622 officer-and-director bar.  On March 22, 2017, Judge Harvey granted the request for a preliminary injunction and entered a final order suspending the issuance, issuance, and director-of-officer bar from serving as a relief defendant under the federal securities laws.  Separately, on March 24, 2018, a federal district court in Brooklyn, N.Y., entered an order granting the request to proceed with service by mail under Section 1608(a)(4).  The court also granted the court the right to determine whether to issue an order permanently enjoining the defendants from violating the charged provisions of the securities laws, ordering the issuance or issuance of any final judgment as to the parties, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. McCole and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office."
