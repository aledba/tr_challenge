  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the California Department of Justice and the California Office of Inspector General in a related case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, alleges that the California Secretary of State's Office issued an order requiring the release of documents containing information about the development, operation, or maintenance of a public record.  According to the complaint, the order required the disclosure of the information in a GIS file format, a format that includes computer programs and computer graphics systems.  In addition, the court found that the exemption for GIS-formatted databases does not apply to computer software, and that it is not required by the federal law.  As a result of the court's order, the federal government is prohibited from providing information to the public in the form of a \"public record\" under the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the California Attorney General's Office today filed a civil injunctive action against the county, the Department of Finance, and the County of Orange County, charging the county with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 6254.9 of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder.  For further information, see Press Release No. 6253.9, June 15, 1988, (C.Rptr.3d).  The Court of Appeal also issued a temporary restraining order against the issuance of the order, freezing the assets of the County, and ordering the county to pay a civil penalty of $100,000.   The court also ordered the County to comply with an order appointing an independent auditor to review the books and records of public agencies and determine whether there is sufficient evidence to determine whether to issue an order imposing a civil injunction against the issuing of any such order.  Finally, the District Attorney's Office filed an emergency action on June 22, 2008, against the County for violating the same conduct-based reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) that led to the Commission's finding that the County violated Section 5(b)(2) and (c) and Rule 5a-3 thereunder of the Commission on Audit and Rule 13a-11 thereunder and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and Detection of Fraudulent Business Practices. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John R. Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0"
