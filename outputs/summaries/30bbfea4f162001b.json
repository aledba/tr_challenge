  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Dow Chemical Company, Inc. (\"Dow\"), a medical device company, and its former chief executive officer, John R. Rymas, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, filed on June 4, 2004, the court found that all first-priority payments were virtually guaranteed and authorized the issuance of a $100.4 million cushion over the course of a sixteen-year period ending June 2019.  The court also found that, based on the independent Assessor\u2019s projections, the cushion was virtually guaranteed.  In fact, according to the complaint, the Independent Assessor had always relied on conservative assumptions and so consistently overstated the number of successful claims.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Dow has agreed to settle its breast-implant claims through a $1.95 billion settlement facility or litigating them against a $400 million litigation facility. The settlement facility is open to any of the more than 100,000 people who submitted proof of claim during the bankruptcy proceedings, and the complaint alleges that the settlement agreement requires as a default that all base payments are made before any second-priority payment is made.  Dow has also agreed to pay a $50,000 civil penalty, which is equal to disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On June 6, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action against Dow alleging that it violated Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") by failing to adequately assess the safety and efficacy of the settlement facility, and that Dow had violated Section 13(b)(5) and 13(a)(2) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder, and to pay $150,000 in disgorge interest, which would be equal to the total amount of first priority payments received in the facility.  As a result, the complaint charges Dow with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and (e) of Securities Act Section 10, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgements of ill, and civil penalties against Dow.  To settle, Dow consented to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorg"
