  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against a former employee of Virginia-based eDiscovery and legal staffing firm Advanced Marine Enterprises, Inc.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that Lawrence Samilow violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the Commission found that defendants violated the non-solicitation and non-compete provisions of the federal securities laws, and that the Commission's order to impose a temporary restraining order and a civil injunctive relief order violated Section 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(c)(3)(B).  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission, defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the Virginia Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against defendant for violating the anti-fraud provision of Section 12(b).  The Commission also issued an order temporarily suspending the sale of securities in the securities industry, freezing the assets of defendants, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge William G. Donnelly of the U. S. District court for the Southern District of New York granted the Commission the right to request an asset freeze and other emergency relief, including an order suspending the issuance of an officer-and-director bar, and ordering the Commission to conduct an independent examination of the SEC's securities laws. The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Commonwealth of Virginia's Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Virginia Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 10, 2018).  For additional information on how to apply for a court-ordered asset freeze, see SEC v. Kelly, No. 10-cr-101 (January 13, 2013)."
