  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut today entered a final judgment against a former state employee who was denied certain spousal retirement benefits.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that Walter Walenski, a former employee of the Connecticut Department of Public Works, was improperly denied certain of his retirement benefits in accordance with the State Employees Retirement Act.  According to the complaint, Walter, who retired from state employment in 1989, made a decision to elect a retirement benefit option in which he would retain his or her own pension free and clear of any claims from the other party.  As alleged, the Commission denied Walter's request for a hearing on July 14, 2015, and on October 20, 2016, Judge Huddleston, J., issued an order requiring the Commission to consider the merits of the Commission's findings.  In a parallel action, the Connecticut Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has filed an emergency action to expedite the filing of an administrative proceeding against Walter.  On November 2, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Walter, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Walter consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and requires him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Walter also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar, with the right to reapply after he has exhausted all of his administrative remedies.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-155a (a) and Litigation Alert No. 17-cv-17 (b) (2014).  The Commission's complaint charges Walter with violating Sections 5-166 (1), (2), (3), and (4) (A), and with aiding and abetting violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and (c) thereunder of the Administrative Procedure Act of 1940, and the Commission with violating Section 5-157 of the Investment Advisers Act and Rule 5b2-3 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  It also seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations of the securities laws and an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver"
