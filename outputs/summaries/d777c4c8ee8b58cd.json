  "summary": "On November 15, 2016, a Benton County Circuit Court jury convicted appellant, Mauricio Alejandro Torres, of capital murder and first-degree battery in the death of his six-year-old son Maurice \u201cIsaiah\u201d Torres. The court found that Torres was not guilty of the two charges and instead was sentenced to death on the basis of failure to prove the underlying felony of the alleged rape.  According to the court's order, Torres consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rules 10b-5, 13a-14, and 13b-1 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $15,000.  The court also granted Torres's motion for a new trial.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Torres arising from the same conduct alleged in the second case.  As set forth in the SEC's complaint, Torres is entitled to separate jury instructions for the affirmative defense to felony murder that appropriately allocate the burden of proof, and to the imposition of a penalty that is not simply factually insufficient.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the court has agreed to a permanent injunction against Torres from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in violation of the charged provision of the securities laws.  Torres has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On December 5, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Kerstetter of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas granted Torres' request for a temporary restraining order, ordered him to surrender his passport, and issued an order suspending him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.
