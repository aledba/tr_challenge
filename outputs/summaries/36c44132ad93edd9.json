  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Vermont today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to pay a $400 fine, six months of probation, and a $100,000 civil penalty.  In its order, the court also ordered the defendant to submit to random urinalysis and drug screening.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Vermont, defendant had been previously convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol in 2005 and had been suspended for more than twelve years for driving while impaired by drugs. The court found that defendant had no history of drug or alcohol use and had no prior felony convictions.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, imposes a five-year probation condition, and requires him to attend a safe-driving class for impaired drivers. The order also prohibits him from purchasing or using any regulated drugs unless he has had a prior felony conviction for that conduct, and orders him to comply with a court order requiring him to do so. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant. The SEC's complaint, filed on December 1, 2017, charges defendant with violating Section 5 of the\u00c2\u00a0Securities Act and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The complaint also seeks a conduct-based injunction against future violations and a permanent restraining order against defendant and his family.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5989909 (July 24, 2014).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Vermont Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Vermont State Office of Health and Human Services in this matter."
