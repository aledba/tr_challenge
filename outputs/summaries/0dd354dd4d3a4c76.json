  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Allen Peithman, Jr. and Sharon A. Elder of Lincoln, Nebraska, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Lincoln, alleges that, between October 2013 and May 2015, the defendants engaged in a multi-level scheme to sell \"potpourri,\" a product containing synthetic marijuana.  According to the complaint, the scheme involved the sale of a variety of misbranded drugs, including, but not limited to, the manufacture, sale of, and purchase of marijuana. The complaint alleges that Peithmans and Elder knew or should have known that the drug was being sold at Island Smokes, but instead chose to purchase it from out-of-state suppliers in violation of federal law.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 17, 2018, the U.N. District Judge for the Northern District of Nebraska entered a judgment against Peithmann, ordering him to pay a total of $1,142,942.32 plus prejudgment interest of $2,025,288.75 and a civil penalty of $5,186.56.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's case, the Defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of $3,192,078.32 with prejudgment interests of $7,865,072.32, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $117,653.57 and a $10,000,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.
