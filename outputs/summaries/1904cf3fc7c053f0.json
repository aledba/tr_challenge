  "summary": "On June 24, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin entered a final judgment against the United States Attorney General and other federal authorities for their roles in the alleged illegal entry of an illegal immigrant.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, from mid-1990 through late 2006, the Nepali Congress, a political party that he describes as supporting nationalism, democracy, socialism, and nonviolence, was targeted by the Maoist party and began targeting its opposition, including his family. The complaint further alleges that the Department of Homeland Security issued a final denial of Mr. Dhakal\u2019s asylum claim in August 2013, two months after his entry. The court found that the Director of the Chicago Asylum Office had not completed his review of the asylum claim and therefore could not determine whether to grant him asylum. The Court also found that, as a result of the Director's denial, he was not entitled to relief under the APA, as he had exhausted all administrative remedies available to him, including the right to reapply for asylum at either the affirmative or defensive stage of the immigration proceedings. The final judgment, which was entered on the merits of the case, permanently enjoins the Defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the Defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the Court also denied the Defendants\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the Defendants, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty. The SEC also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and the case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, U.K. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement."
