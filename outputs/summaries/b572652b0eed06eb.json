  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida today entered a final judgment in favor of GEICO General Insurance Company, a Florida-based insurance company, in a first-party bad faith action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that Ethel Cousin was injured in a car accident in which she and her husband sustained serious injuries. According to the complaint, Cousin reported the accident to GEICO, who also insured Bratcher, claiming injuries to her leg, knee, neck, and shoulder. The complaint alleges that Cousin's lawyer delayed GEICO\u2019s efforts to conduct a meaningful independent review of her claim before the deadline. The SEC alleges that, in handling her UM claim, GEICO acted in bad faith by failing to timely provide medical records and medical bills and by repeatedly canceling and refusing to submit to an IME prior to his threatened deadline for serving the lawsuit on her.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the SEC has agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins GEICO from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the company to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In its order, the court also ordered GEICO to pay a civil penalty of $14,104, which is equal to the amount of the alleged damages received in the complaint. The court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the company, and imposing a $5,135.00 civil penalty against Cousin.  On November 2, the district court granted the SEC a preliminary injunction against future violations of Section 624.155, which requires the SEC to conduct an independent, cost-benefit analysis of the claims before they can be filed with the court. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced parallel criminal charges against GEICO.  A hearing for the SEC is scheduled for March 5, 2019.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner, Ms. Brunson, and Ms. Werner. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Florida Department of Insurance in this matter."
