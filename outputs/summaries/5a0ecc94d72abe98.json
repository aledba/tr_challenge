  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of South Dakota today announced criminal charges against Justin Morales and Chase Guzman.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, alleges that Morales and Guzman violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Morales, Guzman, and the other co-conspirator allegedly used social media to solicit the purchase of approximately four ounces of methamphetamine from Morales. The complaint further alleges that Guzman and Morales agreed to settle the charges by agreeing to be permanently enjoined from violating the federal securities laws and to pay a penalty equal to the amount of their illegal sales.  Morales also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Morales, ordering him to pay $5,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Morales consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and provides that the court shall determine whether to impose a penalty based on reasonable suspicion.  Guzman agreed to the settlement without admitting the allegations in the complaint. The court also granted the SEC\u2019s request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, and ordered Guzman to comply with the court order.  On August 2, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the U. S. District Court in the Southern Division entered a judgment ordering a permanent injunction against future violations, ordering a conduct-based injunction, and imposing a $5 million civil penalty against Morales.  A hearing scheduled for September 22, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Missouri Department of Banking and Securities and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
