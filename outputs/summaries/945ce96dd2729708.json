  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Willie Triplett, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 14 years in prison for burglary of a church following a jury trial in the Neshoba County District Court.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on August 31, 2016, Triplett was arrested without a warrant and without probable cause on September 7, 2016. The complaint alleges that Triplett made a false confession to a member of the Choctaw Indian Reservation, telling the officer that he had just tried to pawn a Mantis tiller. Triplett also allegedly claimed that he was high when he confessed, that he told Sciple that he \"did it\" and that he would \"take the blame\" for the burglary even though he \"didn't do it.\" The complaint further alleges that the jury found Triplett guilty of the same felony as he was convicted of, and he was subsequently sentenced to fourteen years in the custody of the Department of Corrections.  The SEC's Complaint against Triplett charges him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against triplett.  On September 5, 2017, the SEC filed an emergency action and obtained a temporary restraining order, ordering Triplett to surrender his passport, and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The SEC also obtained an emergency court order freezing Triplett's assets, including his car, and imposing a $500,000 conduct-related injunction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC Complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders him not to participate in any future securities offerings. The court also granted the SEC the right to conduct a parallel criminal investigation.  To learn more about this matter, see SEC Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Aug. 30, 2016)."
