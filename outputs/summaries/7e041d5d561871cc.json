  "summary": "On May 23, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky entered a final judgment against Matthew L. Matthews, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to twelve years in prison for a second-degree robbery and attempted murder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky, Matthews and his co-defendant, Anthony L. Ball, were jointly indicted on charges of complicity to commit both first- and third-degree robberies and attempted murders. The SEC alleges that Ball and Ball falsely claimed to be hybrid counsel when, in fact, they were not hybrid counsel. Instead, the court instructed Ball to use his own self-representation to convince the jury that he was a reasonable person to represent himself at a separate trial. The court also instructed Ball not to cross-examine his attorney and to refrain from making statements that were inconsistent with the facts of the case.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Ball.  The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Ball, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Ball consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The judgment also prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any security or other security measure. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (Feb. 26, 2019).  The U. S. Attorney's office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today announced parallel criminal charges.  On May 24, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court against Matthews, alleging that he acted as hybrid counsel in violation of the securities laws. The complaint also alleges that Matthews violated the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and (3) of The Securities Act, Section 15(b)(5) and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. The case was investigated by the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit and the Kentucky Office of Professional and Risk Analysis and Detection and Detection Center."
