  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former supervisor of International Paper Company (IPC) who allegedly engaged in a hostile work environment.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Johnnie McDowell violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, McDowell repeatedly asked Ray to engage in sexual activity with him and asked her to show him her \"cootie,\" \"cha-cha,\" and \"monkey\" comments that Ray construed as requests to see her genitals.  McDowell allegedly continued this conduct despite Ray\u2019s repeatedly refusing to participate in the work.  Ray also allegedly complained to a different supervisor, Benjamin Owens, for the beginning of her shift, and to another supervisor, Derrick Smith, who confronted McDowell about his conduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Ray consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued a temporary restraining order against McDowell, ordering him to return to his duties as a supervisor, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the New York District Court entered a judgment ordering a permanent injunction, ordering McDowell to comply with the court order, and ordering the company to pay a $20,000 penalty, ordering Ray to pay an $8,500 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000, and prohibiting McDowell from participating in any type of disciplinary proceeding.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (March 21, 2018).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the SEC Investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.
