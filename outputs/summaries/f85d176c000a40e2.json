  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Jeremy Keith Sharrow, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to prison for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also issued a temporary restraining order against Sharrow and ordered him to pay a $500 fine and $250 in restitution.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in Atlanta on Dec. 24, 2015, Sharrow pleaded guilty to one felony and was subsequently sentenced to imprisonment for a total of five years.  In its judgment, the court found that Sharrow had violated his probation by failing to make sufficient bona fide efforts to comply with a nonpayment condition of probation, and that he was entitled to imprisonment following the revocation of probation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in Bearden's opinion, the Court held that, as a matter of law, a defendant has the right to revoke his probation and impose a penalty that is reasonable and fair.  It also ruled that, based on the nature of the alleged violation, the penalty should be based on a reasonable basis, not on a lack of financial means.  Sharrow's sentencing hearing was scheduled for Jan. 5, 2013, for which the court granted the probation officer's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, ordered Sharrow to pay $5,855 in restitution, and imposed a four-year deferred judgment and probation with a penalty of imprisonment for five months.  On Jan. 6, 2014, the trial court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Sharrow from violating the probation revocation provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(d) and imposes a five-year prison sentence on him.  As a result of the judgment, Bearden will be barred from serving any prison term and will be prohibited from participating in any probation revocation proceeding.  For further information, see People v. Bearden, 2016, No. 13CA1164, (Colo. App. 1997).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Atlanta Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Georgia Department of Banking and Securities."
