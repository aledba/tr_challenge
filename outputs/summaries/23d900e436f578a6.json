  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against a former San Diego County Sheriff's Department employee for making false and misleading statements in connection with an ongoing criminal investigation.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, Farhad Fredericks made a request to the California Department of Public Safety (CPSD) for access to records related to the conduct of law enforcement.  The complaint alleges that the CPSD requested access to the records in violation of Section 6254 of the Communications Act of 1940 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that Fredericks failed to provide sufficient information to justify the disclosure of the records.  As alleged in the complaint, Fredericks' request for the records was unreasonable because it required him to provide all of the requested information in a timely and reasonable manner.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the complaint charges Fredericks with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney for the District of San Diego today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Fredericks, charging him with violations of Section 5 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, and ordering him to pay $65 per hour for staff preparation and a $0.25 per page fee for each requested copy of the report. The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center, with the assistance of the San Diego Police Department's Office of Public Affairs. The litigation will be led by Michaelis, Montanari & Johnson, and supervised by Graham Loomis. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Attorney General's Office, and the California Secretary of State's Office."
