  "summary": "On August 16, 2018, the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (Commission) issued an order granting an intervenor status to Giant Food Stores, LLC (Giant) for an intermunicipal double transfer of Restaurant Liquor License No. R-13859 from B.J.'s Solid Gold, Inc., in Whitemarsh Township, Montgomery County, to its grocery store located next door to Giant. According to the Commission's order, Giant filed an application under the Liquor Code in February 2018 for a liquor license for a \"beer garden\" that will be located within 200 feet of the grocery store. The Commission alleges that Giant's application for the liquor license was denied because it did not meet the requirements for a protestant status. Giant's proposed beer garden will have seating for 30 patrons and offer prepared foods for takeout as well as for consumption on the premises. The Board's order granted Giant's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits Giant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The order also granted Giant the right to participate in a hearing examiner examination that will determine whether the Commission violated the anti-fraud provisions. The hearing examiner's order issued a recommendation that the Commission consider whether to grant the Commission a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) that prohibits the Commission from imposing any monetary penalty or imposing a civil penalty against Giant.  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Heap and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania."
