  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two defendants in a multi-pronged action brought by investors in a Broadway musical.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that Floyd Mutrux and/or Northern Lights, Inc. (collectively, the MDQ entities) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17705 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Gilbert Kelly and Northern Lights failed to file a financing statement with respect to certain portions of the funds that had not been assigned to Gilbert Kelly. The SEC alleges that, in addition to paying the attorney fees, Gilbert Kelly also failed to record certain of the interests assigned to him in the documents.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Gilbert Kelly, Cleopatra Records, Inc., Johnny B. Goode Limited Liability Company and MDQ Vegas LLC.  According to the complaint, in related litigation, both defendants had admitted to conduct amounting to breach of fiduciary duty and elder abuse, and both defendants consented to the entry of judgments ordering them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest of $11,550.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, and orders the defendants to pay civil penalties in the amount of $20,000 each. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Order No. 17705.03 (August 5, 2015).  The complaint charges Gilbert Kelly with violating Sections 10(e) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations.  On May 24, 2015, the trial court entered a judgment ordering Gilbert Kelly to pay $25,000 in attorney fees and costs, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and ordering him not to participate in the issuance of any securities laws.  Cleopra Records and Gilbert Kelly consented, in a parallel administrative proceeding, to a court order requiring them to comply with the SEC\u2019s order.  Gilbert Kelly agreed to pay the civil penalty and to pay an attorney fee of $50,000. The judgment is pending final approval by the court."
