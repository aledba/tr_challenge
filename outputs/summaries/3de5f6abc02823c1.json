  "summary": "On January 12, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment in favor of Baker Electric, Inc., a California-based energy company, against the company.  According to the court's order, filed on September 7, 2017, Baker, a former employee of Baker's, filed a complaint in federal district court in Sacramento, California, alleging that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  The court also found that Baker violated the preemption provision of the federal Arbitration Agreement, which requires states to arbitrate claims in arbitration.  In its judgment, the court held that a PAGA representative action cannot be compelled to arbitration without the state's consent.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Baker consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Baker also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On January 13, 2018 the court granted Baker's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to submit a response to the SEC's order.  As set forth in the order, Baker's response was untimely because it was inconsistent with the settled principles of the Federal Arbitration Act of 1940 and the obligations of the state to enforce the federal arbitration provisions of the law.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Birkenheier and supervised by Marc J. Ricchiute, with assistance from John R. Rymas of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit, and was supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
