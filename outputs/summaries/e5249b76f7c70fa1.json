  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Jersey today entered final judgments against two car dealerships for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court's order, which is subject to court approval, requires defendants to show cause why they are entitled to arbitration.  According to the order, the dealers' fraudulent practices and misrepresentations induced them to sign the transactional documents and that the agreements are invalid due to violations of statutory consumer fraud requirements.  In addition, the court found that the dealerships violated the arbitration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(d) of their contracts.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On November 5, 2016, plaintiff Janell Goffe of Cherry Hill, N.J. filed a civil injunctive action in federal district court against Mall Chevrolet, Inc. and Cherry Hill Mitsubishi, alleging that they violated the securities laws by failing to provide copies of the arbitration agreements they signed.  Goffe and Robinson agreed to settle the case by consenting to entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of these provisions, and ordering them to jointly and severally pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $500,000, respectively.  Additionally, Goffe agreed to be barred from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any automobile, and to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  She also agreed to a bar from appearing or practicing before a federal court as an attorney in a case involving an arbitration proceeding.  To settle the SEC's case, the parties agreed to pay $1.2 million in civil penalties and to the appointment of an independent arbitrator, who will determine the amount of the civil penalties owed to the parties.  Finally, the settlements are subject to the court's approval.  As set forth in the order above, the Court's order requires that defendants show cause and consent to the issuance of a judgment imposing permanent injunctions against future violations, and requires that the parties sign and maintain the books and records of the books, records, and records contained in the arbitration agreement.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 598 (2014).  The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the New Jersey Office of Financial Regulation."
