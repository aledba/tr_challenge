  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Indiana today announced criminal charges against a former middleman in an Arizona-to-Indiana drug trafficking scheme.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Geraldo Colon used his furniture store and a related business as a front to hide his more lucrative enterprise: buying large quantities of cocaine and heroin from Arizona and reselling the drugs to local dealers in Indiana.  According to the complaint, beginning in 2013, Colon purchased kilogram quantities of heroin from a Phoenix-based drug trafficker, who then sent couriers to deliver the shipments to Colon in Indianapolis.  Colon allegedly used the mall to receive the drugs and to disguise his drug trafficking activities.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, Colon was not a control person in the drug-trafficking scheme and, instead, commingled his drug proceeds with funds from the mall.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Central District of New York today entered a final judgment against Colon, ordering him to be sentenced to 30 years in prison.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Colon consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar.   The settlement is subject to court approval."
