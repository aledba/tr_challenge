  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with harassment in connection with a social media post she allegedly made on July 30, 2017.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Hines, New Jersey, alleges that defendant posted to her Facebook account, viewable only by her Facebook friends, that she intended to cause a risk of \"public inconvenience, annoyance and alarm\" to K.  According to the complaint, the defendant made the post through a series of text messages, including one in which she allegedly told K that she would cut her throat and \"watch out [K]!\"  The complaint further alleges that, although K was actually alarmed by the threat, she did not see the post.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The final judgments also order the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, as well as a civil penalty of $10,000, and a $25,000 officer and director bar.  On the same day, the court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a judgment of acquittal against them, and the defendants agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any public company. The court also ordered the defendant to pay a $75,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval. The SEC\u2019s continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Bivins and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the New York Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Jersey Office of Inspector General, the Connecticut Department of Banking and Securities, the Federal Office of Financial Regulation, the U.N. Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Internal Affairs Division."
