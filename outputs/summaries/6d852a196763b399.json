  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Library Tower, LLC and Lennar Chicago, Inc., a condominium association, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on June 13, 2017, the court denied the defendants' motion for leave to appeal, finding that the defendants failed to timely file an interlocutory appeal pursuant to Rule 307(a)(1) and that the court lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of their motion to compel arbitration.  The complaint further alleged that in 2015, the trial court issued an order denying Library Tower's motion for arbitration, which was deemed unreasonable because the defendants had agreed to participate in arbitration without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in 2016, a federal district court in Chicago issued a temporary restraining order preventing the defendants from proceeding with an arbitration proceeding until final judgment was entered.  On May 25, 2018, Salsitz entered a judgment ordering the defendants to comply with the court's order and consent to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and requires them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in the amount of $1.5 million.   The court also granted the defendants an expedited hearing to determine whether to proceed with an injunction against further violations of Rule 307, and granted them the right to respond to the court order by filing an alternative motion for a hearing.  As set forth in the Complaint, the Court found that defendants violated the federal law by failing to timely respond to a court order denying their motion for an injunction and ordering an immediate hearing on the matter.  It also found that, contrary to defendants' representations, the defendants did not file an emergency action and did not respond to any court order requiring them to respond within 30 days of the date the court issued the injunction.  Finally, it found that Defendants failed to adequately consider the facts of the case, including, among other things, whether the defendants were obligated to arbitrate the arbitration proceeding.  Without admitting to these facts, Defendants consented to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining them from violating the federal, state, and local securities laws, and ordering them to submit an application for a judgment imposing permanent injunctions against future violations.  Defendants also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, or sale of any securities in the United States, and to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. "
