  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a Florida man who was convicted of attempted second-degree murder for making a false and misleading statement to a hotel employee.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that the defendant, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, made an excited utterance to the hotel employee shortly after he and the employee entered the room for their sexual encounter. The complaint alleges that, shortly after entering the room, the defendant took out a knife and slashed the employee's throat. The SEC alleges that shortly after making the statement, he ran down the hallway, took an elevator to the lobby, and immediately approached the employee. The defendant allegedly told the employee that he had just shot his father with a shotgun, and that he wanted to show his father the shotgun before he shot himself.  According to the SEC, the complaint further alleges that soon after going into the hotel room, he changed his mind about the defendant's statement and tried to leave, but the defendant continued to stab the alleged victim in the torso and in the back of the head.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1 thereunder. The court also found that, in the alternative, that the defendants could not satisfy his burden of demonstrating that he was under any stress or excitement at the time he called 911 and gave his self-serving statement.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against one of the defendants for his role in the scheme of the scheme.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Florida Court of Appeals entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar. The judgment also orders the defendant to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  A hearing is scheduled for June 5, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 556-52 (Fla. 3d DCA 1990).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Miami Regional Office.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by"
