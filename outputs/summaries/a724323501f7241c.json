  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Anterius Beck, Jr., a former Chicago Police Department officer convicted of unlawful possession of a firearm by a street gang member and 10 counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon (AUUW), for which he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Beck was charged in August 2015 with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Beck agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of five years.  The judgment also prohibits Beck from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any firearm, other than for his own personal use.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Beck consented to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Beck.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Eric R. Werner."
