  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) against an Indian citizen who sought a work authorization for his U Visa application.  The court's order, which was entered on August 20, 2019, finds that the USCIS violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the agency has a duty to adjudicate whether an alien qualifies for work authorization.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, filed on July 31, 2015, Plaintiff alleges that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the Secretary of Homeland Security may grant work authorization to any alien who has a pending, bona fide application for a U Visa waiting list.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court has agreed to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins Defendants from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the Court granted a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violations of the federal laws and ordered them to comply with the court's orders.  On August 24, 2018, the Honorable Rebecca M. Welshhans entered a judgment against the Defendants, permanently enjoining her from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of her penalty. The court also ordered the defendants to provide a copy of the judgment to the U Visa committee, which will determine whether to place the nominee on the waiting list at a later date. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Wyshans. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Citizenship and Immigrant Services (CIS), the U.K. Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-CV-7092 (July 24, 2015).  The SEC encourages the public to check the background of anyone applying for a visa by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov website\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to quickly identify any red flags that could be red flags."
