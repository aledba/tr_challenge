  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of two felony counts of aggravated battery.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that on March 9, 2016, Officer Robert Luzadder conducted a search and seizure of a man and two women in the vicinity of 3100 South Lowe Avenue.  According to the complaint, the officer observed the man and the two women walking in the direction of the bus stop.  As alleged, the officers conducted a physical search of defendant's person and located a loaded five-shot revolver in his waistband. The complaint alleges that the officer followed the officer's instructions and conducted a protective pat-down of the defendant.  In its judgment, the court found that the officers violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that, in violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, the defendant was liable for a civil injunctive action, and the officer was entitled to a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see People v. Gherna, 2018 IL App (1st) 161009, (Dec. 8, 2016), and People vs. Kelly, 2017 Ill. App (2d) 16098, (1rd) 160611, (2nd) 1610, (4th) 16078, et al., (3rd) 2016, (8th) and (9th) (11th) of July, 2018, and (13th) July, 2017, (10th) in the United States Commodities Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\").  The court's order also requires the officer to provide a reasonable basis for reasonable suspicion of a person's intent to commit a felony, including the use or threat of physical force or violence against any individual.  On May 2, 2019, the Court issued a temporary restraining order against the defendant, ordering him to surrender his passport and to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The order also prohibits the officer from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security"
