  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against Eric William Wandemberg, who was convicted of two felony counts of strangulation, in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $14,500.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chesterfield County, Virginia, alleges that, on June 24, 2016, the court found that, in the course of a three-and-a-half-month trial, Wandembergg violated the anti-manipulation provisions of the federal securities laws. The court also found that he had violated Section 18.2-164(B)(2) and charged the victim with a felony for interfering with a 911 phone call. The complaint also alleges that WandemberG violated the antiterrorism provision of Section 10(b)(5) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Wandembergh.  On May 15, 2017, a federal district court in Alexandria, Virginia issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The order temporarily enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, and from participating in any future SEC proceedings.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of these provisions. The judgment also prohibits him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, from imposing any conduct-based injunctive relief, from associating with a law enforcement agency, from practicing or practicing, from entering a public building, from conducting a public offering of a business, from making any investment in a business venture, from purchasing or selling a security deposit, from engaging in any conduct that is not a criminal activity, from acting as an unregistered broker of a securities firm, from soliciting or offering a business investment in any securities offering, from issuing or selling any security deposit in the name of a company, or from conducting any sales of any securities in any public company. The final judgment also orders the defendant to pay $9,500 in restitution.  According to the SEC, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 2017).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Philadelphia Regional Office."
