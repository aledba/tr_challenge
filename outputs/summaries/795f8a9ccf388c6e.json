  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on September 5, 2018 entered a final judgment against the Florida Secretary of State for failing to enforce the federal Voting Rights Act.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, Florida, alleges that the Florida secretary of state violated the antifraud provisions of Section 4(e) of the federal voting rights act.  According to the complaint, the Secretary of state failed to provide timely and accurate information about how many Puerto Ricans are eligible to vote in Florida.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Florida Secretary Of State Mark Detzner failed to adequately record the number of Puerto Rican residents who lacked proficiency in the language of the state's official election laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the secretary of State consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins Florida from violating the federal securities laws and orders the imposition of a temporary restraining order.  Separately, the court issued an order temporarily freezing the assets of Florida's Department of State, which is subject to court approval.  On September 9, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Eastern District of New York entered a preliminary injunction against violations of Section 5(e).  The final judgment orders Florida to comply with the court's order, impose a $25,000 civil penalty, and pay disgorgement of $2,965, with prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,865, and a civil penalty of $10,000, with a $20,000 penalty in the event of a default judgment.   The court also ordered Florida to provide bilingual ballots and other assistance to Puerto Rican-American residents who are unable to read or understand any matter in the English language. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Scott Frost and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson in the Miami Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Frost and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Florida Department of Justice, and the Florida Office of Inspector General in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (Aug. 17, 2018)."
