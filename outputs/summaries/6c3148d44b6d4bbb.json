  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of attempting to persuade a 14-year-old high school student to produce child pornography.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, in 2013, Rande Isabella began chatting with S.F. through a mobile application called Minus. The complaint alleges that Mr. Isabella told her that he would like to meet her in person and suggested that she send him a picture of herself in her bra and underwear. According to the complaint, the complaint further alleges that he sent the picture of himself with a woman who was having a sexual experience with him.  He also allegedly asked her to send a video of herself masturbating, which he did not believe was true.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Isabella. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against the defendant, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 2422(b).  The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Deborah M. Welshhans of the U.N.
