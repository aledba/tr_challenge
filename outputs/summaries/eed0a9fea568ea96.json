  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against All Masonry & Landscape Supply, Inc., a San Diego-based construction company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Diego, all of the defendants agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  The SEC alleges that, in its judgment, the court found that all defendants were entitled to attorney fees when, in fact, they were not entitled to any fees at all.  In addition, it found that the defendants failed to incorporate the attorney fee provisions in the 2010 credit application into the original dealer agreement.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, the defendants also failed to include an attorney fee provision in the 2001 credit application.   The court also found that, contrary to the defendants' representations during litigation, Oldcastle did not qualify as a \"merchant\" under the federal securities laws, and that Oldcastle was liable for breach of contract, unfair business practices, unfair competition, and negligent hiring and supervision of Jeffrey Bal, a competitor's son.  Additionally, the judgment found that Allasonry was entitled to a civil penalty of $100,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a $50,000 civil penalty for a second defendant.  Without admitting, however, that the SEC found no basis for the defendants to recover attorney fees from Oldcastle, and instead ordered Oldcastle to pay $150,000 in civil penalties, which is equal to the amount of attorney fees that the parties will pay in the future.  On the same day, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Oldcastle and charged it with violations of Section 1642 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and with violating the broker-dealer registration provision of Section 15 of the Exchange Act and Rule 15a-1 thereunder, and charged Oldcastle with aiding and abetting Oldcastle's violations of Rule 15b2-1. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Wyshans. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
