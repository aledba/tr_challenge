  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a New York City landlord for defrauding a tenant out of $25,000 in attorney fees.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the landlord and tenant filed a claim splitting rule in the Central Square Village Court in October 2017.  The complaint alleges that, in a prior action by the landlord, he or she sought attorneys' fees for the purpose of recovering attorney fees incurred in prior action against a tenant.  As alleged in the complaint, however, this was a boilerplate, one-line request for attorney's fees in the tenant's Village Court answers, and thus could not be deemed a counterclaim under Real Property Law \u00a7\"234.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that the landlord was commencing new actions (or interposing new counterclaims) to secure additional relief that could have been obtained in the prior action, and that, as a result of this action, the tenant was barred from raising a new action.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and the landlord's motion to transfer, the defendants agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their respective profits.  Finally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.   The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General's Retail Strategy Task Force."
