  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against defendant David Thollander in contempt of court for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on May 21, 2018 and unsealed on May 24, 2018, the court issued an order imposing a $1,500 civil contempt penalty against the defendant.  The SEC alleges that, in the course of his conduct, the defendant repeatedly shouted, acted in a hostile manner, interjected with the court, and made numerous statements during the court proceedings.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced that it filed criminal contempt charges against Tholland.  As alleged in the complaint, Thollanders failed to receive a copy of the court's order or to file a brief in this matter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the judge granted the court a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also granted the defendant the right to reapply as a defendant in a civil contempt proceeding on a later date.  On June 5, 2019, the Honorable Kathleen M. Welshhans appointed a receiver to oversee the receivership of the receiver. The receiver will determine the amount of restitution to be paid to the receiver in the event of a court order.  A hearing on June 26, 2019 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern. The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov website to quickly and easily identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint alleges that:    (1) the defendant failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his or her claims; (2) he failed to comply with court orders; (3) to provide timely and an opportunity to be heard; (4) to respond to a subpoena; (5) to a hearing; (6) to make a statement in allocution before being sanctioned; and (7) to show cause and effect.  (8) The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Illinois Department of Justice in its investigation of these matters."
