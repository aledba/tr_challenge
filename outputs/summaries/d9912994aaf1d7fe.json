  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Karen McDonell, a Maryland resident who was terminated from participating in the Housing Choice Voucher Program.  The court found that, as a matter of law, the HCHA violated the due process provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore on June 8, 2011, McDonelly was enrolled in the program and was required to make monthly payments of $42.22. The complaint alleges that, in November 2015, the agency terminated her from the program because she was not entitled to a contested case hearing.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it had obtained a court order to suspend the program.  McDonelli has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court granted the court's motion for a temporary restraining order, a temporary asset freeze, and a conduct-based injunction. The court's order, which was entered on June 9, 2016, requires the court to determine whether to impose a permanent injunction, impose a hearing suspension, or otherwise impose an order requiring a hearing in which the court will consider the merits of the case. The SEC's order also requires that the court consider whether to suspend or revoke the right to reapply for a court-ordered hearing. The Court's order requires the hearing suspension to be conducted in a timely manner and the appointment of a hearing officer.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 543 (March 29, 2016).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development, and the Maryland Office of Inspections and Examinations, which administers the federal housing assistance programs, including the Department of Health and Human Services, which provides assistance to low-income communities."
