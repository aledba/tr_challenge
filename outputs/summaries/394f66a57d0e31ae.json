  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia today entered a final judgment against Mechel Bluestone, Inc., a coal mining company, against the company's request to add cervical intervertebral disc syndrome to its compensation claim.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on July 24, 2013, Carl E. Nuckolls injured his back in a rock fall that occurred at Princeton Community Hospital. The complaint alleges that he sought treatment for pain in his lower back and neck and was diagnosed with a back sprain.  The complaint further alleges that on the date of the injury, a rock fell on him and injured his cervical spine and lower back.  As alleged in the complaint, the rock hit him between the shoulders and the back of the head and caused him to lose his right hand and numb his left hand.  In a letter to the claims administrator, Dr. Sexton, M.D., stated that the cervical spine should not be included as compensable under this claim because it was caused by a compensable injury.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC complaint, Nuckoll consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Timothy E. Huffman, Reginald D. Henry, and Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit. The litigation will be led by Timothy P. Huffmann and supervised by Amy C. Barry."
