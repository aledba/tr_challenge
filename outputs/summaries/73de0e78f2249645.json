  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against defendant Timothy Dewayne Foreman, Jr., who was convicted of two drug-related charges.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against him, freezing his assets, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of 91/212 years.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Peoria, Illinois, Foreman was arrested on September 23, 2000, while driving while license suspended and was found to have 5 bags of suspected cocaine inside a Chevrolet Tahoe. The complaint alleges that the officers executed the search warrant on the Tahoe and found a large amount of cocaine in the car. The SEC alleges that defendant was not present at the time of the search when the officers conducted the search, and that he had not been convicted of any of the other-crimes charges. In addition, the court found that defendant had a prior felony conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, a Class 1 felony, and a Class 4 felony. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder. The court granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations and ordered a hearing on the matter.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Foreman. Among other things, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendant, charging him with violating Section 5 of the Uniform Code of Laws, and with violating Sections 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d). The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael H. Graham and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Graham, Ms. Barry, and Mr. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
