  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Indiana today announced criminal charges against Ronnie Ricketts, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to seventeen and one-half years in prison for a felony burglary.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Indianapolis on March 2, 2017, Ricketts entered the dining hall of the Evansville Rescue Mission with the intent to kill two men. As alleged in the complaint, the two men had been together for four years and Ricketts told them that if they did not leave her alone, they would be dead. The complaint alleges that Ricketts then shot through a window and shot through the window of the mission, causing the men to scramble for their lives.  The complaint further alleges that, despite having been diagnosed with several mental illnesses, he had no idea how he would be able to represent himself in a criminal trial.  Ricketts also allegedly told one of the men that he would \"undone\" under the pressure of the trial, and that he had \"no idea\" how to \"deal with\" the situation.  In addition, the complaint alleges, as a result of his actions, he has been sentenced to a total of seventeen years, seventeen months of incarceration, and a five-year officer-and-director bar.  On March 9, 2018, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction against Ricketts from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Ricketts to pay a civil penalty of 17 years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC complaint, however, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay civil penalties of five years, and imposes a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from associating with anyone other than himself. The court also granted a request for a temporary restraining order, which was granted by the court on March 8, 2018.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Indiana State Attorney General's Office, and the Indiana Department of Criminal Justice."
