  "summary": "On March 8, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Wisconsin Central, Ltd., a freight train company, and its former engineer, Darrin Riley, in a civil injunctive action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Wisconsin Central and Riley violated the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that Wisconsin Central was negligent in failing to adequately protect its injured railroad workers from property damage caused by a train accident.  As alleged in the complaint, the company's failure to follow required speed limits or apply the emergency brakes before the collision caused significant damage to its property.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company.  On March 9, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action in which it obtained a temporary restraining order and obtained an emergency court order to halt the alleged violations of Section 55 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Exchange Act, and order them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Pollock and supervised by Scott A. Kasper of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Illinois Attorney General's Office in this matter."
