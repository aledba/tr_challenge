  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against a Virginia man who was convicted of distribution of cocaine, third or subsequent offense.  The court found that the Commonwealth of Virginia violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to show probable cause to obtain the CSLI without a warrant.  According to the court's order, Reed was arrested on July 18, 2012, and was subsequently sentenced to twenty-four months of incarceration for violating the federal securities laws. The court also found that Reed had a reasonable, good faith belief that his actions were reasonable and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Reed. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Alexandria, Virginia, charges Reed with violating Section 19.2-70.3(B). The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The Court also issued an order suspending Reed from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Reed consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and a $10,000 officer-and-director bar.  On June 22, 2018, the court granted Reed\u2019s motion for a writ of certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to the Virginia Supreme Court for further consideration in the matter of Carpenter v. United States, No. 565-15-4, 201 L.Ed.2d 507 (2018).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Virginia Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Virginia Department of Justice in this matter."
