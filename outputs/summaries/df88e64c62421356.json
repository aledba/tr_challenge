  "summary": "On August 9, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against the defendants in a parallel criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, alleges that the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to show sufficient evidence to support their claims that their children were at substantial risk of serious physical harm because of the lack of adequate parental supervision or protection due to father\u2019s untreated anger management problem.  In addition, the complaint alleges that father failed to adequately assess the issues related to placement of the child with a relative, despite repeated requests from the social worker to do so.  As alleged in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, however, father had a history of domestic violence, including convictions for felony domestic violence in 2011 and 2012, and was awaiting trial on charges that he molested his daughter.  Without admitting or denying the defendants\u2019 allegations, the Defendants have consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b)(5) and 13(a)(2) and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  They have also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in reunification services, including services for services for domestic violence and anger management, and to participate in general counseling and substance abuse services.   The defendants also have agreed to pay civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 and $20,000, respectively, for each of their violations of Section 12(e) and (f) of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 12b2-1 thereunder, for a total of $25,000. \u00c2\u00a0The defendants also agreed that the court should have held a hearing under section 361.3 to evaluate the relative for placement, even when the relative was unable or unwilling to adopt the child.  Specifically, the court could have ordered placement with the relative at the time of the section 366.26 hearing.  On May 22, 2014, the juvenile court sustained the allegations in the Department's amended section 300 petition and ordered the defendants to comply with the court order. The defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to permanent injunctions against further violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 15a-1, Section 15b-2, and Section 15e-3, and, thereafter, to the issuance of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating Section"
