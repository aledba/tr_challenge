  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained a temporary restraining order against a D.C. court-appointed receiver.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, DC, John Croley established that an RNC-employed security guard physically assaulted him while photographing an overflowing dumpster on the street where he lived, planning to present the photos at an upcoming zoning meeting as evidence of a public sanitation problem. The complaint alleges that, as alleged, the security guard did not respond to Croley\u2019s requests for a physical examination or to his requests for an extension of time to respond to a court order granting his request for disbursement.

Croley agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently restrains his assets and prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any property in violation of the federal or state laws, including the right to reapply as a judge based on the merits of the case. The court also agreed to send Croley a copy of the judgment to the registry for review and to consider whether to issue an order appointing a receiver to collect the funds.
