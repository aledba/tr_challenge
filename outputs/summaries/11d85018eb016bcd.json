  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a Baton Rouge, Louisiana woman who suffered serious injuries in a slip-and-fall accident.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that on June 19, 2014, Torsor Toussaint accompanied her mother to Baton Rouge General Medical Center (BRGMC) for medical services. According to the complaint, the day of the slip and fall, the woman fell in what she described as a \"wet floor\" and was injured in the process of mopping up a spill in the admissions area. The complaint further alleges that the woman did not see water on the floor before she fell, and instead used a damp string mop and a mop bucket to clean up the mess. The SEC alleges that after the fall, Mrs. Toussiaint stood up and began walking back down the hall towards the admissions desk, where she was confronted by a housekeeping employee who questioned her about the condition of the floor. The trial court ultimately found that she did not carry her burden of proving that she slipped and fell in a wet floor, and that she should have had someone stand near the spot where she fell.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against the woman.  On August 8, 2017, the SEC filed an emergency action against BRGMC, alleging that it was negligent, in not allocating any comparative fault to her or HHS, and in failing to allocate any reasonable compensation to her for her injuries.   The complaint also alleges that in a separate administrative proceeding, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the company from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the company to pay disgorgement of $6,900.40, general damages of $15,000.00, and deposition costs of $1,500.00.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the company consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $2,500,000, and imposing a $10,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the New Orleans Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Brunson."
