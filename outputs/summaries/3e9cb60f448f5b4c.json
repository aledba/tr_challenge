  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action against a Colorado grandmother for failing to timely file a petition for the adoption of a child with the agency.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, alleges that the grandmother filed a motion to intervene in a dependency and neglect case in February 2017. The complaint alleges that, as a result of the termination of her parental rights, the child was removed from her mother's care shortly after she was born and mother's parental rights were terminated a year later. According to the complaint, the grandmother was not informed of the terminated parental rights until February 2018, when she filed a petition to intervene and the court refused to accept her filing of a petition in the child's favor. The court's order, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins the grandmother from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a related administrative proceeding, the court granted the grandmother's request for a temporary restraining order against future violations of the federal securities laws and ordered her to file a complaint with the court. The case was investigated by the SEC's Office of Inspector General, which issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the Denver Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Denver Office of Child Advocacy, and the Colorado Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
