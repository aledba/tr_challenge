  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against defendant Byron E. Scherf in a parallel criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, alleges that Scherf violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17(b)(2) thereunder.
