  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was sentenced to seventy years in prison for his role in a 2006 drive-by shooting that left an innocent sixteen year old dead and two other innocent bystanders seriously injured.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that, in November 2006, when the defendant was seventeen years old, he participated in a drive by shooting into a crowd in Connecticut. The complaint alleges that the defendant and his accomplice thought that someone responsible for a gang related shooting the previous week was at the scene of the crime.

The order also prohibits the defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any firearm, other than for the purpose of obtaining a copy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Quantitative Surveillance System (QS) that includes video surveillance. The SEC also issued an order requiring the court to consider the mitigating factors of a defendant before imposing a sentence, including his age, his family and home environment, the hallmark features of adolescence, and his inability to extricate himself from that environment.
