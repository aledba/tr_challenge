  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia on October 28, 2016, entered a final judgment against the Attorney General for unsealing an index of documents related to the proposed merger of two hospitals.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kanawha County, W.Va., alleges that, in October 2016, the attorney general received a copy of the index from the Federal Trade Commission, which requested it be unsealed as part of an investigation into the merger of St. Mary\u2019s Medical Center, Inc. and Cabell Huntington Hospital, Inc., a Huntington, West Virginia acute care hospital.  According to the complaint, the SEC requested the index and related documents from the attorney General.  In response, the court issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the documents and ordering the unsealing of the entire index.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the AG consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to produce and submit to the SEC the index of the 349 documents and the related documents. The court also issued an order freezing the assets of the two hospitals and ordering them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,038,767, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On November 5, 2017, the Honorable Judge Robert C. McCole granted the SEC and its investigation of the merger with the assistance of the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, including the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, which is conducting an examination of the mergers.  McCole also granted the court's order to freeze the assets and pay interest in a civil action brought by the SEC against the other hospitals and related entities.
