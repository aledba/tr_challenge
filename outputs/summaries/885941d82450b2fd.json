  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in a civil injunctive action brought by Am. Bioscience, Inc., a home health services provider based in Alexandria, Virginia.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on March 11, 2010, AdvanceMed, a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services contractor, conducted an investigation based on a complaint that plaintiff had been overpaid approximately $1 million for services that the agency determined were not covered by Medicare. The complaint alleges that, based on this finding, plaintiff was not entitled to a waiver of liability for the overpayments because the plan of care provided to plaintiff did not meet the criteria for Medicare coverage.  The complaint further alleges that the complaint was not supported by substantial evidence in the record, and the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General (OIG) today announced that it has issued an order suspending or ordering the suspension of certain of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the issuance of an order permanently enjoining Defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of these provisions, and orders them to pay a civil monetary penalty equal to the amount of their profits. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Ms. Bowers and Ms. Gaunt. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Homeland Security, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OFCA)."
