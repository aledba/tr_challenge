  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the defendants in an eminent domain case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles on April 19, 1982, the defendants agreed to settle the case by agreeing to a bifurcated trial.  The SEC alleges that the defendants made a series of offers and demands, including one for $450,000, which was substantially higher than the original offer and demand.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in the course of the litigation, defendants made multiple offers to acquire the property, including $570,000 for the land and improvements, $200,000 of loss of goodwill and $1.88 million for a vegetation easement.  As alleged in the complaint, these offers were not reasonable because the property owner was not entitled to compensation at the time of the actual trial, and the defendants' offer was unreasonable.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendants consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and order the defendants to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of their civil penalties, which will be determined by the court at a later date.  Additionally, the court granted the property owners' request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendants from making any offer or demand before the date of the trial, to the appointment of an independent appraiser, and to the payment of civil penalties in the event of a default judgment.  Finally, the Court of Appeals issued an order suspending the defendants and ordering them to comply with the court's order.  On May 24, 2013, the Honorable Judge Robert J. Burt of the United States District Court in the Southern District of New York granted the parties' motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the defendants return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest.  Burt has agreed to a permanent injunction and to pay a civil penalty of $2.5 million, which is equal to the amount that he has already agreed to pay in civil penalties of $250,000 and $7,500, respectively.  Judge Burt also agreed to the imposition of a $50,000 civil penalty and to a $20,000 bar.  A hearing on May 24 will be held on May 25, 2013 to determine whether to proceed with the settlement of the claims.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17."
