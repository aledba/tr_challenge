  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of California today announced that it has obtained a court order halting the partial government shutdown of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Jose, California, alleges that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) terminated the DACA program on September 5, 2018, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The complaint alleges that DHS violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the agency violated Section 13(a)(1)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) thereunder. DHS has agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $20,000. The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an injunction against future violations of Section 1252(g) and Rule 13b2-1. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The case is being handled by Kelly's Office of Inspector General and the Office of the United States Attorney for the Central District of New York. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.N. Secret Service, and the Mexican Secret Service."
