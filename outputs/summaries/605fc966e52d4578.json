  "summary": "On November 4, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania-based company and its owner in an asset purchase agreement.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Berks County, Pennsylvania, alleges that, in November 2016, The Rose Corporation, f/k/a The Rose Corp., purchased for $1.250 million, a business that provided contract manufacturing, industrial fabrication and related installation services, for $519,394.00.  According to the complaint, the Rose Corp. agreed to the purchase price adjustment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In addition, the complaint alleged that, on August 23, 2017, the trial court issued an order requiring the parties to submit their dispute before an independent accountant to determine whether the parties were entitled to arbitration under Section 2.2.3 of the Agreement, and that the parties had agreed to arbitration based on the amount of the proposed PPA.   The complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to comply with the court's order by failing to agree in good faith to the selection of an independent and impartial accountant.  Finally, the court found that, contrary to the defendants' claims, the parties' dispute was not within the scope of their agreement for alternative dispute resolution.  As a result, the defendants were unable to resolve the issue of whether they had satisfied a condition precedent to arbitration, i.e., submission of a PPA to an accountant, without violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Additionally, the SEC's investigation was conducted by David Rymas and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office, and the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office in this matter."
