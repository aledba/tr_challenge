  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona today entered a final judgment against Brenda D. of Arizona, finding that she violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Phoenix, alleges that, in violation of Section 8 of the Exchange Act, Brenda failed to timely appear for a termination adjudication hearing.  According to the complaint, Brenda also failed to show up for the termination hearing, despite repeated requests to do so.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court did not err in finding that a parent had waived his or her legal rights by failing to appear at the termination proceeding.  As alleged, the court found that the parent had \"failed to show sufficient cause\" for her failure to appear, and therefore terminated her parental rights.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Brenda consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders her to disgorge her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and requires her to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The final judgment also prohibits Brenda from participating in termination proceedings, including as a mother or a father, and orders her not to participate in the termination proceedings.  For further information, see Arizona Department of Children and Family Services (DCCFS) v. Kelly, 206 Ariz. 547, 549, 872 P.3d 684, 677 (2009).

A hearing for Brenda was scheduled for 2:14 p.m. on June 15, but Brenda did not show up.  On June 16, the hearing was adjourned until after the court had concluded its finding that Brenda had waived her rights and that she had admitted the allegations in the complaint to the juvenile court.  After the hearing concluded, Brenda was not permitted to return to the witness box.
