The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, from 2006 through 2011, L-3 Communications, LLC (L-3), through its former general counsel, Charles A. Edwards, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Edwards aided and abetted PaineSnider\u2019s violations of Section 15(a) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, and that he assisted and assisted with her violations of Rule 15a-1.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Edwards.  According to the SEC, Edwards agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his profits.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Edwards consented to a judgment ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay a civil monetary penalty, and appoint a receiver to represent him in the litigation.  On May 9, 2007, the SEC filed an emergency action against Edwards and Womble, LLC, alleging that Edwards violated its fiduciary duties by failing to disclose material facts about the litigation that he and his firm had engaged in, including that he had provided legal advice to Painesnider in drafting her complaint.  As alleged in the complaint, Edwards also violated the anti-fraud provision of the Exchange Act and Rules 15b-20, 13a-21, and 16a-24.
