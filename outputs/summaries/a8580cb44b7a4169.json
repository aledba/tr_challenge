  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Michael P. Hidalgo, who was convicted of domestic abuse battery in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, on May 22, 2017, at 8:36 p.m., a Marrero, Louisiana man was arrested by his wife and son at a local bar. The complaint alleges that defendant was drinking excessively, staying out until late hours of the night, and being very aggressive. According to the complaint, defendant then allegedly kicked his wife in the face, causing her to fall, hit her head, and have other injuries. The court also denied the motion for a new trial, which was denied on motion by the trial judge.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against defendant. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against defendant, charging him with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and Section 13(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $500,000 officer-and-director bar. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a five-year civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 24, 2017 at approximately 5:36, the court granted a temporary restraining order against defendant and ordered him to return to his home. The judge granted the request for a hearing on June 10, 2019, and ordered that the hearing be conducted in the appropriate setting. The hearing was conducted by Assistant Chief of the New Orleans Division of Criminal Investigations. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Division, and the Louisiana State Corporation Commission in this matter."
