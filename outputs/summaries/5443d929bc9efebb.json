  "summary": "On March 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against Mother and father-in-law who are charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that, in April 2016, Mother filed an emergency motion to suspend her parenting time with the children because of her active alcoholism. The court found that, contrary to Mother's assertions, Mother had repeatedly tested positive for alcohol consumption, had been removed from her parents' home by the police while the children were there, and had a history of drug-related problems. According to the complaint, the trial court's order temporarily suspended Mother's parenting time on Wednesday overnights and ordered her to submit to an EtG Hair Alcohol Test within ten days. The complaint further alleges that the court improperly restrained Mother from participating in an intensive outpatient program and continuing her sobriety as reflected in the court order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Mother. The SEC also announced an emergency court order halting Mother's access to the internet for a second time, ordering her to surrender her passport, and requiring her to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Mother consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws. The final judgment orders Mother to comply with the court's orders and imposes a $500,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On February 6, 2017, the court issued an order requiring Mother to submit a written consent to a hearing on her behalf. The order also requires her to provide a record demonstrating that she made this request in the case of her arrest for DWI in Candia on June 20 and in Bedford on June 23. The judge granted the motion and, in December, issued an ex parte order granting Mother the right to return to her parents after a five-year court-ordered absence. The Court also granted the request for an emergency order suspending Mother's parental rights and responsibilities. The case was supervised by Christine Summers, who is a registered representative of the United Kingdom. The litigation will be led by Ms. Summers and Ms. Sansone. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the British Columbia Securities Commission in this matter."
