  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Data Foundry, Inc., a Texas-based energy company, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Austin, Texas, alleges that the City of Austin unlawfully charged retail electricity rates that are unreasonable and confiscatory, and that the rates constituted an illegal tax.  According to the complaint, the complaint alleges that, contrary to the City\u2019s stated policy, the rates are excessive in that the city is required to recover wholesale power generation costs and a return on power generation assets when, in fact, the city does not.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, this is not an unreasonable rate of return, and the city has no right to impose such a rate on its retail customers.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the city, and ordering the city to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the Texas Attorney General's Office has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint to the SEC\u00c2\u00a0Commission on\u00c2\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission\u00c2\u00a0On\u00c2\u00a0January\u00c2\u00a017, 2018,\u00c2\u00a01\u00c2\u00a02018\u00c2\u00a0in the Market Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Department of Insurance in this matter."
