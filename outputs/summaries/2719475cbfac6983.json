  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against the Stamford Police Association against a former officer who sought a disability pension.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Stamford, Connecticut, alleges that Paul Fagan, a former Stamford Police Officer, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") as well as Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that the Stamford Board of Directors improperly denied Fagan's request for an enhanced disability pension based on his October 25, 2012 medical report that he submitted to the board. According to the complaint, after being notified of the board's January 8, 2013 decision on his disability pension application, Fagan immediately contacted Carolan and apprised her that a disability rating of \"30 percent or more\" was required to qualify for the pension. Carolan replied, \"I have been requested by [the plaintiff] to use the fifth edition of the [guide] for my permanent/partial disability pension.\" The board ultimately decided not to grant Fagan the pension, despite repeated requests from the plaintiff. The SEC alleges that Carolan, Solomon, and Plancher violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(b)(2) of The Securities Act, and Sections 9(a)(1) and (3) of\u00c2\u00a0The Exchange Act. The court also found that Fagan violated Section 15(e) of Exchange Act Rule 15e-3 thereunder, and that the Board violated Rule 16a-1 thereunder of the Exchange Act and Rule 16b2-3. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Connecticut today announced criminal charges against Fagan. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Department of Health and Human Services, the Connecticut State Auditor's Office, and the Connecticut Attorney General's Office."
