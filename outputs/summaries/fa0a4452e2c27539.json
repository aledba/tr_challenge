  "summary": "On September 22, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Massachusetts entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found to be sexually dangerous and committed to the treatment center for an indeterminate period of from one day to life. The court found that the defendant was not a sexually dangerous person and that he or she was entitled to a civil commitment that would permit him or her to remain in the institution for an indefinite period of time.  According to the court's order, however, the defendant had a history of sexual violence and had been previously convicted of two prior sexual violence-related charges.  The court also found that, where one of the qualified examiners concluded that the individual was not sexually dangerous, the individual could be released from the institution and sent back to prison to serve the remainder of his or her sentence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant.  As alleged in the complaint, Johnstone was incorrectly decided because neither qualified examiner had offered the opinion that he was no longer sexually dangerous.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the court held that Johnstone violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) thereunder of the federal securities laws, and that, in the alternative, the judge may order Johnstone to be released before the date of his/her sentencing.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 551, 903 N.E.2d 1074 (2007).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Boston, charges Johnstone with violating the anti-fraud provisions and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The complaint also seeks an officer-and-director bar against Johnstone and a bar prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply for a hearing at any time after a judge or jury finds reasonable cause to believe that the person is not a \"sex dangerous person.\"  The complaint seeks a temporary restraining order, a conduct-based injunction, and an order requiring the defendant to comply with the requirements of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.   The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Department of Health and Human Services and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office."
