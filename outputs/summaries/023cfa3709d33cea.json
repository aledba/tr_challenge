  "summary": "On September 5, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against BMO Harris Bank, Inc., a Chicago-based bank, for failing to pay a $650,000 deficiency in a mortgage. The court granted the bank\u2019s request for an automatic stay of the default judgment, which means that it can proceed with the foreclosure proceedings after the bankruptcy is concluded. The Court also granted the Bank\u2019S request for a partial and complete relief from the automatic stay, which is required by the federal bankruptcy laws.  The court also entered an order granting the Bank a partial judgment against Anderson for the same amount of shortfall that the bankruptcy court had awarded to the bank.  In a parallel action, the Court issued an order requiring the Bank to present in a single proceeding all of its theories arising from one transaction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, the Bank has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering it to file a related action in federal court against Anderson.  According to the court order, Anderson and his wife, Frankona Reinsurance Co. v. Legion Indemnity Co., were jointly and severally liable on the loan and the Bank was entitled to a deficiency judgment in a separate proceeding.  As a result of the Court order, the bank has not been able to collect any additional funds from the bank, and the court has not issued an emergency order to halt the foreclosure action.  On September 6, 2018, the court issued its final judgment in favor of the Bank, ordering Anderson to comply with the court's order, ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and appointing a receiver to oversee the foreclosure proceeding. The judgment also requires the bank to show cause and effect in a parallel proceeding, and requires the receiver to provide a copy of the judgment to the receiver.
