  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Keith Allen Salter, finding him in contempt of court for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, between August 2017 and August 2017, Salter engaged in a pattern of misconduct that included repeatedly stating that he could not testify to matters outside of the record, despite the trial court's repeated instructions and admonishments over a two day period. The complaint further alleges that Salter repeatedly attempted to convince the jury that he was not in direct criminal contempt because he had a prior conviction of \"No Operator's License\" and that this conviction was a Class 2 Misdemeanor. In addition, the complaint alleges that he failed to adequately disclose to the jury his prior criminal convictions, including a second-degree murder conviction designated as a B1 offense, and failed to disclose his prior felony convictions to the court. The SEC also alleges that defendant repeatedly failed to comply with the closing argument instructions and warned him not to testify during his closing argument if he did so again. Finally, the court admonished defendant repeatedly for making the same statements during closing arguments, which he did not do.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Salter.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the SEC has filed a civil injunctive action, obtained a temporary restraining order, and obtained an order suspending Salter from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On August 9, 2017, the Atlanta District Court entered Judgment against Defendant on the felony Stalking and Criminal Contempt Order against Defendant for the same conduct. The court also issued an Order suspending Defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of the Judgment, and ordering him to pay a $300,000 civil penalty. The Court's order against Defendant is subject to court approval.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 5A-11(a)(1) and (3) of the Commission on Securities and Exchange Act Section 5(a) and Rules 5a-13(a), (c) and 5(c) thereunder, and the Commission's Complaint Bulletin No. 15A-1451(a).  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Christopher R. McCole and supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Salter and supervised"
