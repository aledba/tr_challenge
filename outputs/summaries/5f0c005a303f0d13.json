  "summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced charges against PlayNation Play Systems, Inc., a company that makes and sells children\u2019s playground equipment, for failing to timely respond to a court order that held it in contempt.  The SEC alleges that PlayNation violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC, PlayNation and its two officers and shareholders, Peter Velikin and Kiril Alexandrov, were not required to respond to the court order by filing a civil contempt action against Velex. Instead, the court found that Velex violated its duty to comply with the injunction and ordered Velex to pay $46,465.25 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against both Velex and Alexandrov.  On June 5, 2018, the federal district court in New York entered a final judgment finding that the defendants violated the Exchange Act and ordered them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1,500 each.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaint, Velex consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins it from violating Exchange Act Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and orders it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount that it has already paid to the parties in contempt of Exchange Act Section 5(b).  The settlement is subject to court approval.  For additional information, see Litigation Release Release No. 598.25 (Jan. 24, 2019).   \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action on June 13, 2018 against Vele, alleging that it violated Exchange Act Rules 5a-5, 5c-8, and 5d-11 thereunder, and that Vele violated Exchange Order Rule 5b2-1. The SEC also charged Velex with violating Exchange Order Rules 5b-8 and 5c2-3.   The complaint also alleges that, contrary to the Exchange Order, Vele failed to respond quickly to Exchange Act Rule 5c4-1, and failed to timely comply with Exchange Order Order 5d2-2, 5d4-"
