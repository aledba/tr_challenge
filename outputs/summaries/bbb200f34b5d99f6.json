  "summary": "On March 13, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against PAJ Ventures, L.P., a Pennsylvania-based company that claims to own and operate a picnic grove on Liberty Street, Bath, Pennsylvania.  The court found that the company violated the antifraud provisions of Section 200-33F of the Pennsylvania Zoning Ordinance and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, PAJ failed to meet its burden in finding that the property was abandoned because Joe Timmer suffered from dementia, was declared incapacitated in 2014, and passed away in 2015.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office today announced criminal charges against the company for its role in the alleged abandonment of the property.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, charges PAJ with violating the anti-dementia provisions of Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8 thereunder, and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the company consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating these provisions, and orders it to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000.  It also agreed to pay an $80,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. \u00c2\u00a0The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-5221 (March 13, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and Ms. Gibson is supervising the matter."
