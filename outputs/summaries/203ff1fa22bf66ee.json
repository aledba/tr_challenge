  "summary": "On May 8, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia entered a final judgment against Michael Dixon, a former resident of Atlanta, Georgia, for defrauding his grandmother by falsely claiming that BB&T had no legal right to foreclose on the property formerly owned by his grandmother.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Dixon was injured by a foreclosure attempt on a 1.15-acre tract of real estate, which was never subject to the property's foreclosure.  The complaint alleges that the foreclosure attempt was a fraudulent one, and that Dixon did not need to prove facts in support of his claim.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Dixon failed to adequately allege that his grandmother owned the property, which he claimed was worth millions of dollars.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, Dixon consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.  Dixon also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On May 9, 2019, the court orally granted Dixon's motion for summary judgment against him, ordering him to comply with the court's order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Scott Frost and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Frost and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Atlanta Office of Financial Regulation, and the Georgia Office of the Attorney General's Office in this matter."
