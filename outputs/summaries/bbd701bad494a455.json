  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the National Park Service for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 1968, the Park Service re-opened Ford's Theatre to the public after attempting to restore it to the state in which it operated on the night President Lincoln was assassinated.  According to the complaint, the park service's decisions concerning the safety features at Ford's were not discretionary. Rather, the complaint alleges that handrails were installed alongside the stairs at the time of Ms. Wesberry's fall.  In a parallel action, on May 7, 2015, the Honorable Paul J. Burt of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the federal government, and imposing a civil injunctive action against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $10,000.   The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Kerstetter and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U.N. Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Office of the Chief of the Philadelphia Regional Office in this matter."
