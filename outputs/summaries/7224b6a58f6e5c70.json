  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the San Francisco-based sand mining company, Hanson Marine Operations, Inc. (HMS).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Francisco, California, alleges that the California Secretary of State's Office (SLC) improperly approved a sand mining project in 2016 without considering whether the leases constituted a public trust use.  According to the complaint, the SLC's decision to approve the project violated the common law public trust doctrine.  The complaint alleges that, as part of its public trust analysis, Hanson failed to consider whether the sand mining leases were a legitimate use of public trust lands.  In addition, the complaint alleged that Hanson violated the federal trust doctrine by approving the leases without considering the merits of the claims in the public trust report.  As a result of the SEC's findings, Hanson's project was not eligible for re-certification under the common trust doctrine, and the court granted the court's order to proceed with the reapproval of the project.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Hanson has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and from participating in the issuance of any penny stock in any public company offering or offering of any security deposit.  Baykeeper has also agreed to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal and state securities laws.  On June 21, 2017, the court issued a temporary restraining order against Hanson, ordering him to comply with the court order, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against him.  A hearing on June 24, 2017 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  To learn more about public trust issues, see Public Trust Advocacy Center v.
