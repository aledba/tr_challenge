  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was sentenced to 49 years-to-life in adult criminal court for his role in a January 5, 2009 shooting that left one teenager critically injured.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered him to return to his room.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, Christopher Canon, a 16-year-old who was convicted of first-degree murder with a personal firearm-discharge enhancement, told the court that he would use a gun to kill another teenager. The complaint alleges that the court found defendant guilty of the five statutory violations of the federal securities laws. The court further ruled that defendant was entitled to a limited remand to determine whether he was fit to serve as an adult and whether he had sufficient opportunity to make a record of his actions at a subsequent sentencing hearing.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Canon. The SEC also announced that it would conduct a hearing on whether to issue an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.  On January 6, 2019, the court issued an order requiring the trial court to consider whether to impose a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years to life on a juvenile offender who had committed a serious felony. The order also requires the court to conduct a \"youth offender parole hearing\" during the course of a sentencing proceeding.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The judgment also prohibits the defendant from associating with any person who has been convicted of a serious criminal offense with a prior felony conviction. In addition, the order requires the defendant to show cause and effect of his or her prior criminal conviction, including that he has a history of mental illness and that he had suffered childhood trauma. The judge granted the motion for a hearing and ordered the receiver to conduct an independent review of the defendant's criminal history. The receiver will determine whether to send a message to the receiver that he is fit and proper to serve a sentence in adult court.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the case was supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa, Chief of the San Francisco Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory and Ms. Gregory."
