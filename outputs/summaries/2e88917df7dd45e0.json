  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Oregon today announced criminal charges against a Dayton, Ohio woman accused of acting as an unregistered agent in a drug investigation.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dayton, alleges that, on an April evening, Deputy Samerdyke, while on patrol, observed a car pull out of a parking lot behind a commercial nursery. The complaint alleges that the officer followed defendant's car, which was parked behind the nursery building, and asked her if she had been smoking marijuana. The officer allegedly replied that she had not, and did not want to \"hide\" from him. The SEC further alleges that Samsdyke followed the car for approximately 20 minutes until he and a second officer entered the car and questioned the car. As alleged in the complaint, the officer asked her whether there was anything illegal in the car, and she replied that there was no drug in it. The court also found that the officers' conduct was uncontested and consisted solely of the testimony of two law enforcement officers. In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the defendant, permanently enjoining her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the officer to disgorge his or her ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations.  In a related matter, the SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage people to check the background of anyone selling or offering them advice on how to spot suspicious activity.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justice in this matter."
