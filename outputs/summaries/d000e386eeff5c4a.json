  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Javier Chandler for second-degree murder in February 2016.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, on February 22, 2016, Appellant, then a resident of Escambia County, Florida, engaged in a series of unprovoked confrontations with a man who claimed he had just purchased a gun for him.  According to the complaint, the two men had been childhood friends and, on the day of the alleged shooting, had been neighbors since childhood.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, however, the defendants had been friends since childhood, but had been estranged from each other for years.  Appellantly, as alleged, when confronted by a group of brawlers who confronted him, he allegedly replied, \"I should have killed you.\"  The complaint further alleges that Appelant, a few years' Chandler's junior, followed him into the house and demanded to know where his new gun was.

On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Donahue entered a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge his ill will, hatred, spite, and evil intent, and to pay civil penalties of $50,000 and $75,000, respectively.   The court also ordered him to surrender his passport and to be barred from associating with any third- or fourth-party dealers in the United States.  To settle his case, the court granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations, and ordered him"
