  "summary": "On May 11, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against First Government Lease Company and Paul Graver, sole owner and operator of FG, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Scott County, Arkansas, Graver and First Government misrepresented to a jury that they had received approximately $278,000 from the sale of two separate vehicles, which FG alleged were used as collateral for the loan, interest, and attorney's fees.  The complaint alleges that the jury found Graver liable for his conduct in the case and ordered him to pay $258,195 in disgorgement and $1.5 million in prejudgment interest.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, First Government and Graver have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $250,195, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against Graver.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court denied First Government's motion for a new trial and ordered Graver to comply with the court's order.  First Government agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(d) and ordering it to pay an $8,500 civil penalty and a $1 million civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Fort Worth Regional Office by Scott County District Attorney's Office staff. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. McKinley.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
