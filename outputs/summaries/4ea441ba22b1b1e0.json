  "summary": "On July 25, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia entered a default judgment against Mexican immigrant workers who were recruited through the Department of Labor's H-2A foreign agricultural worker program.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, from at least February 2018 through March 2018, Mexican workers from Mexico were recruited to bale pine straw in Georgia, promised specific wages and benefits, required them to pay substantial pre-employment expenses such as visa costs and recruitment fees while knowing that they could not afford such expenses. In addition, the complaint alleges that the Mexican workers were forced to take out loans to pay for their work, and were threatened with deportation if they left their jobs.  According to the complaint, some of the workers were so ill-prepared that they had to seek help from a local church to keep warm.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Mexican workers for their roles in the alleged ringleaders of the ringleaders' scheme.  To settle the SEC's charges, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, penalties, and injunctive relief against the defendants.  On August 2, 2020, the SEC filed a civil action against Mexican nationals for their participation in a ringleaders scheme that raised the prospect of illegal immigration from Mexico. The SEC alleges that Mexican nationals were among those recruited to work for Mexican-American companies, and that Mexican-Americans were among the first to be recruited. The complaint also alleges that Mexico-based immigrant workers were falsely told that they would be reimbursed in the first week of work, regardless of whether the worker later walks off the job.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Mexican nationals consented to entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 10(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the federal securities laws, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply for a second year of residency. The judgments also order Mexican nationals to be barred from serving as officers or directors of a public company, and to pay civil penalties of up to $100,000. The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
