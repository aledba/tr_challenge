  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Saudi Arabia and its former head of the agency for aiding and abetting the 9/11 attacks.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (the \"King Fahd\") and its then-head of the Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C., provided material support to al Qaeda in the days and weeks leading up to September 11, 2001.  According to the complaint, the King Fahd staff provided material assistance to the hijackers, including by providing them fake driver's licenses and providing them with fake passports.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Saudi Arabia provided financial and logistical support to the 11 hijackers.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Saudi Arabia is directly liable for its own tortious acts, including the 9-11 attacks, and for the receipt of millions of dollars in kickbacks and other assistance from al Qaeda.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, the Kingdom has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $3,000.  It also orders the Kingdom to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,500.   The court also ordered the Kingdom and its officers and directors to pay civil penalties of $2,500 each.  On January 18, 2018, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Mascianica of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted the Kingdom's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the repatriation of all of the funds allegedly obtained in connection with the September 11 attacks, including those allegedly used to pay for the hijacker's travel and to support al Qaeda's operations in the Middle East and elsewhere in the United States. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael G. Sansone and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by John R. Birkenheier. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom's Ministry of Islamic Affairs, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also\u00c2\u00a0check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0"
