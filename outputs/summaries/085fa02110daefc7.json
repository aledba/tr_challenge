  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in an oyster lease case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that on April 7, 2016, Tom Dinh, the owner of Tom's Marine & Salvage, LLC, sent a tugboat to Lake Pontchartrain to rescue another Oyster leaseholder who was in peril of capsizing. The complaint alleges that, when the tugboat grounded, it caused extensive damage to the leases.  According to the complaint, the trial court found that Dr. Cake, a certified oyster biologist, was not qualified as an expert because he did not have the expertise to determine the true cause of the damage.  In addition, the SEC alleges that Mr. Litolff, Mr. Porter, and Dr. Flowers provided testimony that corroborated the SEC's finding that they were entitled to compensation based on the number of oyster leases that had been lost.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, Appellees and Dinh consented to the entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and order them to pay disgorgement of $6,087,701.47, prejudgment interest of $1,150,169.70, and a civil penalty of $2,500,000.  Appellants also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock in the public company.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
