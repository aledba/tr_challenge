  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia today entered a final judgment finding Jokeera Morgan guilty but mentally ill of murdering her two infant daughters by drowning them.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, on October 6, 2015, Morgan drowned her two daughters in her home. The SEC alleges that Morgan confessed to the murders in a police interview, telling the officers that she had drowned her children because she couldn\u2019t believe that she was doing it. The complaint further alleges that the officer who performed CPR on the children told Morgan that he had never been in love with her, which Morgan said had broken her heart.  According to the complaint, the officer\u2019s statements to the officers were consistent with those of other officers who had committed \"altruistic filicide\" - a homicide that results from a belief that a child is better off dead.  In addition, the complaint alleges that in admitting the first video-recording, Morgan admitted that she knew right from wrong when she was in bed with the children and that the second video-recorded showed her struggling to revive one of the children after she caught the child in bed.  Morgan also admitted to the fact that she did not know how the children had died, despite repeated assurances from the officers and emergency medical personnel that her mental illness had rendered her unable to determine right fromwrong at a time other than that of the homicides.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Morgan consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 24-4-403 (January 24, 2019).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney\u2019S Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Morgan.  A hearing for the SEC today will be conducted by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Eric R. Werner and Carol M. McKinley of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. \u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney for New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Georgia State Department of Health and Human Services."
