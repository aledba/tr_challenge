  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment in favor of the estate of a widow who died intestate without a will.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on June 13, 2016, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pa. filed a civil injunctive action against the widow, charging her with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that the widow was entitled to a one-third stake in a revocable inter vivos trust under Section 2507 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the widow consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued an order appointing a receiver for the widow's estate, which is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation was conducted in the Philadelphia Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Philadelphia Office of Financial Regulation, and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities."
