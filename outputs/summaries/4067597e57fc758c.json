  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant who claimed that he acted in self-defense in the course of his or her wrongful conviction.  The court entered the final judgment in favor of the defendant, who, according to the court's order, was not eligible to request postconviction forensic testing pursuant to the federal securities laws.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Worcester, Massachusetts, the defendant raised the issue of whether he or she was legally innocent when, in fact, he and the victim shot each other and then engaged in a physical altercation. The complaint alleges that the defendant took a firearm and shot the victim, causing the victim to fall to the ground. The defendant then allegedly ran away for a short period of time, but did not return to shoot the victim again.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against the defendant. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Philadelphia Regional Office and the case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Timothy J. Welshhans and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The case has been supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties to be determined by the court at a later date.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 567 (2014).  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General."
