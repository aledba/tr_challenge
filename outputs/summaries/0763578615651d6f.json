  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado today entered a final judgment in favor of the defendants in a multi-year cocaine trafficking conspiracy between individuals in Mexico and Colorado.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, on November 2, 2016, the defendants agreed to be sentenced to 180 months imprisonment and five years supervised release.  The SEC alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder.  In addition, the court found that, contrary to the defendants' representations to the court, Mr. Lozano was a mere middleman who did not manage or manage any of the individuals involved in the drug-trafficking conspiracy, and that he regularly received payouts exceeding those of his co-conspirators because of his oversight and control over the criminal activity.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar. The court also granted the defendants the right to reapply for the same amount of time and the amount of money they have already paid to settle the charges against them. The SEC's investigation was conducted by David E. Schiff and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Schiff. The case is being supervised by Lara-Gallegos and Ms. Werner. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Colorado Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Colorado Department of State Office of Criminal Investigations."
