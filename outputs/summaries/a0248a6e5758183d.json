  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against two men accused of orchestrating a scheme to steal millions of dollars from elderly and ill prisoners.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boston, alleges that the Massachusetts Department of Corrections (DOL) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 119A of the Exchange Act, the DOL violated the reporting provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint further alleges that DOL failed to comply with the requirements of Sections 13(a)(1) and 13(b)(2)(A) and (3) of Section 15(d) of Exchange Act Rule 13d-1.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, DOL consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requires him to provide a copy of the medical parole plan and written diagnosis to the prisoner.  DOL also agreed to be enjoined from associating with any person or entity that may be associated with a criminal defendant with whom he or she has an interest in obtaining a medical parole.  In a parallel action, the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office today announced that it has obtained a court order freezing the assets of DOL and HHS, and ordering them to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  On May 20, 2019, the Honorable Kathleen M. Burns granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against further violations of the securities laws.  A hearing is scheduled for May 21, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 5, 2018.   The Commission's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Office of Corrections and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
