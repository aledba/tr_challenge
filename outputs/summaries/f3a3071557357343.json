  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Brattleboro, Connecticut woman who was charged with driving while intoxicated (DUI), second offense, and criminal refusal for refusing to take an evidentiary test to determine blood-alcohol concentration.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York City on October 24, 2016, defendant, who was previously convicted of DUI, agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 1201 of the federal securities laws, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  The judgment also prohibits defendants from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any intoxicating substance, including alcohol, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In addition, the court ordered her to submit to field-sobriety tests, which are designed to detect signs of impairment, such as impairment in driving while under the influence of alcohol. The court also ordered defendant to provide a sample of breath for the purpose of demonstrating consciousness of guilt to driving while impaired.  On October 26, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against defendant, charging her with violating Section 1202(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 12b-5 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  A hearing on November 2, 2018, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time. The case was being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
