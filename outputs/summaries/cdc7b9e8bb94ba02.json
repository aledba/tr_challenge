  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against four convicted sex offenders for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered final judgment against one of the defendants for violating these provisions.  According to the court's order, filed in federal district court in Newark, New Jersey, on October 6, 2016, the Board of Parole Commissioners issued a final judgment that imposed the no-Internet and no-networking special conditions on a convicted sex offender.  In its final judgment, the court found that the No-Internet special condition was unreasonable and unreasonable because it required the offender to use the Internet for any purpose other than providing for the purpose of providing for a safe and secure work environment.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  J.I., 228 N.J. at 229, 155 A.3d 1008, has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the above provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000.  On May 31, 2017, the Court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 10 of the Exchange Act and Rule10b-3 thereunder, and ordered the release of the remaining defendants.  A hearing is scheduled for June 5, 2018, for which the court will determine whether to order a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunction, and a hearing on June 12, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (January 24, 2017).  The Court also granted the request for a temporary restraining order against the defendant and ordered him to comply with the requirements of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Office of Inspector General's Criminal Investigations.  Separately, the Commission issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, ordering the receiver to conduct a background check on the receiver and to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver for further determination by the Parole Board upon motion by the receiver.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the New Jersey Office of Public Education and the Division of Corrections. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the U."
