  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment in favor of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission against Medicine Park Telephone Company, an Oklahoma-based telecommunications service provider.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, alleges that the Commission improperly denied reimbursement to Medicine Park for costs incurred to relocate its telephone facilities as required by the federal Universal Service Fund (OUSF).  The complaint further alleges that in 2014, the Commission issued an order denying reimbursement because the OUSF was not authorized to pay for such relocation costs.  According to the complaint, Medicine Park's application, completed by using a Commission-issued form, was not publicly filed with the Commission and was not subject to the Commission's approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the company for its role in the alleged violations of the federal securities laws.  Medicine Park has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $20,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the Corporation Commission agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins Medicine Park from violating these provisions and orders it to comply with the court's order. The Commission also ordered Medicine Park to provide timely and accurate accounting of its losses and to provide a timely and cost-effective response to any emergency response. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's order also prohibits Medicine Park and its affiliated entities from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any telemarketer's or related product or service, and prohibits the Commission from issuing or denying an application based on its findings or recommendations.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel administrative proceeding, the SEC filed a complaint against Oklahoma Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes for her role in this matter.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Public Finance Abuse Unit. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter, Chief of the Enforcement's Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Ms. Grimes.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-20221."
