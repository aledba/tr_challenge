  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against a former officer who was found guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol in 2015.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Officer Randy Lynn Harvey, who was standing trial for driving under-the-radar (DUI), improperly admitted that he had been drinking while operating a vehicle and failed to take a breath test to determine whether he was capable of safely operating the vehicle.  According to the complaint, Harvey also failed a field sobriety test, which is designed to detect signs of impairment such that a reasonable jury can determine whether a driver is impaired.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Harvey.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Harvey was not a qualified expert on the subject of alcohol burn-off rates.  Instead, the complaint alleges that Harvey lied to the officer about the number of alcoholic beverages he had consumed, the odor of alcohol on the defendant's breath, and the presence of a half-consumed bottle of vodka.  Harvey also allegedly told the officer that he did not drink and that he was unable to safely operate his truck because of his injuries.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Harvey consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest in the amount of his civil penalty.  On November 8, 2018, a federal district court in Utah issued an order suspending Harvey from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an expert in the field and ordering him to surrender his passport and other documents related to his arrest.  A hearing for the SEC is scheduled for March 21, 2019.  For further information, see SEC Litigation Release No. 5, 2018."
