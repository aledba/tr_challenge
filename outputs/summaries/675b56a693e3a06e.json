  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico today denied a motion by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York to revoke from the record of a defendant who was not admitted to practice law in Puerto Rico until 2013.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Juan Carlos Mercado (\u201cMercado\u201d) worked with various attorneys to obtain municipal contracts.  Mercado allegedly paid S\u00e1nchez by check and disguised the payments as legal fees.  According to the complaint, Mercado also assisted another attorney in obtaining municipal contracts, and he assisted the third party in obtaining the contracts by providing legal services and consulting.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced criminal charges against Mercado.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed on October 29, 2014, the SEC alleges that Mercado violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint or the allegations of the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $100,000, $50,000 and $50 million, respectively. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On October 31, 2019, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, and ordered Mercado to surrender his passport, which he has not yet done. The court also granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered a conduct-based injunction, and barred Mercado from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the company's operations.  A hearing for the SEC is scheduled for May 5, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018.  Separately, on October 24, 2018, a federal district court in Miami, Florida, entered a judgment ordering the SEC to issue an order requiring the issuance of a civil injunctive relief and ordering the receiver to provide a copy of the court order. The order also requires the receiver be present at all times to provide any reasonable explanation for why the payment was not made to a reasonable person."
