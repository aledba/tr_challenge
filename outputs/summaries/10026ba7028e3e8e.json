  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against Universal Protection Services, L.P., a San Diego-based private arbitration service, and its owner in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that Universal, then a Universal employee, signed an arbitration agreement in 2008 agreeing subject to some exceptions to arbitrate \"any and all disputes or claims\" between them, including disputes relating to their employment relationship and its termination, and disputes over wage and hour violations.  According to the complaint, Universal and Universal agreed that the arbitration agreement would be conducted in accordance with \"class and representative arbitration\" and that the arbitrator would determine the arbitrability of the arbitration.  In fact, Universal's arbitration agreement, which was not in existence at the time it was entered into, expressly required that the parties expressly use the words \"class arbitration\" in their agreement in order to express an intent that an arbitrator should determine whether the arbitration should proceed on a class and/or representative basis.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Universal agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Universal to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a civil penalty.  Universal also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  On November 10, 2014, the court granted Universal's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar, and ordered Universal to comply with the court's order.  As part of the settlement, Universal has agreed to pay a $1.2 million civil penalty and to pay an officer and director bar.  It has also agreed not to participate in the issuance of an arbitration order without a clear and unmistakable indication of the parties' intent to do so.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael Fagelbaum of the San Diego Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Enforcement's Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the California Office of the Attorney General."
