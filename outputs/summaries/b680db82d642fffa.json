  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was found liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that Judge B. David T. Batson improperly instructed a jury to determine whether the race of prospective jurors was sufficient to justify a Batson challenge.  According to the complaint, the jury was told that the defendant was \"merely present\" at the home when he and his girlfriend were questioned on the basis of race, and that the jury could convict him if they found that he alone or he acting in concert with [Ms. Smith] had committed the crimes.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney or a trial judge.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant and two other defendants in connection with the same conduct.  Batson also issued an order requiring the trial court to conduct a fair and impartial review of the jury selection process.  To learn more about jury selection, see Litigation Release No. 534, 546, 407 S.E.2d 703, 708.  For more information on jury selection and how to spot potential bias in the criminal justice system, see Criminal Justice Reform Task Force v. Kelly, 206 N.C. 514, 527, 669 S.D. 1, 15.  On May 2, 2020, the Honorable Judge Batson granted the SEC\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered the jury to consider the merits of the case before proceeding with a judgment imposing an order imposing a preliminary injunction, ordering a conduct-based injunction, and ordering the court to issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the selection of a jury.  A hearing for the receiver will be conducted by Judge T. David Fraser, with the assistance of Assistant Chief of the SEC Division of Criminal Justice, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David Fraser and Eric Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Fraser and Mr. Werner under the supervision of Ms. Kelly."
