  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the school district in a civil action brought by a former high school student alleging that from 1993 to 1994, her cross-country and track coach, who was defendant\u2019s employee, sexually molested her.  The court found that the statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse is one year.  According to the court order, Shirk, a California resident, was exposed to asbestos from the early 1940s to 1963 and was not disabled.  As alleged in the complaint, however, she learned from a mental health professional that her adult-onset emotional problems resulted from the teacher molestation of her as a teenager, when she was a teenager.  Shirk also alleged that she had only recently discovered that her present psychological injury was caused by the sexual abuse of her when she first learned of it.  In addition, the court ruled that Shirk could not take advantage of the three-year delay in filing her claim.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's order, the district agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins Shirk from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Shirk to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also granted the district's request for a temporary restraining order, which is subject to court approval.  On June 9, 2008, the Court of Appeal granted the District of Columbia's motion for a preliminary injunction against Shirk and ordered her to comply with the order.  A hearing on June 10, 2009, was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. for Shirk.  To learn more about this matter, see Litigation Release Release No. 582-583, July 14, 2008.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by Marc Blau of the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Timothy J. Burt. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Education, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter."
