  "summary": "On February 5, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of West Virginia entered a final judgment against the Bureau of Prisons and individual officers employed at Federal Correctional Institution Gilmer, West Virginia.  The SEC's complaint alleges that on May 2, 2013, while incarcerated at the prison, another inmate stabbed him multiple times with a Phillips-head screwdriver in the prison dining room.  According to the complaint, Evans submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the Bureau, seeking to compel the release of records related to the screwdriver, as well as surveillance footage of the episode.  As alleged, the Bureau's response to Evans\u2019s request was inadequate because it failed to provide any reasonable explanation as to why it could not segregate the footage.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for West Virginia today announced criminal charges against Evans, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the agency consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from future violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $14,320. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On February 6, 2019, the court granted the SEC and the Bureau a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $20,000. The court also granted the FBI and the Department of Justice an expedited review of its response to the same request.  To learn more about FOIA, see Press Release No. 552(b)(7)(A) and Press Release no. 551 (B.C. Cir. 1997).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Joseph G. Sansone, Director of the SEC's Office of Regulatory Affairs. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General in this matter."
