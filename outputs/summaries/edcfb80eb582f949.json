  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against defendant W. Riley Allen for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that Allen violated Section 768.79 of the Exchange Act by making separate, nearly simultaneous offers for settlement.  According to the complaint, Allen offered to settle his claims against his father, Jairo Nunez, without admitting or denying the SEC's findings.  As alleged, however, the offer was ambiguous and unenforceable because it did not address separate pending claims of other parties.  Specifically, the complaint alleges that, when read as a whole, Allen was entitled to be reimbursed $343,590 in attorney's fees and $20,000 in prejudgment interest.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Florida today announced criminal charges against Allen arising out of the same conduct alleged in the complaint.  On May 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Allen, charging him with violations of Section 13(b)(2)(A) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and aiding and abetting Allen's violations of Sections 13(a)(1) and 13(c)(3) and (3) thereunder, and the SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and permanent injunctions against Allen and Jairo, as well as an officer-and-director bar against Allen.   The court also issued an order suspending Allen from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and ordering him to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his fees, if any, to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals or professionals.  For example, in one case, a registered representative filed a complaint for breach of contract with the SEC alleging that she was liable for her husband's negligent driving and that her husband had been negligent in his role as an insurance agent.  A federal district court in Florida also issued a temporary restraining order against Allen from violating the federal securities laws. "
