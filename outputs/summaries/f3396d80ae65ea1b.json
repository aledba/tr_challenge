  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Massage Envy-South Tampa, LLC, a Tampa, Florida-based massage and skin care franchise, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, Massage opened its doors to prospective employees in Ghana in October 2014, and hired Kimberly Lowe, a certified personal assistant, as a massage therapist. As alleged in the complaint, Lowe was not disabled when she was terminated, but rather, she had an association with a person who had become ill with Ebola while traveling in Ghana. The complaint further alleges that, although Lowe had a history of having developed Ebola, she did not have an actual physical or mental impairment at the time she was fired. In addition, the complaint alleges that Massage's termination was based on Lowe\u2019s fear that she would come into contact with an unknown person having Ebola while in Ghana, and that the termination decision was based upon her fears and beliefs about the potential impact of the Ebola virus on her work.  The complaint also alleges that Wuchko, a former Massage employee, pressured Lowe to cancel her Ghana trip because he believed that Lowe had an existing or perceived disability.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Health and Human Services (OHS) today announced that it has issued an alert warning employees to look out for suspicious activity in the background of any potential Ebola threat. The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued a Complaint to the Office of Compliance, which is investigating the matter. The Complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Division of Economic and Risk Analysis and the Division of Justice have issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the backgrounds of people selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Florida, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
