  "summary": "On March 2, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Keith Davis, Jr., a defendant who was arrested for possession of a stolen vehicle and subsequently charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court found that Davis waived his right to be present at trial by voluntarily absenting himself from the courtroom.  According to the court's order, Davis, who was previously convicted of felony theft and sentenced to 15 years in prison, repeatedly asked for a temporary restraining order and to be allowed to use the restroom.  Davis allegedly told the court that he did not want to leave the courtroom, that he was prepared to defend himself, and that the court could hold his trial without him.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Davis.  On February 27, 2017 the court granted Davis's request for a continuance and ordered him to appear for trial.  As set forth in the order, the court determined that Davis was not ready to go to trial and that he should be removed as his own counsel.  Without admitting or denying the Court's findings, Davis consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  A hearing scheduled for March 1, 2018, Judge Julie Spector of the New York District Court issued an order requiring the court to determine whether Davis was entitled to a hearing-within-a-reasonable period of time to consider whether to remove him from the court.  Judge Spector agreed to the order and ordered Davis to comply with the order.  After a hearing on March 4, 2019, Davis again asked the court for a hearing and to consider a preliminary finding of voluntariness, which the court agreed to.  At the hearing, Davis agreed to be removed from the case.  He also agreed to a preliminary injunction prohibiting him from participating in the conduct of any jury selection, and to a conduct-based injunction barring him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  To settle the case, Davis also agreed not to participate in the selection of a jury, to be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations, to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $100,000.   The trial court also agreed that Davis could not be present as a defendant and that Davis"
