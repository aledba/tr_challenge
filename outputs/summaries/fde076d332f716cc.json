  "summary": "On April 24, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri entered a final judgment against Anheuser-Busch, Inc. (A-B) and its former market manager, John Esser, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, alleges that A-B violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to show that they had accepted or agreed to the delegation provision of the arbitration agreement, and that, in fact, they had not.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, as a result of the defendants\u2019 failure to demonstrate clear and unmistakable intent to arbitrate, they were not required to sign or otherwise affirm the delegation provisions of the agreement.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, An-B and Esser consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws and order them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,038, which is equal to the amount of any other civil monetary penalty.  A settlement is pending final approval by the court.  On May 9, 2017, the Missouri Court of Appeals granted the SEC request for an emergency asset freeze and entered a temporary restraining order against the defendants, ordering them to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and permanent injunctions.

Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, the SEC\u00c2\u00a0recently issued an investor alert\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0an investor should check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0search tool to identify\u00c2\u00a0people selling investments in\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov and\u00c2\u00a0find\u00c2\u00a0companies selling investments that are not subject to SEC approval.\u00c2\u00a0In a separate case, a federal district court in Kansas City, Missouri issued an order requiring the SEC to"
