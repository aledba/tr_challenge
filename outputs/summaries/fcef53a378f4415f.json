  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against defendant Ronald Jay Richins, finding him liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Richins engaged in a pattern of lewd acts in which he exposed himself to other women.  According to the complaint, Richins told one of the women that he had exposed himself in public and that he was \"creepy\" and \"preconditioned to think that something bad might happen.\"  The complaint further alleges that the woman told Richins that she had been made aware by multiple neighbors of Richins\u2019s prior acts of exposing himself, and that she was mistaken in her belief that she saw Richins exposing himself.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Utah today announced criminal charges against Richins.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's findings, the defendants agreed to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from future violations of the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties of up to $100,000.  Richins also agreed to pay a $75,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott A. Mascianica of the Salt Lake Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Enforcement's Salt Lake Division of Criminal Investigations. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Utah Office of Inspector General in this matter."
