  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against Justyn R. Schlegel, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 40 years in prison for second-degree murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on the morning of July 14, 2015, the Neshoba County Sheriff's Department and the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation (MBI) unlawfully entered into evidence a video recording purportedly from a jail cell that purportedly showed the defendant stomping on Henry's feet.  According to the complaint, the video recording allegedly was from a video camera facing a different angle than the one shown in the recording.  As alleged in the complaint:  The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to show sufficient evidence to show that the defendant did not stomp on Henry, or that he had suffered from plantar fasciitis.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Schlegeel.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the assets of the defendants and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  On August 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-officer bar.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar against them.  Finally, the court granted the defendants' motion for a hearing on August 24, 2019, and ordered the SEC to conduct a preliminary examination of the evidence in the case. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the Mississippi Department of Criminal Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigations."
