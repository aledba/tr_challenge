  "summary": "On July 29, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Xavier Lee Holliday, Jr., a Rock Island, Illinois man who was found guilty of two felony counts of possession with intent to deliver more than 500 grams but not more than 2000 grams of a substance containing cannabis (720 ILCS 550/5(a) (West 2012).  Holliday was sentenced to four years of imprisonment and two years of mandatory supervised release (MSR).  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, charges Holliday with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Illinois Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The complaint also seeks an officer-and-director bar against Holliday.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced that it has filed an emergency action to halt Holliday's pending sentencing.  According to the SEC's order, Holliday pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful possession of a controlled substance and agreed to be permanently enjoined from further violations of the federal securities laws and to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer- and director-and/director-bar.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order filed in the SEC case, defendant Holliday consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, and orders him to pay $10,000 in disgorgment, $1.5 million in prejudgment interests, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The court also ordered Holliday to pay an $8,500 civil penalty in the amount of $2,500. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On August 2, 2017, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, a temporary asset freeze, and an order suspending Holliday from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
