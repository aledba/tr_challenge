  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two men who were found guilty of committing an armed bank robbery.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Juan, Puerto Rico, alleges that Virgilio Diaz-Jimenez and Hector Serrano-Acevedo violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to show that a warrantless search of a defendant's home violated the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the search was conducted in conjunction with the arrest of a third individual in the bank robbery, and Serrano and Diaz agreed to the search without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint. The complaint also alleges that Serrano consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\").  The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against Serrano.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Puerto Rico today announced criminal charges against both defendants.  On June 17, 2013, the court granted a motion to suppress the evidence uncovered during the search of Diaz's home, which was conducted with the assistance of an FBI agent in charge, and ordered the SWAT team to enter the home. The court granted the request for the asset freeze and ordered Serrano to comply with the court order. The case is being supervised by Ansu Banerjee, Chief of the San Juan Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Puerto Rico Police Department, and the Puerto Rican Attorney General's Office in connection with this matter."
