  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina today entered a final judgment against a North Carolina man who was convicted of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, on May 5, 2017, defendant-father-in-law Tanya Christian Services (BCS) agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 7B-1110 of the Exchange Act.  The complaint alleges that the trial court improperly failed to consider all of the relevant facts concerning the likelihood of adoption, whether the termination was in the children\u2019s best interests, and whether the bond between the children was in place.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Carolina today announced criminal charges against Tanya.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, BCS consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties.  BCS also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $3361, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Advocacy and Education has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage parents to check the backgrounds of their children by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's\u00c2\u00a0Adoption.gov website.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Children and Families in this matter."
