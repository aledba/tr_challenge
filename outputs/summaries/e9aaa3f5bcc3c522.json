  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a Missouri man who was convicted of failing to provide a self-defense instruction.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, alleges that Andrew Barnett violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Barnett, who was charged with first-degree assault and armed criminal action, was asked by the court if he had ever stabbed a victim in self-defence, and he adamantly denied stabbing the victim. The SEC alleges that, on the night of the alleged attack, Barnett confronted Barnett from behind and demanded that he go outside so the two could fight. The complaint alleges that Barnett refused to comply with the court\u2019s order, and instead continued urinating near a dumpster. The court found that, after viewing all the evidence presented to the court, Barnett was not entitled to the instruction because he had not stabbed the victim, and the two got into a physical altercation. In response, Barnett allegedly knocked Victim's hand away, shoved Victim to the ground, and left the scene.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Barnett.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Barnett consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 541 (Mo. banc 1996).  The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit."
