The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Gretna, New York, alleges that, on April 6, 2015, defendant Elvin D. Villafranca and two co-defendants engaged in a sexual battery of a juvenile under the age of 13.  According to the complaint, the defendants entered into an agreement to pay a penalty of 25 years imprisonment without benefit of parole, 30 years of supervised release, and a five-year officer-and-director bar, with the option of a permanent injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws.

District Judge in New York granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return to their respective homes.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint filed in the SEC, defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty of $1,000, and an officer and director bar against them.
