  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida today entered a final judgment against a South Korean man for causing severe emotional distress.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Tampa, Florida, alleges that defendant Jung Chang violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jung Chang.  According to the SEC, Jung Chang agreed to lend $164,050 to Mr. Kim, which came from the proceeds of a life insurance policy paid to Ms. Chang when her husband died. The SEC alleges that Kim did not then demand repayment of the loan. Instead, according to the complaint, he allegedly used the money to make improvements to his store and to make purchases at the grocery store.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the SEC also alleges that Jung Chang failed to adequately disclose to the jury that she suffered severe distress from her conduct.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC in its Complaint and in its Order of Practice, the Court granted Jung Chang's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the federal securities laws and ordered Jung Chang to pay $15,000 in disgorgement, $165,000 of prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $900,000.  Jung Chang consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and (e) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act, and orders her to pay a $150,000 civil penalty. The judgment also prohibits Jung Chang from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply as an officer or director of a public company after five years of law enforcement service.  On the other hand, the court has issued a temporary restraining order, ordering Jung Chang and Sook Chang to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains with interest, imposing civil penalties, and imposing an officer-and-director bar.  A hearing for Jung Chang is scheduled for May 24, 2013.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 17-cv-01-11, Lit. 206, 206, 207, 207.  Judgment No. 13-cv 13-14, 206-1, 207-2, 207 (Dec. 13, 2013).  The court's order freezes the defendants' assets and prohibits them from further violating the securities laws."
