  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the City of San Buenaventura for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, California, alleges that the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) improperly imposed a five-year water use limitation on the amount of water that can be diverted from the Ventura River watershed. The complaint also alleges that, as a matter of law, the City has no right to divert water from the river, and that it has no duty to do so. The SEC alleges that DWR has a duty to protect the water rights of other water users in the watershed, including for endangered, spawning, and young fish. The Complaint further alleges that as a result of DWR\u2019s actions, the city has failed to comply with the DWR rule, which requires all water users to be responsible for the use of water. DWR seeks a judgment ordering a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal and state water laws, and a civil injunctive proceeding against DWR. The court also issued a temporary restraining order halting the City from violating the federal, state, and local water laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the city.  On December 14, 2015, the court granted the SEC's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered a hearing on the merits of the matter, and ordered a preliminary examination of the proposed injunction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, DWR consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins DWR from violating these provisions, and orders DWR to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2019).
