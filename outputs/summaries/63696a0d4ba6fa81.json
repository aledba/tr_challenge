  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the County of Monterey and Omni Resources LLC in an administrative proceeding related to a shopping center project.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Monterey County, California, Omni Resources sought County approval for construction of a retail center on 11 acres located at the intersection of Highway 68 and Corral de Tierra Road.  The complaint alleges that the County failed to consider the many issues raised in the complaint, including the fact that the project had a long-term, sustainable water supply, and that the water recharge system approved for the project would return 9.66 acre-feet of water to the project site, which results in a net positive water balance for operation of the shopping center.  In addition, the complaint alleged that the county failed to analyze the water supply and quality of the project and to consider whether the project was consistent with the County\u2019s general plan and its plans.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Omni and the County consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. \u00c2\u00a0The court also granted the County and Omni a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the issuance of an emergency court order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Compliance and Assurance, with the assistance of the California Office of Environmental Quality, the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General, and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Albers and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The SEC encourages the public to check the backgrounds of people who are practicing or practicing law by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals."
