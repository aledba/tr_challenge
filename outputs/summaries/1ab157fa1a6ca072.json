  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia today announced criminal charges against Dustin Scott Jones for his role in an attempted robbery.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that, on October 6, 2015, Jones, then a resident of Virginia Beach, Florida, engaged in an act of attempted robbery by purchasing a sawed-off shotgun and then entering the home of a known drug dealer. According to the complaint, Jones and his co-conspirator, Phillip Boyce, entered the home and prepared to rob the drug dealer, Austin Strickland, who had intended to commit the robbery. The complaint alleges that Jones and Boyce then entered the house and began to steal the drug, which was intended to be used to commit an additional felony. As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, Jones did not commit the intended robbery. Instead, the complaint alleges, Jones took steps to conceal his intent by purchasing the shotgun and by placing it in his pocket. The SEC complaint charges Jones with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Jones consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for Eastern Virginia today filed criminal charges in the case against Jones. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the SEC Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson under the supervision of Senior Trial Counsel Robert C. Hannan."
