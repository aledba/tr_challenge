  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment in favor of the city of Glendale in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that, on September 4, 2011, a California-based electrical power company failed to maintain a battery backup system at an intersection during a power outage. According to the complaint, the battery backup unit was not operational when the power outage caused the intersection to go dark. The complaint further alleges that the company, doing business as Republic ITS, did not perform a duty of care to protect the safety of its customers, including those who were injured in the accident. The SEC alleges that defendant negligently failed to install the batteries and failed to provide a sufficient safety net to prevent the impact of the electrical power outage on the customers.  In its judgment, the court held that defendants owed no duty to third persons under the negligent undertaking theory, and that the duty to perform was established by a statutory presumption applicable to public entities.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 1714 of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a penny stock bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1714, July 17, 2018. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.

The court also issued an order requiring the company to provide an accounting of its losses, including the amount of any civil penalties, to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.    In a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today announced that it has obtained a preliminary injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, as well as an order appointing a receiver"
