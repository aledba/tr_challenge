  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the parents of M.S., a child with a developmental disability who was removed from public school for the 2016\u20132017 school year.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, on June 9, 2016, the Yorktown Central School District filed a due-process complaint against the district alleging that it failed to provide sufficient information to determine whether a 12:1+1 class size was appropriate for the child.  The complaint alleges that the district failed to inform the parents that it was unable to offer the 12: 1+2 class size it had recommended in the June 2016 IEP.  In addition, the complaint alleges the district did not provide the parents with a copy of the IEP when they received it.  As alleged in the complaint, the district's IEP did not include a class size for the student, and did not consider the fact that the student was not taking ADHD medication.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the District consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the district from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the district to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the New York Office of Education and the Division of Education's Office of Inspector General. The litigation will be led by Mr. Mascianica. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Education, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the Federal Education Regulatory Authority."
