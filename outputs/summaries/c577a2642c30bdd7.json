  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Christopher M. Sr., a California man charged with failing to provide for his son's well-being.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Christopher M., a six-year-old son of a convicted felon, was placed with his half brother, David M. M., who was incarcerated while Christopher was in the custody of his mother.  The complaint alleges that, while incarcerated, Christopher's mother designated a maternal uncle and a family friend as prospective caregivers for Christopher.  As alleged in the complaint, the mother did not want Christopher to be a dependent child because she was unable to provide him with the necessities of life, including food, clothing, shelter and medical care.  In addition, the complaint alleged that father failed to provide Christopher with adequate food and shelter.  Christopher's half brother and sister-in-law, Ruben and Ruben, were also placed with father.  On May 21, 2013, the court granted father's section 388 petition seeking to be found Christopher's presumed father and to have the jurisdictional and dispositional orders vacated on the basis that father had not received proper notice of the court's jurisdictional findings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Christopher consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.95 plus prejudgment interest of $2,077.95 and a civil penalty of $100,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John M. Rymas of the Los Angeles Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Division of Children and Family Services. The litigation will be led by Nicholas T. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
