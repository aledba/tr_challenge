  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against two former FBI agents for their roles in a drug-trafficking scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, alleges that former FBI agent Dante Jackson provided material assistance to a Miami Beach fire inspector who was under investigation for an unrelated murder investigation and maintaining an improper relationship with a former FBI confidential source.  According to the complaint, Jackson told Jackson that he would like to transport \"ten keys\" of \"cocaine\" in a duffel bag to the hospital where the fire inspector was being extorted.  Jackson allegedly told the agent that he did not want the drugs to be picked up by police, and that he was going to use the car to transport the money.  In reality, Jackson was not a registered FBI source and could not obtain the evidence to support his claims.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Jackson provided Jackson with the coordinates to a hospital where he was being escorting the illegal drugs.  He also allegedly told Jackson he would provide police escorts to escort the drugs through the nightclub.  At trial, the jury found Jackson liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Jackson was found liable for aiding and abetting Jackson's violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint or the SEC, Jackson has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Bryant has also agreed to settle the SEC\u2019s charges against him by consenting to a permanent injunction and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from associating with any third-party criminal or administrative law violator.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Amy C. Mascianica of the United States District Court for the Central District of Florida granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order against Jackson, ordering him to surrender his passport, and imposing a $25,000 civil penalty against him.  A hearing on June 11, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Miami Regional Office, and the Miami Office of Inspector General."
