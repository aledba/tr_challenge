  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Massachusetts today entered final judgments against Econo-Tennis Management Corp. and Dedham Health and Athletic Complex, a Massachusetts-based company that sells and services to retail customers.  According to the court's order, the defendants withdrew their tax abatement petitions from the Appellate Tax Board in 2004.  The court found that the defendants had a substantial interest in collecting and remitting the taxes imposed on the service contracts, and that they had no intention or incentive to intervene to protect that interest.  In addition, the court ruled that the sellers had no right to withdraw their requests, and instead sought an injunction to halt the withdrawals.  As alleged in the court order, however, the sellers withdrew their requests and the court granted the sellers' requests for an injunction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendants to pay disgorgement of $215.55, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Dedham health has also agreed to pay a $50,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.
