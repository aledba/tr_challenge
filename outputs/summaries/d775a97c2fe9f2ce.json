  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Greg Shows and Hope Shows Cross.  According to the SEC's complaint filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, Greg Shows, then a fourth-grader, was in fourth grade and almost ten years old when he was arrested by Hope's family for allegedly causing a disturbance in their home.  The complaint alleges that Greg was in contempt for failing to return S.S.'s father, Kenny Shows, to visitation after Hope's divorce, and that he had been in contempt of Hope's court for refusing to grant him visitation the weekend before Thanksgiving in November 2015.  Greg also alleged that Hope and her family had attacked him in Amory, Georgia and that his stepfather had slapped his stepsister at Greg's house.  As alleged in the complaint, Hope and Greg agreed that Greg should pay a minimum of $335 per month, even if no daycare expenses were incurred.  In addition, Greg alleges that Hope had threatened him with physical harm if he did not comply with the court's order to modify custody.    The SEC alleges that the court found that Greg violated the custody and property settlement provisions of the divorce decree and that Greg had violated the child support and visitation provisions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Greg has consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Additionally, the court granted Hope's request for a temporary restraining order, which requires her to pay child support in the amount of $200,000, and ordered Greg to pay $135,000 in attorney's fees.  On May 24, 2016, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Mississippi against Hope, alleging that she violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeking a permanent injunction against Greg from violating the charged provision of the federal securities laws, as well as Section 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17(b)(5) thereunder. \u00c2\u00a0The complaint also alleges that Gregory violated Section 15(a)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 10a-5 and that Hope violated Exchange Act Rules 15a-1 and Rule 15b2-3 thereunder by failing to comply with Exchange Act Order 13a-11, and by not paying the GAL's final $7,695, which the chancellor found to be insufficient to support Greg's child support obligation.  Finally, the complaint charges Greg with violating Section 15A of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act"
