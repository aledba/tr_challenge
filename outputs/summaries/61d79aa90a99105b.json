  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Alexandria residents who filed a complaint in federal court in Alexandria, Louisiana, alleging that the City of Alexandria overcharged its customers for a period of time dating from 1997 to the present.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on September 27, 2017, the Alexandria residents raised the issue of whether or not to file a civil injunctive action against the city of Alexandria based on its July 20, 2017 order that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over municipal utilities.  The complaint alleges that, contrary to the court's order, the defendants' claim advanced a \"rate claim\" under which the city had primary jurisdiction over public utilities, and that such overcharges resulted from \"the City's incorrect calculations of the fuel adjustment costs for electricity and the incorrect application of the monthly fuel adjustment rates.\"  As alleged, the complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to timely respond to the City Council's order by filing a second-filed petition with the court.  In its judgment, the court found that the city lacked jurisdiction over the complaint, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of their disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to the issuance of an order appointing an administrative law judge to review the complaint. The judgment also granted the defendants the right to return to the trial court upon completion of their litigation. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by the Office of the United States District Judge in the Alexandria Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Basinger and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Assistant Chief of the Alexandria Division of Criminal Justice. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Louisiana, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Alexandria Office of Inspector General in this matter."
