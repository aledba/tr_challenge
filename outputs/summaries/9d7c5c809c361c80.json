  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Texas today entered a final judgment against 20/20 Communications, Inc., a national direct-sales and marketing company based in Fort Worth, Texas, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, the defendants agreed to submit to arbitration a class-action waiver without admitting or denying any of the claims raised in the complaint.  The SEC alleges that, in addition to agreeing to the waiver, the parties also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to have an arbitrator determine whether the arbitration should proceed as a class.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  On May 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Fifth Circuit entered a temporary restraining order against the Defendants from violating the provisions of the federal securities laws and ordered the defendants to pay $1.5 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of their civil penalties.   The court also issued an order suspending the defendants from participating in any class-arbitration proceeding and ordering them to pay civil penalties of $2,500 each. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Complaint charges the Defendants with violating the above-mentioned provisions and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the securities laws, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The Court appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Insurance, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Texas Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1717, July 17, 2018."
