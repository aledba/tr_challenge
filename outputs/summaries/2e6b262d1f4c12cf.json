  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Franklin Moser, a physician, in a medical malpractice action.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Moser violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1431 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 1431-2 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Moser was the only defendant found at fault for noneconomic damages, and was entitled to an offset of $250,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Moser.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, the defendants agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  Moser also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $1.45 million, which is equal to the amount of his civil monetary penalty.  On May 2, 2019, the U. S. District Judge for the Central District of Florida granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered the defendants to pay civil penalties of $125,000 each, and ordered Moser to pay disgorgement of $16,655, prejudgment interest of $2,655 and a civil monetary bar of $150,000, and to pay an offset against the amount paid to the settling defendants in the alternative.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and whether they have any vested property right in a particular measure of damages.  For example, the SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
