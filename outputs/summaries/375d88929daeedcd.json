  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio today entered final judgments against the Ohio Department of Housing and Urban Development (BDO) in a case that was investigated by the Ohio Office of Inspector General.  The SEC's complaint alleges that the Ohio Division of Enforcement (OIE) improperly relied upon the valuation of a residential property developed as low-income housing under Section 202 of the federal program.  According to the complaint, the OIE improperly relied on a valuation methodology that used below-market contract rents rather than market rents.  In addition, the complaint alleged that the valuation methodology used by the BDO improperly failed to consider the true value of the property.  For example, as the complaint alleges, the county's valuation methodology was not deferential to the valuation methods used by BDO, and the valuation method relied on the inflated value of government-subsidized properties.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (\"Advisers\").  The final judgments, which are subject to court approval, order the county to comply with the court's order, impose a $75,000 civil penalty, and order the valuation to be determined by the auditor at a later date upon motion by the court.   The court also ordered the auditor to determine the appropriate valuation for the property based on the facts of the case.  Finally, the court granted the request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the county from issuing or selling any security or other security, and ordered a hearing on the merits of the matter before it was decided whether to proceed with a hearing or to issue an order imposing a preliminary injunction. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the Chicago Regional Office, and is being supervised by Marc Blau of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, the FBI, the IRS Criminal Investigation Division, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Ohio Bureau of Securities and Exchange Commission."
