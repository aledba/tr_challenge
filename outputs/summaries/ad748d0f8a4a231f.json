  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered final consent judgments in a double jeopardy case against a Washington, D.C., man who was convicted of first-degree rape and felony murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, alleges that Bisir Bilal Muhammad violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the SEC obtained a search warrant for Muhammad\u2019s car after learning that he was going to a local grocery store to purchase a new car. The SEC alleges that the warrantless search, which was conducted without a warrant, resulted in the destruction of evidence in the car.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced that it filed criminal charges against Muhammad for the same conduct alleged in the SEC complaint.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Muhammad consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The court also granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the name of the company or entity with which he or she obtained the security deposit, and requires him to provide a copy of the complaint to the court.  On November 10, 2014, a federal district court in Alexandria, Virginia, entered consent judgments against Muhammad, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and ordering him also to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000.  A hearing on the final judgment was scheduled for May 24, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-14 (2014).  The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.   The litigation will be led by John R. Rymas. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of Inspector General, and the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia."
