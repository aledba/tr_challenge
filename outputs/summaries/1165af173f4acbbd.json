  "summary": "On September 22, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment in favor of the Ohio Attorney General's Office (\"AGO\") motion to reopen an ongoing criminal case against Asadi-Ousley.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, alleges that, in July 2015, Asadi Ousley was charged in a seven-count indictment with two counts of felonious assault.  According to the complaint, the defendant told his girlfriend that one or possibly two suspects were involved in the attack, one of whom had a knife, and the other had a gun.  He allegedly held the knife to her neck and kicked her in the head, causing her to lose consciousness.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant for his role in the alleged crime.  On September 21, 2016, the Court granted the AGO's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against him from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the AGDO has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for October 26, 2017.   The AGO will consider the merits of the proposed settlement before proceeding with the litigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments in an investment in a real estate development.  Investors can also check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.  For example, the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Department of Banking and Securities, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Internal Revenue Service (FINRA), and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
