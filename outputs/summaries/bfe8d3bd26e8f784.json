  "summary": "On January 20, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa entered a final judgment against Daniel Lynn Brown, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to 150 months in prison.  According to the court's order, Brown pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of the federal securities laws.  The court found that Brown violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Brown agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions and to be barred from serving any prison term longer than five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in Brown's motion, Brown consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his sentence.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced criminal charges against Brown.  On January 21, 2020, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Brown, charging him with violating Section 924(c)(1)(A) and (b)(2)(B).  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael E. Horowitz and Rosalind Sargent-Burns of the SEC's Chicago Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Minnesota Department of Corrections, the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services, the Missouri Department of Banking and Insurance, the Illinois Department of Insurance, and other state agencies."
