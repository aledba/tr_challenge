  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania man charged with defrauding a third party out of more than $1 million.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 11, 2018, Michael Kane, a resident of Upland, Pennsylvania, allegedly engaged in sexual activity with a woman he met through a mutual friend.  The complaint alleges that Kane told the woman that he was attracted to her because he had a \"close relationship\" with her stepson.  As alleged in the complaint, Kane also allegedly had a romantic relationship with the woman.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Appellee for his role in the alleged misconduct.  On May 16, 2018 the Pennsylvania Court of Criminal Appeals issued an order requiring Appelman to present evidence of prior, consensual sexual conduct with the victim.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, Appelman has consented to the entry of an order that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,078.71, prejudgment interest of $2,038.81, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Appelle has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty in the amount of $20,000, which will be determined by the court at a later date.
