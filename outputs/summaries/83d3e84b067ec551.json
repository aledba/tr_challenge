  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Ray Ojeda, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that, in 2015, a federal district court in Jackson County, Mississippi, issued a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from participating in a future Batson challenge.  In its judgment, the court found that, contrary to the defendant\u2019s representations, the defendant was not fit to be a juror based solely on race, and that he had a bias against the criminal justice system because of his prior experience with law enforcement.  According to the complaint, the jury found that Juror R.P. had shown no evidence of race-based or race-neutral discrimination when confronted by the prosecutor.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Judge Batson granted the motion for a temporary restraining order, ordered the defendant to surrender his passport, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The court also granted the defendant the right to reapply for a second time in a matter of weeks.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in Jackson, Mississippi entered a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to comply with the court order, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty against him.  A hearing scheduled for May 26, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Denver Office of Criminal Investigations, and the Denver Field Office of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Colorado.  For further information, see the SEC's Complaint Release No. 17-cv-01221 (January 17, 2018).
