  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against E. I. duPont de Nemours and Company (\"DuPont\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, since the 1950s, DuPont has released C-8 directly into surface waters and unlined landfills, knowing that it had no reason to believe that the chemical could cause serious harm to humans.  According to the complaint, Dr. Redlich's testimony, which was filed in the SEC's Jackson Regional Office, demonstrates that DuPont is proactive and diligent in evaluating the safety and efficacy of its use and stewardship of the chemical.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the court's order, Du Pont has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced criminal charges against DuPont for its role in this matter.  On August 24, 2015, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants from future securities law violations.  To learn more about this matter, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17 (January 24, 2014).  The complaint also seeks a preliminary injunction, an officer and director bar, and a penny stock bar.  For further information see Lit. Release No-14-cv (January 23, 2014) and Lit. Exchange No. 13-cv. (July 24, 2013).  In its order, the court also ordered DuPont to provide a copy of the final judgment, which is subject to court approval.  It also ordered the company to provide an accounting of its compliance with the relevant industry standards, including the reporting, testing, and certification requirements.  DuPont also agreed to pay a $10,000 civil penalty, and to a $20,000 penalty.  Finally, the Court granted the company's motion for a hearing and ordered a temporary restraining order against further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws.   The court also issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the safety, efficacy, and safety of its products and services before it can issue an order imposing an injunction."
