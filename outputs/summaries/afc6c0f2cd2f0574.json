  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia today announced criminal charges against a convicted felon who allegedly used social media to post videos and photographs showing himself in the possession of a large-capacity magazine.  According to the SEC's complaint, on January 13, 2017, an ATF firearms expert reviewed Mr. Little's social media profiles and identified two other pistols, a Ruger P Series pistol and an AP9 pistol. The expert also recognized four large plastic bags that appeared to contain marijuana.  The complaint alleges that, in a parallel action, the federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, issued a final judgment that permanently enjoins Little from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his sentence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Little has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to be barred from the securities industry, and imposing a five-year officer-and-director bar.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing Little\u2019s assets, and issuing a civil injunctive order against him.  On March 28, 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York entered final judgments against the defendants, ordering them to pay $1,078 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and a civil penalty of $2,077. The court also ordered the defendants to pay restitution in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
