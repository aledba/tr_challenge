  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against a father and mother who were charged with child abuse and neglect.  The court entered the final judgments without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  On September 27, 2013, the court entered a final judgment that permanently enjoins the father from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar against him.  In a parallel action, on September 29, 2013 and November 29, 2014, the Court granted the father's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered a hearing on the matter.  According to the court's order, filed in federal court in New York, the father and the mother initially raised concerns about the safety of their children, including that the father had been abusive to Nora and had suffered severe head trauma.  As alleged in the court order, however, this was not the case.  Instead, the complaint alleges that, while in the care of the father, Nora became fussy and started showing signs of seizure activity.  After being taken to a local hospital, she presented with seizure activity, which, according to the complaint, was consistent with the medical evidence that she had received from the father who had suffered a traumatic head trauma, and that, in the absence of any reasonable explanation for such an event, the child was likely to have suffered a severe brain injury.  To resolve the issue of whether the father was responsible for the child's injuries, a court order appointing an emergency room physician to look for any evidence of an injury or a potential trauma was sufficient to establish a prima facie case of child abuse or neglect. The court also granted the mother's request to have a hearing in which she will determine whether to consent to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and ordering an officer and director bar against her.  A hearing on October 21, 2013 was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. EST. The hearing will be led by John T. Sansone and Amy Gwiazda. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Office of Health and Human Services."
