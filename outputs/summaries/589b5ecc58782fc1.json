  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Texas today entered a final judgment against two entities for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in El Paso, Texas, alleges that two entities, Encore Enterprises, Inc. and Encore MF Sendero, LP, violated Section 9.10 of the Contribution Agreement, which provides for arbitration of all disputes arising out of the parties' contracts.  According to the complaint, the parties agreed to settle the case by agreeing to the entry of an arbitration clause that would permit the parties to jointly and severally resolve any disputes arising from the parties\u2019 contracts. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Borderplex has agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws, requires it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and requires a court-ordered injunction.  In a parallel action, the Texas Secretary of State today announced criminal charges against one of the defendants for defrauding investors in a multi-million dollar oil and gas development project. The SEC also announced an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order against the defendants.  On June 29, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Encore, alleging that it violated the federal, state, and municipal securities laws by failing to comply with a court order requiring it to enter into an arbitration agreement. The complaint also alleges that Encore failed to adequately disclose to investors that it was in default under its contract for failing to make the initial closing of the project.  Encore has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorged gains received by the parties in the settlement.  Finally, the complaint alleges that Borderplex failed to provide sufficient evidence to show that it had complied with the court order that it entered into the arbitration agreement without violating the arbitration provisions of the agreement, and that it has failed to respond to the court orders by timely filing of a complaint.  As a result of the SEC's investigation, the case has been handled by the Texas Office of Compliance, which has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them investments using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Complaint\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0September\u00c2\u00a01,\u00c2\u00a02014\u00c2\u00a0that\u00c2\u00a0investors should\u00c2\u00a0check the background\u00c2\u00a0of\u00c2\u00a0people selling investments by\u00c2\u00a0using\u00c2\u00a0the\u00c2"
