  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama today entered a final judgment against Mississippi resident Manuel Ali Towns, Jr., who was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on March 14, 2017.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Birmingham, Ala., alleges that, in March 2017, Towns was convicted of two felony counts of robbery, one of which resulted in his imprisonment without parole, and one of his prior felony convictions for second-degree kidnapping.  According to the complaint, Towns agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 13b-5 thereunder, and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Towns.  On March 16, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Towns, charging him with violations of the federal securities laws, and ordering him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Towns consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 12(b)(5) and 13(c)(3) and provides that the court will determine the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.   The court's order also prohibits Towns from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, electronic or otherwise, without prior authorization from the SEC, including the issuance of a copy of the final judgment, which is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 13A-5-9(a)(3).  The Court also issued a temporary restraining order, freezing Towns's assets, and imposing a civil penalty of $2,500.  It also issued an order appointing a receiver to monitor and record any suspicious activity in the vicinity of the alleged crime scene.  Among other things, the court ordered Towns to surrender his passport, which he had obtained while on the run from the FBI, to be repatriated to his family, and that he would pay an officer and director bar of a private company.  As a result, Towns's sentence of 15 years without parole was significantly increased from his previous sentence of life imprisonment with the option to be suspended for a period of 10 years or less than 1 year and 1 day in prison.  Additionally, the Court issued an emergency asset freeze and issued an officer-and-director bar"
