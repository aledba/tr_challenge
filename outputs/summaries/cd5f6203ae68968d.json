  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Montana today entered a final judgment against Kaleb Edward Daniels, Jr., a convicted felon who was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in a December 2016 double-murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Montana, alleges that Daniels violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Daniels has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of five years, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Daniels has consented to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Daniels.  On December 29, 2016, Daniels pleaded guilty to one count of tampering with evidence in a criminal case.  According to the SEC\u2019s complaint, the jury found Daniels guilty of one of those counts on the basis of insufficient evidence, and ordered him to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2) of Securities Act of 1933.  Judge Paul G. Hannan granted Daniels\u2019 request for a temporary restraining order, ordered Daniels to surrender his passport, and barred him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Hannan also agreed to be barred from appearing and practicing before a federal district court as a trial attorney. The SEC also ordered Hannan to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation of the matter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Montana State Attorney General's Office, and the Montana Department of Criminal Justice."
