  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with evading arrest or detention with a vehicle.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Corsicana, Texas, alleges that, on October 2, 2006, defendant Harry \"Shawn\" Nicholson Jr. attempted to evade arrest and detention by driving his pickup truck through a space between a gas station parking lot and an officer's patrol unit. According to the complaint, Nicholson attempted to flee the scene in his truck, but was intercepted by the officer who was trying to arrest him. The complaint further alleges that Nicholson failed to tell the officer that he was being arrested and failed to present a valid Texas driver's license upon request. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Nicholson.  In its complaint, the SEC alleged that Nicholson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC also alleged that, in violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act, Nicholson engaged in a pattern of reckless conduct in which he engaged in aggressive and aggressive conduct that resulted in the imposition of a civil injunctive action against Nicholson, and that he aided and abetted the officer's and officer's violations.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Nicholson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Texas v. State, No. 13-05-00648-CR, 2013 WL 427135, at *3, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 1007, 2013, no pet).  In a related matter, the Court of Criminal Appeals today issued a temporary restraining order against Nicholson and ordered him to surrender his passport.  On October 4, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction against future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The court also ordered the SEC to conduct a parallel criminal investigation, which is being conducted by Michael Brooks of the San Antonio Regional Office. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Kelly."
