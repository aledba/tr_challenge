  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against an Oklahoma man accused of attempting to manufacture methamphetamine.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, alleges that Jared Faulkner failed to object to a federal court finding that he had a prior felony conviction for attempting to sell a controlled substance.  According to the complaint, the court found that Mr. Faulkner violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he was liable for a civil penalty of $100,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Mr. Welshhans has agreed to settle the case by agreeing to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 5, and orders him to pay a civil penalties of $150,000 and a $75,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has issued an\u00c2\u00a0order\u00c2\u00a0to determine whether to impose a permanent injunction against future violations.   The court also issued an order requiring the SEC to conduct an independent examination of the nature of the alleged violations of Sections 5 and 5. The court's order also requires the FBI to conduct a background check on potential violators of the charged provisions.  On May 9, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of Oklahoma, alleging that Faulkenner violated Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the securities laws.  It also charged him with aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit an unregistered offering and sale of controlled substance in violation of Section 4B1.2(b).  The complaint also alleges that, in a separate administrative proceeding, the defendant failed to disclose to a jury that his prior conviction for attempted manufacture of methamphetamine constituted a \"controlled substance offense\" and that the jury found him liable under Section 5 for that conduct.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13-cv-11, Litigation Bulletin No. 1284, Lit. 1320 (Aug. 31, 2013).  In addition, the complaint alleges that the court improperly held that defendants with prior felony convictions could be subject to the same civil penalties as those imposed by the federal government under the same federal statutes, including the mandatory jury instructions and the OCCA's construction of a \"perpetrating act\" under Oklahoma law.
