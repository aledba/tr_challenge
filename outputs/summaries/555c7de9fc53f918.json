  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee today entered a final judgment in favor of a Tennessee-based trucking company and its owner in an arbitration case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chattanooga, Tennessee, alleges that, from at least 2013 through at least 2018, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, defendants agreed to arbitration in violation of the federal securities laws, and to pay the full fees and expenses of the arbitrator as well as the portion of the arbitration filing fee that exceeds the filing fee.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to enforce the arbitration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of their contracts, and that, as a result of their violations of those provisions, they were not subject to mandatory arbitration.

To learn more about arbitration, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17 (2014).  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Civil Rights today announced that it has issued an order appointing an independent arbitrator to determine whether to issue an order imposing an injunction against violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the Federal Arbitration Rules.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office, and the case was supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the"
