  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against two men who were convicted of engaging in a sex trafficking ring.  According to the SEC's complaint, Ivan Duane Williams and Dennis Ray Davis Jr. violated the antifraud provisions of Section 1591(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 1594(c) thereunder.  The complaint alleges that the district court improperly used its discretion in improperly calculating the amount of restitution due to the three minor victims because the defendants engaged in multiple acts of prohibited sexual conduct with the minor victims.  As alleged, the defendants were the masterminds of the ring, and Hamilton and Canterbury worked at their behest.  In its judgment, the court found that Williams and Davis violated the federal securities laws by failing to properly calculate the restitution based on reasonable evidence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Williams, Davis, and their co-conspirator, Rebecca Hamilton, were each sentenced to 312 months in prison and ordered to pay $119,300 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Hamilton, Davis and Hamilton were also ordered to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the securities laws, and orders them to pay civil penalties of up to $250,000.  Davis and Davis have consented to be permanently enjoined from violating the securities law, and to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any SEC-registered broker-dealer.  Williams has also agreed to be prohibited from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock in a public company.  He also has agreed to pay a $150,000 civil penalty.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Boston Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Northern District of California, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
