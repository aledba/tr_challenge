  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Ohio today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing criminal case against John Kafantaris.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Cleveland, Ohio, alleges that, on August 31, 2016, Kafantis was indicted on one count of rape in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint further alleges that Kafataris was falsely told by a co-defendant that he did not remember details of the alleged rape and that he was using a tampon. According to the complaint, however, this was false and misleading. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze, and the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced parallel criminal charges against Kafandaris. The SEC also announced related charges against a third defendant for his role in a preindictment delay case in which the defendant was questioned, arrested, or otherwise apprehended as part of the initial investigation. The defendants agreed to settle the charges against them without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The Court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, which requires the defendants to provide an explanation of why they should not proceed with the case. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Division of Criminal Justice."
