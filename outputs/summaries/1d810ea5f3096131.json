  "summary": "On August 30, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against a California-based company and its three co-defendants in a workers' compensation case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, Robert Kalestian, Tanya Vounov, and Latasha Buie violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 4903.05 of the Exchange Act, Chorn violated the right to a timely filing of a lien with the Commission on Health and Safety and Workers' Compensation.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, require them to pay a $150 filing fee, and impose a $100 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the California Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against Chorn, charging him with violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and ordering him to pay $150,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the California Office of Financial Regulation."
