  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Roger S., a 12-year-old son of a Los Angeles County, California, mother of two who was previously incarcerated for drug-related charges.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Roger S. was living with his mother, who was incarcerated for a felony drug possession charge. According to the complaint, Roger told the social worker that his mother was \"disrespectful\" in her home and did not want him to have access to her home. Roger also allegedly complained that his father did not clean his clothes and that his clothes were dirty and too small for the child. The complaint further alleges Roger complained about having to wash his clothes every day because Mother did not wash them.  Roger also complained that he was constantly found dirty with a foul odor of urine and sweat, and that he did not like to go to class because he was \"boring.\"  The complaint charges Roger with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Child and Family Education today announced that it has issued an order suspending Roger from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or promotion of any substance, including, without limitation, possession of a controlled substance, with the right to reapply after five years of incarceration.  On May 8, 2018, the SEC filed a dependency petition under Section 300 of the Exchange Act, alleging that Roger was at substantial risk of suffering serious physical harm or illness as a result of Mother\u2019s neglectful conduct. The SEC also issued a temporary restraining order against Roger, ordering him to return to his home, and imposing a $1,000 civil penalty against him.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Roger consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $2,500 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about child and family law violations, see the Child Abuse Task Force's website."
