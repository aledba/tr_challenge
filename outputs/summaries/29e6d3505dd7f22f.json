  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against the defendants in a medical malpractice case brought by Anne and James Cobbin, a mother and daughter who were hospital staff members.  The court also entered a judgment against a Cleveland Clinic employee who was not named as a defendant in the complaint.  According to the court's order, the defendants failed to adequately diagnose and treat Anne's fractured leg and failed to order an X-ray that would have shown her had a broken leg.  In addition, the court found that the defendants violated the standard of care required of the hospital and its registered nurses.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the doctors, nurses, and patient assistants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains the defendants' liability for the hospital's negligent conduct.  On August 2, 2018, the Ohio Court of Appeals granted the Cobbins' motion for summary judgment, which requires the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.   The SEC's order also requires the hospital to pay a $1,000 civil penalty, and requires the nurses to provide an accounting of their compensation.  For example, the SEC's complaint alleges that Anne was dropped by a patient assistant and that Dr. Ho \"noted [Anne's] fall,\" but discharged Anne the next day without ordering an Xray or any other treatment. The complaint also alleges that the nurses failed to inform the attending physician that Anne had suffered a closed nondisplaced fracture of her right tibia and fibula.  Finally, the complaint alleges in its complaint that the Cleveland Clinic staff failed to detect or otherwise recognize that Mrs. Cobbin was suffering from a fractured leg sustained while in the custody and care of the Clinic, and that the hospital was liable for the patient's injury. The SEC also alleges in a civil action against the hospital that, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, the hospital could be vicariously liable for liability if it found the nurses liable for a breach of that standard.  Additionally, the case was handled by John R. Shields, who was a member of the trial court's staff.
