  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Lissette Rivera, a former kitchen aide at a New York City public school, for her role in a Social Security Administration denial of her benefits.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 12, 2017, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, Rivera was injured in January 2014 while cleaning tables one day while learning to move furniture.  The complaint alleges that Rivera was unable to do basic work, such as picking up garbage or taking garbage out of the canisters, and that the complaint was filed in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") Rules 10b-5, 13b2-1, and 13a-14 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Rivera consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC issued a temporary restraining order against Rivera from violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) and Rule 206(3)-4 thereunder, and ordered her to comply with the court's order.
