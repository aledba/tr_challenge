  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi yesterday entered a final judgment ordering that the estate of Carolyn Bowen Young be held in the registry of the court.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Carolyn was incapable of managing her own estate and reasonably caring for herself by reason of advanced age, physical incapacity, and/or mental weakness.  According to the complaint, Carolyn began having various medical problems from 2011 to 2014 and asked that a conservator of her estate be appointed over her estate. The court granted Carolyn's request for the conservator's appointment on June 23, 2016, and ordered that all of Carolyn's funds be released to her. The complaint also alleged that Carolyn's sons, John Kennedy, Joseph Kennedy, and Jimmy Kennedy, failed to establish the inability to pay for Carolyn's attorney's fees and instead filed a petition with the court for her to be appointed as conservatorship.  In a judgment issued yesterday, the court granted the sons' requests for a temporary restraining order, ordered Carolyn to pay attorneys' fees in the amount of $4,505.12, and directed Carolyn to deposit $1,285.03 into an account for the benefit of the estate.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, Carolyn has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The judgment also prohibits Carolyn from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer of any real estate and from participating in any offering or sale of a real estate. In addition, the order requires Carolyn to submit a statement of reasonable fees to be paid out of the funds held in her registry.  Carolyn has agreed to the issuance of a court order that requires her to pay $3,520.00 in attorney fees, which will be distributed to her sons as part of the restitution ordered by the court in the Complaint. The order also provides for Carolyn to have access to the records of any person or entity with whom she wishes to sell her real estate for a total of $580,000.  On May 15, 2017, Carolyn was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and requested that her husband, Jim, and another attorney, Bill Benson, be appointed to serve as her agent. The judge agreed to this request. The next day, Carolyn became severely ill and was again hospitalized for a lengthy period of time. The sons filed a motion for the release of funds, which the court denied. Carolyn's husband, John, Joseph, and Jim Young each signed the final judgment that permanently enjoins Carolyn from violating"
