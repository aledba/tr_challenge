  "summary": "On October 6, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio entered a final judgment against defendant Bryan Mitchell Dotson, who was sentenced to 60 months in prison for his role in a 2014 car theft.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Ohio, from March 2014 through March 2014, Dotson and two other men attempted to steal vehicles from Johnny K's Powersports in Niles, Ohio.  The complaint alleges that, on March 12, 2014, the defendants entered into an agreement to merge all seven counts of Grand Theft of a Motor Vehicle and Break and Entering with one another.  As alleged in the complaint, the three men entered the Pace Building and entered the building through the back door, leaving the vehicles behind.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Attorney General's Office today announced that it filed criminal charges against Dotson.  On August 17, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Brown, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Brown consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and requires him to provide a copy of the complaint to the court.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Ohio Department of Justice in this matter."
