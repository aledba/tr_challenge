  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against a Pennsylvania corporation for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on April 14, 1995, the Baruch College Colony of Pi Delta Psi, Inc., a national, Asian-interest-based fraternal organization, took its associate members to Pennsylvania for the final stages of a program for would-be brothers. The complaint alleges that the trial court improperly excluded two exhibits from evidence.  The complaint further alleges that, in denying the corporation's request to be barred from participating in the program, the court imposed a probationary condition on the corporation.  In a parallel action, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against the corporation for its role in the hazing death of an associate member.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the corporation consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws, orders it to pay a civil penalty of $112,500, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar. The judgment also prohibits the corporation from conducting any business within the Commonwealth for a decade, and orders the corporation to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties of $10,000 and $20,000, respectively. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Philadelphia Regional Office, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Market Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and was supervised by Amy C. Welshhans and Glenn S. Gordon in the Philadelphia office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Pennsylvania Department of Justice in this matter."
