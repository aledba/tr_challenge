  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered final judgments against C.R. England, Inc., a trucking company based in Leigh, Utah, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Utah, alleges that, in violation of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, England was not liable for intentionally interfering with contracts. Rather, the complaint alleges that he was liable for failing to show that he or she had interfered with an existing contract. The complaint further alleges that the court in Leigh found that, contrary to the federal law, the defendant could not be held liable for intentional interference with contracts because there was no clear, controlling Utah law regarding what constitutes improper means. The court in St. Benedict\u2019s also found that the defendant had violated a three-part test for the tort of intentional interference, which requires a defendant to show cause and effect of an action that is contrary to law, such as violations of statutes, regulations, or recognized common-law rules, and that England had violated that test in Leigh.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, England consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his or her ill-gotten gains.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Utah today announced criminal charges against England. The SEC also announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against England, charging her with violations of the anti-fraud provision of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (\"Bureau of Investigation\") Rules of Practice and Rules of Criminal Procedure.   The court also issued a temporary restraining order against England and ordered her to comply with the SEC's requests for an accounting of her conduct, including her receipt of a $1,000,000 civil penalty, as well as an officer-and-director bar against her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any such order. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Salt Lake Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Graham L. Gibson and Mr. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry."
