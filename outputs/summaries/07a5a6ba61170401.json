  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona today held that Arizona law requires law enforcement officers to obtain a blood or breath sample from a person arrested for driving under the influence (\u201cDUI\u201d) only if the arrestee expressly agrees to the test.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Phoenix, Arizona, on April 2, 2016, Alexis Diaz was arrested and later charged with DUI. The complaint alleges that Diaz agreed to a warrantless breath test that revealed an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or above, which was deemed reasonable under the federal implied consent statute. The court found that Diaz violated the antifraud provisions of Section 28-1321 of the federal securities laws, and ordered her to submit to the breath test. Diaz agreed and submitted to a breath test, which revealed an impairment level 0.09 or above. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Diaz consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently suspended her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or promotion of any federal or state law requiring an arrestee to consent to warrantless testing. The final judgment permanently enjoins Diaz from violating the federal, state, and local registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Arizona Office of Criminal Investigations and supervised by Marc Blau. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Arizona Department of Motor Vehicles, and the Arizona State Office of Health and Human Services in this matter."
