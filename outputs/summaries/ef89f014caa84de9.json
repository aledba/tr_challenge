  "summary": "On March 27, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against the SEC against the Commissioner of Social Security's denial of her applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that the SEC violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the SEC failed to properly consider the reports of headaches in Lustgarten\u2019s medical records when making its determination regarding her eligibility for the benefits.  For example, the complaint alleges that, in her initial Disability Report filed in the SEC in May 2014, Dr. Dekle, M.D., recommended that Lustgarden keep her feet elevated for most of the day, every day, even if she had to rest, recline, or lie down at unpredictable intervals during an eight-hour workday.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's judgment, the Commission agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the SEC from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders the SEC to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Lustgat.  On March 28, 2018, the Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to determine whether to proceed with the application of the proposed asset freeze.  To learn more about the Administrative Procedure Act, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221 (March 27, 2016).  The Commission's order also prohibits the issuance of any civil injunctions or orders prohibiting the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security or disability benefit for at least six months, and requires the Commission to consider all relevant evidence, including medical opinion evidence, before making a determination about whether or how much weight to assign to a person's disability determination. The Commission also has the discretion not to revoke or suspend the appointment of a receiver, as well as any officer or director of a public company. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
