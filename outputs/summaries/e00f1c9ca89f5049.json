  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a Bryan City School District employee who was terminated for whistleblowing about a computer purchase.  According to the court's order, on July 10, 2014, Rob Rosswurm purchased a computer for his daughter through the school and told her that he would reimburse the school for the purchase. The court found that Hageman failed to establish that the computer purchase constituted a criminal offense and that she had reported the purchase to the school auditor's office, indicating that sales tax was not paid on the purchase and that the school had not reimbursed the school.  The court also found that the purchase was not a violation of the federal securities laws, and that, as a result of Hageman's whistleblowing activity, she was not entitled to protection under R.C. 124.341.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hageman consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from future violations of the whistleblower protection provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. Hageman also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years.  In a parallel action, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued an order suspending Hageman from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Franklin County, Ohio, charges Hageman with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) and of the reporting requirements of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, officer-and-director bars, and penny stock bars against Hageman, and a conduct-based injunction against her from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future. The investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Public Finance Abuse Unit and supervised by Kurt L. Gottschall of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The examination that led to the finding of the SEC's finding was conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Enforcement's Fraud Section."
