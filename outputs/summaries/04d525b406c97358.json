The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that, from at least April 2017 through at least June 2018, Father was placed in the care of his foster mother, who was an indicated perpetrator of child abuse. According to the complaint, the court found that Father violated Section 2511(a)(2) and (3) and ordered him to relinquish his parental rights to the children.
