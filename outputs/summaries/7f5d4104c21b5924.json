  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Maralex Resources, Inc. (\"Maralex\") in an administrative proceeding related to a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint alleges that the BLM violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its order, the court also entered an order requiring the BLM to conduct warrantless, unannounced inspections of oil and gas wells on public lands subject to a communitization agreement.  According to the SEC's order, on February 11, 2013, Gabriel Trujillo contacted the BLM and told it that he had \"no rights to be on his land\" to inspect the wells, because the surface and minerals were owned by him.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the BLM consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the BLM from violating these provisions and orders it to place its own locks on the wells.  On July 10, 2015, the IBLA issued four Notices of Incidents of Noncompliance (INCs) to the BLM for refusing to permit inspection of the wells on federal or Indian lands.  As alleged, the order also requires the BLM provide the landowner with key to the locked gates so that the agent can access the wells without a search warrant or search warrant.   The court also granted the BLM's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by John Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
