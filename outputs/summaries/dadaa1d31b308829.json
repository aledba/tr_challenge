  "summary": "On September 26, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a temporary restraining order against a Shasta Lake City Council member accused of preparing false statements in a petition to recall her from office.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Sacramento, California on Sept. 26, 2011, defendant Kay Kobe, a resident of Redding, California, and a member of the city council committee seeking the recall of defendant John S. Lucero, was among those who signed the petition.  The complaint alleges that, in November 2011, when Lucero approached her house and asked her to sign the petition, she did not know that there were no other people with her.  As alleged in the complaint, the petition was not for Lucero's recall and was being circulated by a person who had been with Lucero during the recall effort.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty and a $20,000 officer-director penalty.  On October 2, 2011 the court granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the anti-fraud provisions, ordered a conduct-based injunction, and issued an order suspending the registration of any person or entity with intent to commit a felony in connection with the alleged violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(A) and (c).  The order also prohibits the defendant from participating in the issuance, purchase, sale, or promotion of any type of written document, including"
