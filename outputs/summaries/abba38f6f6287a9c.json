  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered final judgments against a defendant in a child custody proceeding against her.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in San Diego, California, alleges that on May 21, 2015, Mexican authorities failed to timely respond to the court's e-mails to inform them that the court had jurisdiction over the children's cases.  According to the complaint, the Mexican authorities' failure to respond was tantamount to their declination of jurisdiction.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Mother for her role in an April 2015 arrest in San Luis Obispo, California.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Mother was arrested in Mexico on a felony warrant arising out of the April 2015 charges against her and her two children, A.C. and E.C., and was later sentenced to prison terms of 10 years and 10 months.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Mother consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against her from serving as an officer or director of a public company. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Ms. Bort. \u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mexican Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, and the Mexican Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
