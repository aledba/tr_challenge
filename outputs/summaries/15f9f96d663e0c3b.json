  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California today entered a final judgment against the San Francisco Police Officers Association, a recognized employee organization, for failing to meet and confer with the City of San Francisco regarding the implementation of a new use of force policy.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in San Francisco, California, alleges that San Francisco violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  The complaint further alleges that the Commission failed to meet or confer with San Francisco about certain of the issues raised in the Commission's complaint.  According to the complaint, the Commission violated Section 3505 of the federal securities laws, and that it had no duty to negotiate in good faith with the Commission regarding the impact of the new policy on police officers' conditions of employment.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, San Francisco consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws and ordering it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced parallel criminal charges against San Francisco.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) entered a temporary restraining order and order prohibiting the City from imposing any monetary penalty on San Francisco residents who had not agreed to arbitrate the matter.  Sansone agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay $1,078.95, which is a penalty that is subject to the court's approval.  San Francisco agreed to a settlement where it agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating these provisions, to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public agency, and to pay civil penalties of up to $10,000. The settlement is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by San Francisco Regional Office staff.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the California Office of Inspector General, the Federal Office of Investigations, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
