  "summary": "On May 2, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Straits Financial, Inc. (\"Straits\") and Ten Sleep Cattle Co. (\"Ten Sleep\").  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, from 2010 through 2012, Ten Sleep and Carter violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The complaint alleges that, in 2010, through a broker in Scottsbluff, Nebraska, Carter opened a futures and options trading account with a Chicago-based financial institution. The complaint further alleges that the account was intended to secure the prices Ten Sleep would receive for its cattle in the year, and that Carter failed to adequately account for the losses in the account.  As alleged in the complaint, however, the SEC found that Carter violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Ten Sleep.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Chicago Regional Office by John R. Rymas of the Market Abuse Unit, and the case is being supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Illinois Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Illinois Secretary of State's Office and the Illinois Commodities Futures Trading Commission."
