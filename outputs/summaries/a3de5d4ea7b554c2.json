  "summary": "On June 8, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Harrison Edmond Hogan, Jr., a former Community Team Manager at Midcity Gardens on North Boulevard, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Hogan, who was previously employed by Latter and Blum Property Management, pursuant to the Protection for Victims of Sexual Assault Act of 1940.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New Orleans, Hogan was terminated by her mutual employer on March 15, 2017. The complaint alleges that he was an uninvited presence at her workplace on multiple occasions, including on at least one occasion, when she became concerned that Defendant blamed her for his termination because she had raised some issues with her supervisor regarding Defendant's behavior and actions while on the job. The SEC alleges that Hogan was escorted off the premises by a BRPD officer and instructed not to return, i.e., banned from the property. The court subsequently amended the trial court minute entry for the hearing to reflect a different time that the court hearings began raising reasonable suspicion enough to warrant a finding that sexual assault occurred. In addition, the court instructed court personnel to call for Defendant out in the hall; however, no one responded.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Hogan.  On June 24, 2017 in federal court in Baton Rouge, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, charging Hogan with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Securities Act of 1933, and Section 13(b)(2)(A) of Exchange Act Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-11 thereunder, and charging him with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Program, and with aiding and abetting violations of Section 15(a) and 16(c) of Advisers Advisers, Rule 15a-14, and Rule 15b-1 thereunder of the Exchange Act.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hogan consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
