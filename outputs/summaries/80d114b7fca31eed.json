  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Texas Inpatient Consultants, LLLP, a hospitalist partnership that provides medical services to hospitalized patients of other physicians.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, in May 2014, Julius Tabe, M.D., a resident of Houston, Texas, agreed to be employed by Texas inpatient as a consultant physician and to provide medical services for patients at hospitals that had contracts with the partnership.  According to the complaint, Tabe was not credentialed and approved to work at the hospitals, and that he withdrew his candidacy for the hospitalist position shortly before he gave notice of his intention to withdraw.  As alleged, the settlement is subject to court approval.  In its complaint, filed in federal court in Texas, the SEC alleges that Tabe violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Tabe.  On August 11, 2014, a Texas judge granted summary judgment in favor of the partnership, ordering Tabe to pay $34,000 in liquidated damages and a $58,775 attorney's fee.  Tabe agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rule 206(3) and (4)-8 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $55,000.  A hearing on September 13, 2016, was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-0117 (Aug. 30, 2016).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the San Antonio Regional Office.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Fort Worth Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Texas Secretary of State's Office."
