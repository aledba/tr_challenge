  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against a Utah man who was convicted of lewdness, sodomy, and other gross violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that the Utah Attorney General's Office improperly entered jury instructions for the lewdness and other violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  According to the complaint, the SEC's order, which was entered without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, improperly included the Catchall Variant in jury instructions.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in violation of the above-mentioned provisions of the federal law, Thomas was liable for a civil injunctive action and a conduct-based injunction, for which he was ordered to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, for a total of $160,000.    The complaint further alleges that Thomas was not entitled to a fair and impartial jury because he was not a member of the jury.  As a result, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins Thomas from future violations of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) of The Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay $75,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil monetary penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment penalties.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Paul G. Walker of the Salt Lake Regional Office issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order against Thomas, ordering him to surrender his passport, and requiring him to provide a copy of the complaint to the court. The order also prohibits Thomas from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock. The court also ordered Thomas to comply with the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating Section 5(b).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Utah today announced criminal charges against Thomas arising from the same conduct alleged in the complaint against him.
