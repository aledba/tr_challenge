  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a final judgment against defendant Leo Phillips, finding him guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that Phillips failed to properly preserve his right to a fair trial.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Denver, Phillips agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to comply with the court's orders.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Phillips arising out of the same conduct that led to his conviction.  As alleged in the complaint, Phillips also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any firearm, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint.  On the same day, the court granted Phillips's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to surrender his gun, which he allegedly concealed from the court.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of the Chief Trial Counsel and the Division of Criminal Investigations, with the assistance of trial counsel. The litigation will be led by John Rymas and supervised by Amy Gwiazda. The case is being supervised by Lara S. Mehraban. The SEC thanks the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for its assistance in this matter.The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC encourages investors to check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In addition, the SEC is seeking an asset freeze and other emergency relief.  Investors can also use the SEC\u00c2\u00a0instant funds to purchase or lease a home.  For example, in a recent case, a federal judge found that a defendant with a felony conviction for possession of a firearm had the right to refuse a court order requiring him to relinquish the gun.  A jury trial is scheduled for May 26, 2019.  To learn more about this, see Litigation Release No. 539 (Aug. 24, 2014)."
