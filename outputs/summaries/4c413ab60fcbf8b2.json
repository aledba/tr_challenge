  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia yesterday entered a final judgment against RCO Legal, P.S., Inc., a Washington-based law firm that provides mortgage default services, and its vice president for the southeast region, Larry W. Johnson.  The SEC's complaint alleges that RCO hired Johnson as the vice president in 2013 and he was to co-manage RCO's southeast region client files with Joel A. Freedman, Joel Freedman's then-law partner. The complaint also alleges that Johnson misappropriated $76,602.89 in excess funds from a foreclosure sale on property belonging to Luther Carl Murray. According to the complaint, Johnson allegedly misused the excess funds for personal expenses and to make payments to a private investigator. The SEC alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that Johnson violated the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rules 206(3) and 206 (4) thereunder. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, RCO agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the reporting provision of the Exchange Act, and orders it to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC also issued a temporary restraining order against Johnson, barring him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney-client, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the Atlanta Regional Office issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee RCO\u2019s litigation against Johnson. The receiver will determine the amount of the civil penalty and will determine whether to issue an officer-and-director bar.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-17 (2014).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted in the Atlanta office by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Jan S. Gottschall and Eric R. Werner. The case was supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Georgia Office of Compliance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Georgia Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
