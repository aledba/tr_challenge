  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania today entered a final judgment against EQT, a Pennsylvania-based company that sought to construct, operate, and maintain a natural gas production complex in Jefferson Hills, Pennsylvania.  According to the court's order, EQT and its subsidiary, ET Blue Grass Clearing LLC, sought conditional use approval for the construction and operation of an unconventional oil and gas well site on a private property within the Borough of Jefferson Hills.  The court found that EQT's conditional use application did not meet its burden of proof because, as alleged, it was based upon the testimony of residents who lived near the well site.  In addition, the court also found that, in addition to providing reasonable assurances about the safety and health of the residents of the borough, the company also failed to adequately consider the impact of the drilling activities on the surrounding communities.  EQT has agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a $50,000 civil penalty.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The court also granted the SEC's request for an asset freeze, a temporary restraining order, and an officer-and-director bar.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 569 A.3d (2017).  The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to quickly check the backgrounds of people selling investments."
