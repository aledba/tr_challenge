  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle East today entered a default judgment against Iran in a case brought by the United States Department of Justice.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that, from January 2012 through January 2016, Iranian authorities held American citizen Behnaz Hekmati captive and held him in a prison cell for nearly five years.  According to the complaint, as a result of the alleged torture, Heekmati was forced to live in a \"suite\" in which he was shackled to a wall for hours at a time, and subjected to \"torture\" and \"permanent physical and mental pain and suffering.\"  The complaint also alleges that he was repeatedly threatened with death by his captors, who repeatedly beat and kicked him in the face and body.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the prison officials repeatedly threatened to \"beat\" or \"tape\" Hekmai and his family members in order to induce him to cooperate with the authorities.  Finally, the SEC alleges that one of the prison officers threatened to cut off his phone and internet access to prevent him from using it, and another officer threatened to blow up his car.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay $26.02 million in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and to pay a civil penalty of $5,728,179, which is equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest and a penalty to be determined by the court at a later date.   The court also granted a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against the defendant, ordering him to return to his home country of Iran, and imposing a $1,000,000 civil penalty against the other defendant. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael P. Thompson and supervised by Marc Blau of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Graham Loomis and Ms. Thompson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United Kingdom Attorney General's Office, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
