  "summary": "On March 2, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against GAA Classic Cars, LLC (GAA), a North Carolina-based car-related company, for defrauding a nonresident investor in an online auction.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, alleges that GAA sent fraudulent advertisements, emails, and phone calls to Illinois residents in connection with the sale of a 1973 Ford Bronco for sale at auction. The complaint alleges that the Bronco's owner had cut electrical wires and replaced them with new brakes, and GAA's website contained numerous false statements about the condition of the engine.  According to the complaint, GAA told Dixon he could participate in the auction by using his computer in his Illinois home and by using a website to reach Illinois residents.  GAA also allegedly sent Dixon a signed registration form, which contained a link to a website that contained information about the engine and the cause of action.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against the company.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest thereon, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On March 13, 2019, the court issued a temporary restraining order and ordered GAA to pay a $37,000 civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000 and a $1 million civil penalty, respectively. The court also issued an order suspending GAA from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  A hearing on the matter is scheduled for May 24, 2019.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, 2018."
