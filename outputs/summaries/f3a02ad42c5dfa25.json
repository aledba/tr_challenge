  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arkansas today entered a final judgment against Phillip Pace, a long-term substitute teacher for the Texarkana, Arkansas, Independent School District, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Arkansas, Phillip and his wife, Jill Pace, raised concerns about the safety and well-being of their two children while in Jill's care.  The complaint alleges that Jill and Phillip violated Section 13(b)(5) and 13(a)(3) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 and 13a-13 thereunder, and that Jill violated Section 17(a) of that order.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Jill.  Phillip and Jill have agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of the final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Section 12(e) and (f) of The Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 12a-1, and 13b-11 thereunder and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director bars.  Jill has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively, to be determined by the court at a later date.  On June 25, the court convened a final hearing on Phillip's motion to modify the custody arrangement, which was approved by the SEC on July 16, 2015.  As part of the settlement, Phillip agreed to pay $150,000 in attorney's fees and a $75,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Phillip has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the Exchange Act, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $250,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Elizabeth Foster, John Rymas, and Eric Werner of the SEC Enforcement Division's Fort Worth Regional Office, with assistance from Scott Frost, and is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Ms. Foster, Ms. Werner, and Mr. Werner."
