  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a temporary restraining order and asset freeze against Leland Smith, a repeat Chapter 13 bankruptcy filer.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that Smith violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he violated Section 362(c)(3)(A) as to actions against property of the bankruptcy estate.  According to the complaint, Smith also violated Section 5 of the Bankruptcy Code, which requires the court to determine whether a debtor or a creditor is entitled to a stay of a certain amount of time.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, in violation of Section 5, Smith failed to show sufficient cooperation with the court in order to terminate the automatic stay.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaints, Smith consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of\u00c2\u00a0the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"), and orders him to pay disgorgement of $51,596.53, prejudgment interest of $1,038, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Smith also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty in the amount of $50,000, which is equal to the amount owed to him by the company in the bankruptcy proceeding.   The settlement is subject to court approval.

Office of Financial Regulation today announced that it had issued an Investor Alert about the need for investors to be aware of the unusual nature of bankruptcy filings.
