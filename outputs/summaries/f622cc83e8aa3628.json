  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana yesterday entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of two felony counts of premeditated murder and a felony conspiracy to commit armed robbery.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Evansville, Indiana, alleges that, on July 18, 2018, brothers Kevin and Jahkei Mitchell went to Sam's Food Market to buy cigarettes and gas. According to the complaint, Kevin, who was a high school senior at the time of the alleged crime, was one of only two Black people on the jury. The complaint further alleges that Kevin was the only one who had the gun when he and his brother confronted Denyae and confronted him about the gun. The SEC alleges that the defendant admitted to lying to his father and telling his father that he had a gun in his closet when he was a teenager, and that his father had been robbed twice when she was a child. The court also found that Denyai had a history of pre-meditated criminal activity, including a felony conviction for possession of a firearm in 2006, and had been convicted of possession of paraphernalia and criminal mischief in 2006. The Court also ruled that the defendants were not liable for pre-judgment prejudgment interest in the case.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against Kevin.  On March 21, 2019, the U. S. Attorney's office for the Northern District of Illinois announced criminal prosecutions against Kevin, and the SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01221.  An SEC order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver was issued yesterday.  A hearing on March 24, 2019 was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. EST. The jury deliberated for approximately 45 minutes before the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the receiver from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The hearing will be conducted by Timothy J. Sansone, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and Amy C. McKinley of the Chicago Regional Office, with assistance from John R. Rymas of the Division of Criminal Justice."
