  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon in possession of a gun and sentenced him to 84 months in prison.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Akron, Ohio, Jerad Tatum, a resident of Ohio, was arrested in July 2015 on a charge of possession of marijuana. The complaint alleges that the Ohio Department of Justice improperly classified Tatum as a \"prior sentence\" for a controlled-substance offense and improperly classified certain prior convictions as multiple, separate sentences in calculating his criminal history score.  The complaint further alleges that Tatum had a prior felony conviction for marijuana possession, which was deemed a prior criminal conviction under the federal securities laws, and that the court improperly classified his prior felony marijuana possession convictions as a prior sentence.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Tatum consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Tatum also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Tatum. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. McCluskey and supervised by Lara S. Mehraban. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Ohio Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Ohio Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
