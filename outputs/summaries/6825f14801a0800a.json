  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a new trial against a Lawrence man who was convicted of a felony-murder in 2009.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, on June 22, 2009, the defendant and his girlfriend, Tori Giana, were questioned by Lawrence Police Department officers in the days leading up to his arrest. According to the complaint, Giana told the officers that she believed the defendant had engaged in a \"cell phone ruse\" in which he instructed Giana to call him using a detective's cellular telephone. The complaint alleges that Giana replied, \"Surprised\" to hear the defendant's voice, and that, during the interrogation, he told the officer that he had heard the reading of those rights before he made his June 23rd statement to the police. Giana agreed to the officer's request for a DiGiambattista instruction, and agreed to comply with the court's order. The defendant also agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest and a civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Giana. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar. The case is being handled by Jennifer M. Kolenovic of the New York Regional Office, with assistance from Joseph G. Sansone, of the Division of Criminal Justice's Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Murnahan. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Massachusetts Department of Justice in this matter."
