  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Alabama today announced criminal charges against a Birmingham, Alabama man accused of making and distributing child pornography.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, while in custody, Larry Garrett, Jr., provided an SD card to Anthony \"Amp\" Jones, Anthony \u201cAmp\u201d Jones, and Demetrius Holmes of the Birmingham Police Department. According to the complaint, Garrett created the SD card because he was interested in depicting sex with children. The complaint further alleges that Garrett showed Jones a video of a man masturbating and putting his penis in a child's mouth. Garrett allegedly used the video to show that the man in the video was Jones, not Garrett. Garrett also allegedly told Jones that he had made a movie for Jones, but denied owning a cell phone when he was arrested. The SEC alleges that the videos were inadmissible because they were not relevant to Garrett\u2019s alleged history of child molestation or production of child pornography, and Garrett had a prior felony conviction for sexual conduct with a minor for which he was sentenced to a 600-month prison term. Garrett was subsequently indicted on the child pornography charges in September 2016, and the district court agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins Garrett from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment also prohibits Garrett from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 23, 2019, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in Birmingham against Garrett, alleging that he violated Rule 404 of the federal securities laws. Garrett agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia today entered final judgments against Garrett and Jones, ordering him to disgorge $3,500 in ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing a $1,500 civil penalty against Jones. The court also ordered Garrett to cooperate with the investigation, which is continuing. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Stephen F. Dumornay, and Ashley K. Knighten of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson."
