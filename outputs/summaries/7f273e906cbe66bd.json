  "summary": "On August 21, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a temporary restraining order against a Texas-based 3-D printing company and its related entities in an action brought by the United States Department of State.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that, since at least 2013, the federal government has taken the position that computer aided design (CAD) files should be available on the internet for the manufacture of 3-d printed guns. The complaint alleges that the federal defendants failed to consider the unique and undetectable properties of 3D printed guns when they decided to remove the CAD files from the website.  According to the complaint, the government's decision not to permit the publication of the CAD file violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants have consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws and orders them to comply with the court's order. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In its order, the court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction, which is pending final approval by the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-20 (July 31, 2018).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant the Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs, which administers the agency's Export Control Reform Initiative, as an emergency relief defendant. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Texas Department of Commerce, and the Texas Office of Inspector General in this matter."
