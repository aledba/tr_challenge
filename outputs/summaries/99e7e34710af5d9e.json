  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for failing to expedite the processing of elephant trophy applications.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that the Fish and Game Service violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the agency failed to adequately consider the risks posed by the decline in elephant trophy sales.  According to the complaint, the Service's delay in processing permit applications resulted in the loss of approximately 46% of the total cash income to conservation groups in the African continent.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, despite repeated requests for expedited processing of permit applications, the agency has not acted on those claims.  For example, the SEC alleges that in 2014 and 2015, when the Service halted the import of elephant trophies from Africa, it did so without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the complaint.  As a result of the delay, the Commission has not issued a preliminary injunction, and the complaint seeks a permanent injunction, a temporary restraining order, and an officer-and-director bar.  On March 29, 2020, the court granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunctive relief, which is subject to court approval, and ordered the agency to provide a copy of the final judgment to each of the relief parties.   The court's order also prohibits the Service from issuing or denying an emergency action, including an order appointing an emergency court to determine whether to issue an emergency asset freeze or an asset freeze, and prohibits the agency from issuing an order suspending or denying the entry of any emergency relief order.  Without admitting to the Commission's findings, the defendants consented to the issuance of the order, which permanently enjoins them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a $10,000 civil penalty.  Additionally, the order requires the Service to provide an accounting of the anticipated loss in revenue that the individual hunters will experience in the event of a loss of a trophy.  To learn more about antifreeze relief, see the Commission on Environmental Quality's (CERQ) Complaint Bulletin No. 5, No. 17(b)(2) and Rule 17a-3 thereunder. \u00c2\u00a0The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0"
