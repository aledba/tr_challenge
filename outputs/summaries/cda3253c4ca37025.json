  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a husband and wife who allegedly violated the antifraud provisions of Section 14-10-113 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 14-2-310 thereunder.  The court granted the wife and husband's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the dissolution of their marriage.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, John Zander and Denise Zander entered into a marriage in which they had orally agreed to keep their retirement accounts and inheritances as their separate property. The court found that the oral agreement was valid and enforceable because it did not meet the statutory requirements under the federal marriage laws. The complaint alleges that the wife sought to enforce the husband\u2019s oral promises that he would transfer oil and gas interests to her and contribute to her son, and that she would use marital funds during the dissolution proceeding to pay certain marital debts. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the Zander family consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from violating the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court denied the husband and his wife an emergency asset freeze and ordered him to pay civil penalties of $2,500 each. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Scott A. Thompson. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Colorado Office of Financial Regulation in this matter."
