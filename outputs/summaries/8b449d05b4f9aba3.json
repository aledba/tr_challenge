  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri today entered a final judgment against a Missouri real estate agent who was denied a probated license because he had a history of substance abuse-related criminal convictions.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Missouri on March 15, 2017, William R. Held, a registered representative under the name of Keller Williams Realty West, was falsely told that he was a person of good moral character when, in fact, Held had no criminal history.  The complaint alleges that Held had been drug-free since July 2013, and had participated in a series of different substance abuse treatment programs, including an intensive after-care program that included regular drug testing.  Held also told the SEC that he had taken numerous, sustained, affirmative steps to overcome his substance abuse problems, including participating and being a facilitator in various drug treatment programs.  In addition, Held allegedly told the Commission that he viewed his recovery from substance abuse as an ongoing process requiring ongoing participation in substance abuse prevention programs, and that the AHC had the discretion to issue Held a \"probated\" license despite Held\u2019s significant history of drug possession and trafficking offenses; stealing; receiving stolen property; unlawful possession of a weapon; and resisting arrest.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Held consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Held to pay a civil penalty of three years\u2019 imprisonment.  Holding also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be prohibited from participating in any substance-abuse treatment program.   The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Held. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Missouri Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Missouri Office of Financial Regulation."
