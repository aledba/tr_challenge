  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment in favor of a teacher who was laid off in violation of the federal education law.  The SEC's complaint, filed on June 2, 2015, alleges that, in 2011, Paula Lightsey, the principal of Thompson K-8 Academy, was the only teacher in the school district to receive a \"minimally effective\" performance evaluation from a school district. According to the complaint, Lightsey was not given the opportunity to improve her performance, and she was subsequently hired to teach summer school during the 2011-2012 school year. The complaint further alleges that Lightsey told another teacher that she \"would not have to worry about [plaintiff] if she had sufficient opportunities to improve.\" The complaint also alleges that defendants failed to provide any information regarding the results of an investigation that followed plaintiff\u2019s complaint. In addition, the complaint alleges that during the course of her layoff, lightsey allegedly observed her performance in the classroom but did not provide her with any opportunity to cure any purported deficiencies. The SEC alleges that lightsey had no basis to believe that a poor evaluation of plaintiff would result in her being laid off, and that she was not provided with an opportunity to remediate her performance. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Lightsey.  In its continuing investigation, the SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to\u00c2\u00a0check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by David Turner and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Summer and Ms. McGlynn. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Michigan Department of Education in this matter.
