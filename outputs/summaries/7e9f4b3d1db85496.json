  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon for orchestrating a double murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Hyannis, Massachusetts, alleges that Christopher Manoloules, who was the son of a family matriarch who had had three children, committed the double murder on September 29, 2009.  According to the complaint, Christopher was the only defendant in the family who had ever been convicted of a felony for committing such a crime.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that, on the night of the murder, Christopher stole a Ruger and ammunition from his father's car and then shot the victim in the back of the head.  Christopher also allegedly told a friend that he had heard Treefon offer to pay the victim to kill the victim.  In addition, Christopher allegedly told the friend that the defendant had hidden the gun in her basement days after the defendant's interrogation and believed the gun had hidden it there after she demanded that he remove it from her home.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Christopher consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $165,000.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the sale or purchase of any security, other than for his own personal use.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Robert L. Gibson of the United States District Court in New York granted the motion for a new trial and ordered Christopher to cooperate with the investigation and the prosecution in a parallel criminal case.  Judge Gibson also granted the request for a temporary restraining order against Christopher, ordering Christopher to surrender his passport, and ordering him to provide an accounting of the amount of his ill-gotten gains with respect to his mother and sister.  Finally, Judge Gibson issued a judgment permanently enjoining Christopher from violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, ordering the defendant to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to those of the defendant and the judge in the criminal case against him.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2019 is scheduled for 11:30 a.m."
