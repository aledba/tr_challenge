  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced today that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing criminal case against Joseph Watkins.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, from at least 2013 through at least 2015, Judge William Blackstone of the Atlanta Regional Office improperly obtained access to court records in violation of the common law right of access.  According to the complaint, the court found that the court reporter\u2019s audio recordings were not part of the court record, and therefore could not be made available for public inspection.  In addition, the complaint alleges that a court reporter had the right to make copies of court proceedings, even though the court had no right to do so.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Judge Blackstone consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and a temporary asset freeze, and ordered the court to issue an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver and ordering the receiver to provide the receiver with a copy of any court proceedings.  On August 4, 2017, the SEC filed an emergency action against the receiver, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) and (3) and of the books and records provision of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 589 (1), 597 (2), 598 (3), and (4) under the books, records, and records provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(b)(2) of Securities Act of 1933, and Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rules 206(3), 206 (4), and 207 (4).  The complaint also alleges that Blackstone violated Section 5 of the Exchange Act by failing to disclose that the receiver had a right to access court records and that he or she had a duty to provide access to those records.  As a result of this conduct, the receiver was not permitted to make any copies of the recorded proceedings, and the court was not required to provide a threshold determination of whether the requested material is a court record.
