  "summary": "On May 25, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Brainlab, Inc., Brainlab AG, Brainlab Medizinische Computersysteme GmbH, and NeuroGrafix AG in a related action.  The court granted the SEC's motion for summary judgment on May 24, 2018.  In its order, the court found that Brainlab and Brainlab had violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to provide sufficient evidence to support its claim that the FiberTracking software is capable of providing accurate, accurate, and non-infringing images of the brain.  According to the court's order, however, the defendants had failed to show that the technology was capable of being used in a manner that satisfies the claims of the patent.  For example, as alleged in the SEC complaint, the fibertracker software is used to process the output from MRI systems made by those manufacturers and does not induce infringement.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, BrainLab and BrainLab agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of judgments that permanently restrains the defendants from violating the federal registration provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Brainlab to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Brainlab also agreed to be enjoined from future securities law violations and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Separately, the SEC granted Brainlab's request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, and the court granted BrainLab\u2019s motion for a hearing on May 26, 2018 in which it agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins Brainlab from violating federal securities law, imposes a $25,000 civil penalty and orders NeuroLab to pay a $20,000 penalty.  NeuroLab has also consented to a $10,000 officer- and director bar, and to a penny stock bar, which will be determined by the court at a later date upon motion by the SEC.   The SEC also granted the defendants\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction against further violations of the anti-fraud provisions. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC also issued an order requiring BrainLab to comply with a court order requiring it to provide an accounting of its alleged violations, including its receipt of a judgment ordering it to pay an $80,000 administrative penalty.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against BrainLab."
