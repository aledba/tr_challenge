  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Connecticut today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order halting an ongoing criminal case against the city of Meriden and its mayor.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that on January 3, 2016, the city council and mayor met at city hall to discuss the search for a city manager. According to the complaint, the mayor and the city manager then met at the meeting, which was conducted in the absence of a quorum of city council members. The complaint alleges that, in gathering, the leadership group prepared a one-page resolution, which included the names of people to be appointed to the committee and detailed the duties of such committee, including recommending to the city's mayor and city manager suitable candidates for the position. The SEC alleges that the meeting was an unnoticed and private meeting in violation of Section 1-200 of the federal securities laws. The court also ruled that the event did not constitute a \"meeting\" within the meaning of \u00a71-200 and, therefore, triggered the open meeting requirements of \u00a7 1-225. In addition, the court ruled that, as a result of the court's finding, the gathering constituted a \"convening or assembly\" of members of a public agency, and that the gathering was not a legitimate meeting. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of the Inspector General today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The investigation was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson, Ms. Barry, and Mr. Gibson. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the Connecticut Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Connecticut Attorney General's Office in this matter."
