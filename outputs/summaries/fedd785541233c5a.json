  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the insurance company and plan administrator that denied David White\u2019s benefits.  The SEC filed a civil injunctive action against LINA on July 26, 2014, alleging that LINA overstated the severity of David White&rsquo;s intoxication or drug use in denying him benefits.&nbsp; The SEC also charged LINA with overstating the number of people who died in a car crash in Arkansas.  In its complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, the SEC alleges that, in July 2014, David and Esther White were in a horrible car crash.  According to the complaint, David was driving and had been exposed to a variety of controlled substances, including amphetamine, opiates, benzodiazepine, and cannabinoids.  As alleged in the SEC's complaint, however, David had been under the influence of drugs at the time of the crash and was likely impaired when he died.  LINA also allegedly failed to provide David with a quantitative drug test that could determine the level of impairment that resulted in his death.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, LINA consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders LINA to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-65-102(4).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against David White.  This matter was investigated by the SEC Enforcement Division's Office of Inspector General and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, and was supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Health and Human Services. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Arkansas State Attorney General's Office, and the Department of Justice Criminal Division in this matter."
