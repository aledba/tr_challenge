  "summary": "On July 24, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered final judgments in favor of Appellant's motion to compel arbitration.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, alleges that, between October 2002 and January 2005, the defendant, Toll Brothers, Inc., a Pennsylvania-based homebuilding company, offered a 10-year warranty for the benefit of the original purchasers of 30 homes.  According to the complaint, however, the warranty did not bind Appellees to the mandatory-arbitration clause in the warranty.  Appellants also alleged that the warranty was not binding on the original purchaser, and that, as a result of the warranty's omission, the subsequent purchaser could not be bound by it.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants failed to comply with mandatory arbitration clauses in the warranties, which require that a subsequent purchaser execute a TB Form 1302.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.   The settlements are subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-17. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
