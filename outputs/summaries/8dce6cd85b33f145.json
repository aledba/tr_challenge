  "summary": "On Jan. 18, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged a New York-based virtual currency trading firm and its chief executive officer with defrauding retail investors.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Patrick K. McDonnell and his company Coin Drop Markets engaged in a fraudulent and unregistered offer and sale of virtual currencies.  According to the complaint, the defendants misappropriated more than $1.5 million of investor funds.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants for their role in the alleged scheme.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, from at least April 2017 through at least July 2017, when the SEC issued an order suspending trading in the virtual currency, McDonnell and Coin Drop used investor funds to pay personal expenses and to make Ponzi-like payments to customers.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission\u2019s complaint, defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their allegedly ill-gotten gains.  Additionally, the court granted the SEC a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendants from further violating the federal securities laws, and ordered the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $110,003,314, which is equal to their alleged profits.  On March 6, 2018 the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against McDonnell, Coin Drop, and its CEO, Christopher G. Giancarlo, alleging that the defendants violated Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that the SEC is entitled to a preliminary injunction against future violations of the charged provisions of the Exchange Act.
