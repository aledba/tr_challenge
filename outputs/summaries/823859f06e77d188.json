  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against 10X Genomics, Inc. (\"10X\"), a microfluidics company, and its co-founder, Dr. Andrew Sia, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17(b)(5) and (c) thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, 10X and Dr. Sia agreed to settle the case by agreeing to pay $23,930,718 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  The SEC alleges that 10X failed to show sufficient evidence to show that it was liable for the alleged violations of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, on May 30, 2017, the United States District Court in Manhattan entered a judgment that permanently enjoins 10X from violating these provisions and orders it to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of the alleged injunctive relief it has received.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions and ordering 10X to pay disgorgements of $3,965,718 plus prejudgment interests of $1,038,767, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $7,500 each.  10X also agreed to pay an $8,500 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  On May 31, 2018, the court granted 10X's motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered it to provide a copy of the final judgment to the jury on June 5, 2018. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Welshhans and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and Ms. Tumolo. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Patent and Trademark Abuse."
