  "summary": "The Daughters of Mary E. Larson have filed a civil injunctive action against the Probate Court for failing to timely approve the payment of attorney's fees to Mary's estate.  The Daughters' complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, alleges that, in 2013, Mary Larson was 86 years old, in deteriorating physical and cognitive health, and living with one of her daughters, Debbie Ratz. The complaint alleges that Mary's probate estate was unable to pay the attorneys' fees due to her deteriorating health.  According to the complaint, Mary filed an application for guardianship of her estate on November 12, 2013, identifying Mary as the proposed ward and seeking to have Ratz appointed as her permanent guardian.  In a complaint filed in federal court in Houston, the Daughters allege that the probate court failed to authorize payment of the lawyers' fees to the executors of Mary Larson's estate, despite repeated requests from Mary's family members to do so.  Mary's executors also allegedly failed to timely respond to the solicitations from the solicitors, and, in one instance, failed to file a timely complaint with the court against a judge who denied all three of Mary's requests for fees.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Mary's attorney, the executor, and the attorney-ad-litem in the earlier guardianship proceeding consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgments also require the estate to pay attorney fees in amounts the court deems equitable and just, to an attorney who represents the person who filed the application for payment of fees from available funds of the estate, and to a neutral third party to be named guardian in a subsequent proceeding from a different court.  As a result, the estate has not been able to pay its fees to a third party in a later proceeding.  Additionally, the Estate has not agreed to a final judgment ordering it to award attorney fees to another party in the same proceeding, or to pay any fees incurred by the estate in the previous proceeding. The Estate has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the amount of attorney fees it has paid to the estate's attorney.  Finally, the settlement agreement requires that the estate pay any attorney fees that are not paid to another person in another proceeding, including for services rendered to a different person in the alternative. The settlement agreement also requires the Estate to pay all legal fees that it deems reasonable and necessary.  For further information, see Litigation Release No."
