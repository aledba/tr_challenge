  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against New Jersey Transit Corporation, a public company that paid out workers' compensation benefits to an injured employee in a work-related automobile accident.  According to the court's order, on December 2, 2014, David Mercogliano was involved in a motor vehicle accident during the course of his employment. As alleged in the complaint, the injured employee was limited by the No Fault Insurance Cost Reduction Act (AICRA) and his employer was liable for reimbursement of the benefits paid to him. In addition, the court held that when an injured worker is injured in work related motor vehicle accidents, he or she is entitled to reimbursement from the employer, even though the injured worker could not recover the amounts it had paid.  The court also held that, in a subrogation action, a worker's compensation carrier has an independent right to seek reimbursement from a third-party tortfeasor when it has not paid any compensation to the injured individual for his economic damages.  In a parallel action, filed in federal district court in Newark, New Jersey, on May 24, 2016, the Court granted the SEC's motion for summary judgment in favor of NJ Transit. The SEC's request for a preliminary injunction, a temporary restraining order, and an officer-and-director bar against the defendants from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and a civil injunctive action against the company. The Court also issued an order suspending the settlement of the complaint.  On May 26, 2018, the SEC filed an emergency action in which it obtained a partial summary judgment against all defendants in a related action. The court found that defendants negligently caused the accident and that their claims were barred by the collateral source rule, which prohibits third parties from recovering compensation from injured workers, and that the company had a duty to reimburse the injured injured employee.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $33,625.70, comprised of $6694.04 in medical benefits, $3982.40 in indemnity benefits, and $22,949.26 in pre-judgment interest. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Separately, the United States Attorney's Office for New Jersey announced criminal charges against one of the injured workers."
