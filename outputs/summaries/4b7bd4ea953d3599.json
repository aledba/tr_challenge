  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against San Diego-based Grill-A-Burger owner Antonio Cuevas-Martinez for malicious prosecution.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Palm Desert, California, alleges that, from at least April 2015 through April 2016, CuevasMartinez violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that he violated the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, and that he aided and abetted the defendants' violations of those provisions. In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in a pattern of misappropriation of trade secrets and failed to provide sufficient evidence to support a judgment in their favor. The SEC alleges that in addition to failing to show cause of action, the defendants also failed to demonstrate that they had any reasonable basis to believe they had a reasonable chance of prevailing on the merits of a subsequent malicious prosecution claim.  In a parallel action, on May 24, 2016, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of California entered a judgment against Cuevas Martinez, finding him liable for violating the anti-SLAPP provision of the federal securities laws. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of alleged profits and losses, and a civil penalty of $1.5 million. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the court also ordered Cuevas Martinez to pay a $1,500 civil penalty. The judgment also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of $30,000, prejudgment interest of $2,038, and civil penalties of $100,000. The defendants also agreed to be barred from serving as officers or directors of any public company. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Zamos and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)."
