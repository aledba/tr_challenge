  "summary": "On April 10, 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California entered a final judgment against Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck, ordering the city to impound a vehicle driven by an unlicensed driver without a valid driver's license.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Beck violated the antifraud provisions of Section 14602.6 of the California Vehicle Code.  The complaint alleges that, in violation of the federal securities laws, Beck unlawfully impounded a motor vehicle in the course of impounding it.  In a parallel action, the California Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Beck, charging him with violating Section 14603.6 and 14607.6.  Beck has agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, and agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,500. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On April 24, 2012 the Umpqua County District Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced that it filed a civil injunctive action against Beck.  As part of the settlement, the court agreed to a permanent injunction against Beck and to the imposition of a $500,000 civil penalty against him. The court's order also prohibits Beck from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any such order. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by the Los Angeles Regional Office and the Division of Enforcement's Asset Management Unit. The litigation will be led by Mr. Beck and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI and the California Office of Inspector General in this matter."
