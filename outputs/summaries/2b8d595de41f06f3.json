  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against two insurance companies for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky, alleges that Paul Gray and Michael Gray violated the federal anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Gray and Gray falsely claimed that their son, Liam Gray, negligently shot Andrew in the eye with a BB gun, and that neither of them believed that the BB gun would have sufficient velocity to hit Andrew.  In fact, the complaint alleges that the Grays' son, Andrew, had been \"best friends\" since \"a little bit before kindergarten\" and had been practicing together since kindergarten.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Gray has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(3) and (a)(4) of federal securities law, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $5,000 and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Gray has also agreed to pay a $20,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13, or 13(b)(2)(A) of 2018. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can also use the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals and to find out whether they have any experience with investing in an insurance policy.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court against Gray, charging him with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and with violating Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1, and aiding and abetting Gray's violations of Exchange Act Section 5(b).  In a parallel action, the U.K. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Gray.  This case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC Enforcement Division's Asset Management Unit, John R. Kelly of the Philadelphia Regional Office, and Amy C. Welshhans of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Attorney General's Office and the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office."
