  "summary": "On May 11, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Kornitzky Group, LLC, a New Jersey-based company that performed maintenance on turbine engine bearings.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, in August 2011, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued Kornitzer Group an air agency certificate, which authorized it to inspect and repair engine bearings in accordance with a military specification it presented to the FAA.  According to the complaint, the FAA's certification requirements required that a company perform maintenance on engine bearings without the requisite technical data.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the company failed to disclose that it had inspected the bearings and had disassembled and repaired them.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's order, the company consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining it from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal certification requirements.  KORNitzky also agreed to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Finally, the Commission agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins the company from violating these provisions and orders it to comply with the agency's order.  On May 12, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty against the company.   The Commission's investigation was conducted by Darren Pittacora and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Office of Inspector General, and the New Jersey Office of Inspections and Examinations."
