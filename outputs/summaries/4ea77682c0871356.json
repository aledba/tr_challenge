  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a trustee who defrauded a trust beneficiary out of more than $1 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Elverta, California, alleges that Melissa P. Reynoso violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b) thereunder.  According to the complaint, Reynoso consented to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  In its judgment, the court found that Reynoso breached her fiduciary duties by acting in bad faith and imposing personal liability for attorney fees and costs against the trustee.  Pizarro also agreed to pay $1.5 million in prejudgment interest and a $500,000 civil penalty.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, however, that the judgment did not impose personal liability on Reynoso because she did not take an unfounded position and sold the property to BARTHOLOMEW, a daughter of the trustee, who was not a party to the action.  Instead, the judgment imposed personal liability against Reynoso based on her conduct as trustee and, in a parallel action, ordered her to pay a civil penalty of $1,500.  On the same day, the SEC filed an emergency action against Bartholomew, ordering her to repay $265,000 in attorney fees, costs, and interest she owed to the trustee in the emergency action. The SEC also issued an order suspending the sale of the El Verano real estate to a trustee in violation of its equitable powers over trust assets.  Without admitting to the SEC's findings, PIZARRO agreed to the settlement without admitting the allegations of the complaint in the court's judgment.  A final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement of $2,965, which is equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest he has already paid to the trust, and orders the trustee to pay attorney fees to her husband and jointly and severally, to pay the trust's share of the trust proceeds.  An SEC order also prohibits the trustee from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in a public offering of a real estate and from issuing or selling any security, including the right to reapply as a trustee after a court order requires such an order to be issued by the court.  This settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17"
