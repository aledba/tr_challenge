  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Core Laboratories, LP (\"Core Lab\"), a Louisiana-based manufacturing company, for failing to timely pay for unpaid wages.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that, from January through December 2016, Rick Calamia, Jr., was employed by Core Lab as an Inspector II in the position of Inspector II. According to the complaint, Calamia alleges that at the time of his termination, Core Lab failed to pay him for 73.8 hours of unpaid wages at his regular pay rate of $24.00 per hour, totaling $1,808.16. The complaint further alleges that Mr. Calamia was not entitled to compensation for unused vacation time, because he was on a leave of absence for the last scheduled workday preceding and the workday following the holiday. In addition, the complaint alleges that in addition to the unpaid wages, he was entitled to a balance of paid vacation time and paid for sick leave, which he claimed was due to him upon termination.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $1.8 million. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Calamia.  On May 23, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Core Lab, charging Calamia with violating the anti-fraud provision of the federal securities laws. The SEC is continuing its investigation into Calamia's alleged misconduct. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.
