  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Hawai'i today entered a final judgment against a Honolulu Police Department officer who was found guilty of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also entered an order suspending the officer from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a witness in an OVUII case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 20, 2017, Officer Manueli Kotobalavu reviewed his report for the second time while testifying before the court and observed that Wakamoto's eyes were red and watery and that he had just finished a double shift at work.  As alleged in the complaint, the officer had just come from a bar to pick up a friend and Wakamoto took ten steps instead of the instructed nine, and missed a few heel-to-toes, where his heel missed his toe by about one inch.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the officer was not properly allowed to testify about the field sobriety test because he had no present recollection of the test.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint and the court's order suspending Wakamoto, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities for a period of five years, and requires him to provide a copy of the final judgment to the court.  On November 22, 2017 the court granted the defendant's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the officer to return to his duties as an officer.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by C. Wright and V. Gold of the Public Finance Abuse Unit, and the case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gold and supervised by Chedly L. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Hawaii, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations, the Hawaii Department of Health and Human Services Criminal Investigation Division, the Office of Inspector General's Office, the FBI's Cyber Unit, the Air Force Criminal Investigations Division, and other relevant agencies."
