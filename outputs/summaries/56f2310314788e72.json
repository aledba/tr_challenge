  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Texas today entered a final judgment in favor of a former general manager of a Texas-based restaurant who was terminated for his alleged role in a campaign against him.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Austin, Texas on March 10, 2014, Randall Remaley was terminated by TA Operating LLC d/b/a TravelCenters of America based on alleged disparate treatment arising from his termination.  The complaint alleges that Remaley, who was 55 years old at the time of his termination, was replaced by a 45-year-old female who engaged in similar conduct but was not fired.  As alleged in the complaint, Remaley's termination was the culmination of a campaign that began when Swisher became his supervisor in late 2013 and recruited his younger female replacement at least seven days before he was fired, which she accepted the same day the offer was made.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, REMaley has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $10,000, which will be offset by a civil penalty of $5,000.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General today announced criminal charges against Remaley arising from the same conduct alleged by the complaint.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the United States District Court in Austin granted a temporary restraining order and ordered Remaley to comply with the court order.  Separately, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Ford Motor Co. v. Castillo, 583 S.W.3d at 583, and a related administrative proceeding against Yselta Indep. Sch. Welshhans, 206 S. W. 3d at 917.  A hearing on May 26, 2018 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. for Remaley.

An SEC examination that led to the investigation of this matter was conducted by Kelly L. Gibson of the Enforcement Division's Fort Worth Regional Office, and was supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Fort Worth office.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Texas State Attorney General's Office."
