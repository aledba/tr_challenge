  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against defendant Scott Bailey, finding him liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Bailey and his wife, Haven Sooter, were driving erratically when they stopped at a traffic light at the intersection of Ladue Road and Lindbergh Boulevard on July 8, 2016. Bailey allegedly passed a black BMW at a high rate of speed and they collided with Koutroubis, who was driving a white SUV. According to the complaint, Bailey objected to the use of a transcript of the dash-cam video because it was not verified by the person who transcribed the video. Bailey also alleged that the court improperly forced the jurors to continue deliberating after the jury sent notes to the trial court.  Bailey also alleges that the judge failed to maintain an appearance of neutrality when he questioned the conduct of the jury during trial.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Bailey and Sooter. Bailey has agreed to settle the SEC's charges against him by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of four years imprisonment, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On May 9, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Bailey, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against Bailey. The SEC previously issued an order suspending Bailey from appearing or practicing before the SEC as a trial judge. The court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Bailey to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $1,078,767, which Bailey has already agreed to pay in a civil monetary penalty of $10,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC, Bailey has consented to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of the Federal securities laws and ordering him to return to the country of his birth. The judgment also prohibits Bailey from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the future, and from making or selling any investment in any securities, including securities in any public company. In addition, the court has ordered Bailey not to participate in any offering of securities that may be prejudgmented by the alleged misconduct"
