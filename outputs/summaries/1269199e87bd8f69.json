  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California today entered a final judgment against a former sheriff's deputy for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that Robert Hughes, a retired deputy for the County of San Bernardino, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Hughes was not entitled to an administrative hearing because he was no longer an employee entitled to one.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Hughes was barred from serving as an officer or director of a public safety agency when he was served with allegations of misconduct, which resulted in a 15-day suspension and the loss of about $7,000 in wages.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Hughes consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the Exchange Act, and orders him to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Hughes also agreed to be permanently enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with an administrative proceeding against him, and to the appointment of a receiver to determine whether to hold a hearing for him in the event of a disciplinary action.  On May 24, 2012, the San Bernardino County Civil Service Commission (CSC) appointed a hearing officer to consider Hughes's motion for a hearing on his pending administrative appeal. The hearing officer agreed to the hearing officer's recommendation, which was accepted by the court without prejudice.  After the hearing, the court granted the Commission's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the hearing to be conducted by a certified mediator.  A hearing officer will determine the outcome of the case upon motion by the Commission.  An administrative hearing will be scheduled for June 13, 2013.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (January 24, 2013).  The Commission appreciates the assistance of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Insurance, and the California Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
