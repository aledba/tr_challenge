  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment in favor of Wanda Irish and her husband, Dennis Irish, in a defamation action brought by the city of Harrison, Idaho.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Harrison, Wanda and Dennis Irish made statements to the public in May 2012, after discovering that Dennis Irish and his business partner had been stalking Dona Hall while she was standing near the side of a public road.  The complaint alleges that the defendants made the statements because they were concerned about the safety of the public and wanted the public to know that Dennis and Wanda were stocking U2 albums for sale.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In addition, the court granted the Halls' request for an asset freeze and a temporary restraining order, and ordered the Halls to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Salt Lake Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Idaho Office of the Attorney General."
