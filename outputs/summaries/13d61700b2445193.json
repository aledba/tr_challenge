  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York today entered a final judgment against Second Church of Christ, Scientist, Inc., a Boston-based charitable trust, and its trustee, Alco Gravure, in a parallel action.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Hampshire on May 22, 2017, Second Church and Gravure raised the issue of standing in connection with the dissolution of the charitable trust.  The complaint alleges that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Second Church also alleges that, in violation of Section 15(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rule 15b2-1, the trustees failed to comply with certain requirements of the trust, including that the trust be audited by an independent auditor, and that the trustees did not comply with an order requiring them to submit independent audits of the trusts.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that Second Church failed to disclose to the trustees that it had a \"special interest\" in the trust when it distributed the trust funds solely to the Mother Church.  Without admitting or denying Second Church's allegations, the court agreed to the court's order requiring Second Church to pay a civil penalty of $100,000 and to appoint an independent trustee to oversee the trust's distribution of funds. The court also granted Second Church a temporary restraining order, which prohibits Second Church from associating with any third party that has a conflict of interest with the trust. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the New Hampshire Office of the Attorney General and the Division of Enforcement's Office of Inspector General. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Gravure and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The case is being supervised by Ansu Banerjee.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Massachusetts, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 564-B:4-405(c).  The SEC encourages the public to check the backgrounds of people who are claiming to be members of a charitable trust by using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Investor.gov\u00c2\u00a0to identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Office and the Office of Advocacy and Education under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone."
