  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New Hampshire today entered a final judgment against a New Hampshire man charged with defaming law enforcement officers.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Hampshire, alleges that Robert Frese violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that Frese consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000. The judgment also orders Frese to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and a $2,500 civil penalty. Frese has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company. The court's order also prohibits Frese from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts today announced criminal charges against Frese.  Frese agreed to settle the SEC's charges without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, and agreed to a permanent injunction, to be followed by an officer-and-director bar, and to a conduct-based injunction prohibiting him from violating the First and Second Amendment provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\"). The court also granted Frese's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an accounting of the amount of money that he has already spent on his legal fees and on other personal expenses. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New Hampshire Attorney General's Office, and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
