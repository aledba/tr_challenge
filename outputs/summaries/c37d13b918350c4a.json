  "summary": "On February 28, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's order, filed on November 21, 2016, Pope, Schumacher, and St. Mary's Regional Medical Center (\"St. Marys\"), filed a complaint in the Pope County Circuit Court alleging that summonses issued to certain individuals were fatally defective because they failed to include the names of the defendants in the summonses.  The SEC alleges that the defendants' summonses, which were purportedly defective, did not comply with the requirements of Rule 4(b).  The court also ruled that defendants could not be held liable for breach of contract, wrongful termination, and tortious interference with the professional-services contract that Dr. Johnson executed with Pope.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Pope. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in the District of North Carolina, charges Pope with violations of Section 5 of the federal securities laws. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The court granted the request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, and issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.  On March 2, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Pope for violations of Rule 5 of\u00c2\u00a04(b), which requires defendants to respond within 120 days of filing a complaint, as required by the court's order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $30,000, $50,000 in disgorgment, and $30 a day in prejudgment interests. The defendants also agreed to be barred from serving as officers or directors of a public company for five years.  Finally, the court agreed to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the securities laws, ordering them to comply with Rule 5, ordering the receiver to pay a $20,000 civil penalty, and ordering the receivers to provide for an accounting of the funds owed to the receiver in the receiver's possession. The receiver agreed to pay $10,000.  To settle the case,"
