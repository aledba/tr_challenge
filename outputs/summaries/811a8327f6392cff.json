  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Missouri man who was convicted of domestic violence.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that R.D.T. (Mother) and C.L.W. (Father) violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that, as a result of Father\u2019s past domestic violence, he was at great risk of becoming an unfit parent.  According to the complaint, Mother filed a best-interest determination in October 2016 that, after determining there were reasonable grounds for termination, Father left the state, violated his parole, and committed another domestic violence-related felony.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri today announced criminal charges against Father.  On May 24, 2018, the U. S. District Judge for the Northern District of Mississippi granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000, and imposes a $75,000 civil penalty against him, and bars him from participating in any court-ordered family reunification.   The court also issued an order suspending Father from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by L.A.
