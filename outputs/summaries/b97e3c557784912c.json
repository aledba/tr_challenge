  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Maine today entered judgments against the father of two children who was found unfit to parent them.  The court found that the father violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17(b)(2)(a) and (c) thereunder. The court also found that, contrary to the court's findings, the father was unable or unwilling to take responsibility for the children and failed to consider open adoptions that would have left the children with three legal parents.  In its order granting the father's request for a temporary restraining order, the court also ordered the father to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of time that each child spent with the father and contact rights to the stepfather.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the judgment, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently restrains and enjoins him from violating these provisions. The judgment also prohibits the father from acting as an unregistered broker or dealer in the securities of any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, and from participating in any offering of an investment in a company or investment in an entity.  On May 22, 2019, a federal district court in Portland, Maine entered judgments terminating the father\u2019s parental rights with regard to the children.  According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint filed in federal court in Maine on June 10, 2019 and unsealed on July 24, 2018, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder of the federal securities laws. The settlement is subject to court approval. The defendants agreed not to violate the federal laws, and the court granted their requests for a preliminary injunction, a civil injunctive relief, and an officer-and-director bar. The judge granted the defendants' requests for an emergency court order and a hearing to determine whether to proceed with an administrative proceeding. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Maine Office of Advocacy and Education. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Maine Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
