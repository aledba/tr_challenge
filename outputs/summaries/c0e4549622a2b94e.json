  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Kentucky-based manufacturer KYB Corporation and its subsidiary, KAC Americas Corporation, in a class action action brought by investors and others alleging that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, alleges that, beginning in 2016, KYB and KAC agreed to the entry of an arbitration provision that, in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association, requires that all purchasers of covered KYB products return defective products to distributors, which distributors must inspect, and upon satisfaction that the products are covered under the warranty, the distributors must replace/exchange the part for the consumer.  According to the complaint, this arbitration provision is a \"delegation provision\" that requires a court to determine whether a party has agreed to arbitrate a particular dispute.  In addition, the complaint alleges that defendants did not form an arbitration agreement with KAC, and that neither the agreement nor the arbitration provision applies to all of the parties.  As a result, defendants are not \"original retail purchasers\" under the agreed-upon arbitration provision.  For example, as set forth in the SEC's Complaint, defendants agreed to arbitration only where the court is satisfied that the parties did not agree to arbitration and that its enforceability or applicability to the dispute is in issue.  Defendants also agreed not to participate in the issuance or purchase of any arbitration agreement, even though they agreed to do so in the first instance.  Specifically, Defendants agreed to make the Limited Warranty available to \"all purchasers \"in accordance with AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules, which require that each party to submit a warranty claim to an arbitrator.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC complaint, Defendants have consented to entry of judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties against each of them.  Additionally, defendants have agreed to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, which is equal to the penalty imposed by the court upon each party in the case.  Finally, the court agreed to appoint a receiver to determine the threshold question of arbitrability for each of these claims.  Among other things, the defendants agreed not only to arbitration, but also to pay civil penalties of $150,000 and $75,000"
