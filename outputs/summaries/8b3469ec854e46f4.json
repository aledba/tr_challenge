  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Kentucky today announced criminal charges against a former Kentucky State Police trooper for his role in a series of high-profile shootings.  According to the SEC's complaint, on November 11, 2002, Trooper Keith Baker was dispatched to the home of Bruce and Kathy Haley, in Bell County, Kentucky, to investigate a reported feud between the Dozier and Haley families. The complaint alleges that, on the morning of the alleged shooting, Haley and his partner, Phillip Gray, went up to the residence of Michael and Rhonda dozier in Gatlinburg, not knowing Haley was married, and were confronted by a man who allegedly shot Gray multiple times in the back and left arm. As alleged in the complaint, Gray told the officers that he was able to see the perpetrator at night, but did not tell them that he had been shot. Gray also allegedly did not know that Haley was in jail the night of the prior shooting.  The complaint further alleges that Gray was the first to fire, and that the second shot was fired from the same gun. The SEC alleges that neither Gray nor Haley were able to identify the person who shot Gray.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Haley, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $160,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, pay a $150,000 civil penalty, and pay a conduct-based injunction. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit, and the case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Gibson. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Kentucky Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kentucky Secretary of State's Office and the Kentucky Department of Criminal Justice."
