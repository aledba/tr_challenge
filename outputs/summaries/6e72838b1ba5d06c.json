  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of California yesterday entered a final judgment against Flintco Pacific, Inc., a California-based general engineering and general building contractor, finding that Flintco violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  The court also ordered Flintco to pay $327,050 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Los Angeles, Flintco submitted a bid to TEC in May 2011 for $1,272,960 for a curtain-and-glazing project for Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill, California. The bid contained terms and conditions that materially conflicted with those in TEC's bid, and Flintco's bid contained \"red flags\" to avoid problems during negotiations that could cause TEC to lose the subcontractor.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount Flintco has already paid to the contractor. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Stump and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The litigation will be led by Mr. Stump. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Office of Compliance and Inspections and Examinations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
