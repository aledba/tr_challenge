  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment against a defendant who defrauded a San Francisco-based real estate investment company out of $1.2 million.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that Paul Thurston, a resident of Utah, made material misrepresentations to a trial jury in 2006 concerning the outcome of a McGillis Litigation.  According to the complaint, Thurston told the jury that he had bought his interest in the 310 Townsend project by borrowing over $4 million from McGillis, and that he was acting on behalf of a group of developers from southern California.  Thurston also allegedly told one of the developers that the project was experiencing delays and delays in obtaining permits.   The complaint further alleges that Thurston knew that McGillis was experiencing problems with the project and had cited those problems as justification for an extension on the loan.  In addition, the complaint alleges that after learning of the McGillis litigation Thurston had repaid the loan to the developer, he had not invested his own cash equity in the project but instead had funded his investment by borrowing money from the developer.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Thurston to pay a civil penalty of $356,141, an amount equal to the amount of his disgorgement plus prejudgment interest thereon.  Finally, the court granted Thurston\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order and ordered him to comply with the court order.  On May 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Paul G. Sansone of the United States District Court in Utah entered a judgment permanently enjoining Thurston from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge $2 million in ill-gotten gains plus interest, and imposing a $50,000 civil penalty against Thurston. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Division of Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Utah Office of Inspector General in this matter."
