  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the City of Pendergrass and two former city officials in a civil action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, alleges that the City Administrator and Chief of Police violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") by failing to grant the City's motion for a directed verdict.  According to the complaint, Appellee Rintoul was the City Clerk for the City from January 2005 to July 2009, when she was hired as City Clerk by the City as a city employee. The complaint alleges that, in June 2009, after learning of the city\u2019s alleged misappropriation of city funds, Appellelee Garner resigned her position as city clerk and was subsequently barred from serving as a public employee.  In a parallel action, on January 30, 2018, the Atlanta Regional District Court granted the City and eight individual city officials an emergency asset freeze and ordered them to return their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The court also issued a temporary restraining order and ordered the city to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay disgorgement of $218,000 plus interest of $2,038, and orders the City to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On January 31, the court granted the city and eight city officials a partial judgment against them, ordering them to disgorge their alleged misstatements, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in a parallel administrative proceeding. The final judgment also prohibits the city from appointing a new chief of police or appointing an attorney. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against future violations, a conduct-based injunction, an officer-and-director bar, and a penny stock bar against the city.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by John Rymas of the Atlanta Office of Public Education and the Office of Inspector General, with assistance from Eric Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson and Ms. Werner."
