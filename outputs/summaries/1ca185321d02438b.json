  "summary": "On December 17, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole that permanently enjoins Marshall from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 13(a)(1) of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Philadelphia, alleges that the Board violated its discretion in denying Marshall credit for time spent at liberty on parole and inadequately explaining its denial of credit.  According to the complaint, Marshall was on parole for murder in the third degree and robbery when he was sentenced to 11 to 22 years in prison for a felony drug-related felony, with a maximum date of January 15, 2019.  Marshall's conviction for possession of a controlled substance in Delaware, for which he received an eight-year sentence, was deemed satisfied by the Board's determination that he was entitled to a mandatory minimum of 10 years of street time.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order, Marshall consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the above-mentioned provisions.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Marshall.  To learn more about the federal sentencing laws, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13(b)(2)(A) and No. 1233 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13b2-3 thereunder.  For further information, see Judgment No. 17-cv-1 (2017).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Philadelphia Regional Office, under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone, Regional Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections in this matter."
