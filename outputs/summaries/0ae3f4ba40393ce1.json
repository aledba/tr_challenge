  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Juan Alejandro Rodriguez Cuya, Jr., a former director of the Miami office of the Department of Justice, ordering him to pay over $2 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Miami, alleges that Rodriguez and his companies engaged in a scheme to defraud Spanish-speaking residents of the United States of approximately $2.2 million.  According to the complaint, the defendants used scripts he had composed to extort money from victims by demanding they pay for fabricated orders by threatening them with bogus lawsuits, detentions, and seizures of property.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants made numerous phone calls to Guerrero and Moio, telling them that they were attorneys and that they would threaten to institute legal actions against victims unless they paid a large fine for items they had not ordered or had not received, and would relent when the victims agreed to pay 10 to 30 percent of the fine with a credit card.  As alleged in the SEC\u2019s complaint, Rodriguez and the companies violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Complaint, Rodriguez has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, impose a $25,000 civil penalty, and bar him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  Rodriguez has also agreed to a five-year officer-and-director bar and to pay a $20,000 penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1171 (11th Cir. 2010).  The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Miami Office of Inspector General, and the Miami Police Department in this matter."
