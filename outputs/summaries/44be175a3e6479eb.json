According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Missouri, Barnett, then a resident of Mineral Point, Missouri, broke into the home of his grandparents, Clifford and Leona Barnett, while they were attending church activities.

Sansone of the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued an order imposing a preliminary injunction against Barnett, ordering him to surrender his passport, and appointing a receiver of his assets to facilitate his repatriation.
