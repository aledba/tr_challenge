  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas today entered a final judgment against the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New Orleans, ordering a preliminary injunction against the construction of a barge fleeting facility.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that Friends of Lydia Ann Channel, a nonfederal defendant, violated the antifraud provisions of Section 9 of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, contrary to Friends\u2019s claims, LACM failed to prepare an environmental impact statement for its fleeting facility, which is intended to protect the endangered Green Sea Turtle and Ridley Sea Turtle. According to the complaint, the defendants simply \u201cdon\u2019t want all these barges there.\u201d  The complaint further alleges that the defendants failed to adequately consider the risks posed by the temporary nature of the temporary mooring facility, and failed to consider the practicality of the injunction.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Friends consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the defendants from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders the defendants to pay a civil penalty of $10,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In its order, the court also granted the defendants a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from further violating the anti-fraud provisions, and issued an order freezing the assets of the defendants and prohibiting them from acquiring or selling any of the properties of the companies or their associated entities. The court's order also prohibits Friends from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security-related product or service, including the right to reapply after five years. The order also bars Friends from associating with any broker dealer or investment adviser that may be associated with a broker dealer, and prohibits the purchase, sale, or offer of any securities in connection with the issuance of any such order. The SEC also prohibits the sale, offer and sale of securities in the securities of any broker, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal planning organization, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  On the SEC's continuing investigation, the agency's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's litigation against the agency is continuing. The case is being handled by John R. Rymas and Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and Ms. B."
