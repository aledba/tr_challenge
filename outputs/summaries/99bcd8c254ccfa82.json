  "summary": "On February 23, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Westmoreland County entered a final judgment in favor of SBA Towers IX, LLC, a radio frequency engineer for Verizon Wireless, and its application for a special exception to construct a communications tower in an R-1 zoning district.  According to the court's order, on January 19, 2016, SBA and Verizon filed an application with the ZHB for a temporary restraining order to prevent them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court found that the defendants failed to adequately demonstrate that the proposed communications tower complies with all applicable federal and state safety regulations.  In its order, the court also ordered SBA to provide a copy of the Commission's finding, which, in its opinion, was not sufficient to justify the defendants' actions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  On February 24, 2017, the SEC filed an emergency action in which it obtained an emergency court order halting SBA's and Verizon's applications for an emergency relief order, freezing the assets of the defendants, and ordering the defendants to pay civil penalties of $150,000 each.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
