  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maine today announced criminal charges against a Massachusetts man accused of sexually abusing his daughter.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Portland, Maine, alleges that William Gaudet violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment that permanently restrains the SEC's asset freeze and freezes the defendants' assets.  On May 1, 2018, the court granted a motion for a temporary restraining order and entered an order freezing the defendants assets and imposing a civil monetary penalty of $1,000,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering disgorgements and prejudgment interests, and imposing civil penalties of up to $2,500.  A hearing on the matter was scheduled for May 24, 2018.  Gaudette's attorney, Eric R. Karpel, filed an emergency action on May 2, 2018 to halt the proceedings against him.  He has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunctive injunction, and to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of his prison time he has already been sentenced to.  To learn more about obstruction of justice, see Litigation Release No. 539 (1st Cir. 2010).  The case is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit.  For additional information, see Criminal Justice Reform Bulletin Bulletin No. 17-cv-539 (January 26, 2018).  In its continuing investigation, the Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigation Release\u00c2\u00a0to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support a finding of guilt.\u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has also issued an Investor Alert to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC\u00c2\u00a0institutions.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals. \u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a civil action on June 13, 2018 against Matthew Danner, a Massachusetts resident who was convicted of two felony counts of child molestation.
