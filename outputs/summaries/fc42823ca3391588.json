  "summary": "On October 21, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Maryland entered a final judgment against Jason Andrew Poole in contempt of a court order requiring him to pay child support for his son, to appellee, Jessie Roebuck (\u201cMother\u201d). The court also found that Poole was entitled to recover attorney's fees in contempt actions arising out of court orders to support the child of a parent who had been in contempt. According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Carroll County, Maryland, Poole, a landscaper, and his girlfriend, Sherry Few, were charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC alleges that, in violation of Section 12-103 of the Exchange Act, Father was in contempt for failing to pay spousal or child support, and the court found him in contempt in a contempt action. The court granted Poole's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordered him to disgorge $2,104.20 of the $4,340.00 that he owed, and appointed a Special Prosecutor for the Office of the Attorney General to represent him in the contempt proceeding. The Court also granted the Fosters' request for an attorney's fee to be determined by the court at a hearing on November 12, 2015.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Maryland Office of Inspector General, the Carroll County Office of Child and Family Education, the Baltimore Office of Advocacy, the Washington Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Maryland Secretary of State's Office."
