  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Colorado today entered a final judgment against the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in a related administrative proceeding.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Denver, Colorado, alleges that the agency violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Rule 17b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the federal agency unlawfully determined that it had no duty to perform a \u201cconformity\u201d analysis under the Clean Air Act (CAA) when it conducted two oil-and-gas leases in northeast Colorado in May and November 2015. The complaint further alleges that BLM did not perform a full conformity analysis for those leases because it did not know how many wells would be drilled and how many would be developed.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, contrary to BLM's representations to the court, BLM failed to consider the relevant data presented to it, including that the CAA does not require the use of worst-case assumptions, or analyses where it is impossible to assess local air quality impacts, such as ozone precursor emissions.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them. The final judgments also order BLM to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000, which will be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  On May 24, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica entered final judgments against BLM and WildEarth, ordering the agency to comply with the court's order. The court also ordered BLM to provide a copy of the final judgment, which is subject to court approval, to be filed by the SEC as part of a continuing investigation. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Secretary of State's Office, and the Colorado Department of Natural Resources."
