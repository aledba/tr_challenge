  "summary": "On May 26, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against YouNow, Inc. and Resorb Networks, Inc., charging them with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Manhattan, alleges that YouNow and its founder, Adi Sideman, created a website to facilitate the creation and operation of YouNow.  According to the complaint, the website was designed to facilitate users' access to YouNow through a computer or an application, and that users could sign in as a user by simply opening their web browser and clicking on the \"sign-in\" button at the bottom of the website.  In addition, the complaint alleges that, from March 10, 2015 until May 5, 2015, Ianuale spent 1,162 minutes on a category called \u201cPolicy,\u201d which includes the terms of use, and the variations on those.  As alleged, the defendants did not agree to arbitrate and that, if they did, another agreement supersedes the agreement with the arbitration provision.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's action, YouNow has agreed to the entry of an order permanently enjoining it from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and ordering it to pay a civil penalty of $1,000.  Additionally, the court has ordered YouNow to pay an $80,000 civil penalty, which is equal to the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties that will be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  On May 27, 2016 the court entered a temporary restraining order against You Now and the defendants, barring them from using the company's website, ordering them to provide a copy of the complaint to the court, and imposing a $20,000 penalty.  Following the court's order, the company agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these charged provisions, and orders them to pay civil penalties of $100,000 each.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York State Attorney General's Office, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, the United States Postal Inspection Service, and"
