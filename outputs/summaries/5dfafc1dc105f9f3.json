  "summary": "On January 13, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Rhonda Lynn Edinger, a Pennsylvania resident who was denied Social Security benefits in March 2017.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that the Commission of Social Security (Commissioner) improperly classified her as a \"treating source\" for her carpal tunnel syndrome.  According to the complaint, Edinger filed claims for disability insurance benefits (DIB) and supplemental security income (SSI) on March 2, 2015, and alleged that the ALJ incorrectly concluded that Ms. Edinger had a severe impairment, that she had a \"severe impairment,\" and that she was unable to perform \"basic work activities.\"  The complaint further alleges that in making this determination, the Commission improperly cherry-picked from Dr. Ahn's evidence, presenting an improper hypothetical to the vocational expert, and failing to give sufficient weight to the testimony of the technical expert.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission's decision, Ms.Edinger consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York today announced criminal charges against Edinger.   The Commission's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the SEC's Philadelphia Regional Office and is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
