  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a default judgment against Iran for its role in a September 20, 1984 terrorist attack on the United States Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that on the morning of the attack, a suicide bomber drove a vehicle loaded with explosives toward the building and detonated it at the front of the building.  According to the complaint, the blast injured seven American service members, including Kevin Barry, Alan Bigler, John McKennan, Bernard Woerz, and Jeremy Zeikel, who were among those injured in the attack. The complaint further alleges that Mr. Bigler was injured in a car accident and required extensive medical treatment, including surgery to remove shrapnel from his right eye and a hearing loss in his left ear.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Michael Milroy was injured by the blast and was required to return to his job as an officer and director of a foreign state to recover his lost earnings.  As alleged, Milroy's injuries were so severe that he was unable to assist others who were injured and sought medical attention.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion of the SEC.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-1214 (January 23, 2019).  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the repatriation of American personnel from Lebanon to the Middle East. The receiver has also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $7 million, which is equal to the amount of his or her actual ill-gotten gains.  On August 22, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Iran, charging it with aiding and abetting violations of Section 1605A of the federal securities laws, and with violating the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 16(a)(3) and 17(b)(2) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction against further violations of the above-mentioned provisions, as well as an order requiring the receiver to provide a copy of the complaint to the receiver. In a related administrative proceeding, the court issued a temporary restraining order"
