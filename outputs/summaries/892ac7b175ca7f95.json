  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former prison employee for failing to exhaust his administrative remedies.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Kevin Forde was arrested and taken to the Federal Detention Center in Miami, Florida, where he experienced multiple seizures and took an anti-seizure medication called Tegretol. According to the complaint, Mr. Forde informed the intake nurse, Ricardo Varela, that he suffered from seizures, took the medication, and that he was unable to file an administrative complaint because he did not recognize the name of the drug prescribed by the correctional officer on duty. The complaint also alleges that, despite having access to an Inmate Handbook, the inmate in Goebert's cell did not file an out-of-time grievance until after the district court dismissed his case on August 23, 2016. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Forde. The SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the prison employee, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting violations of Rule 12(b)(1) and 13a-14 thereunder of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-1 thereunder. The court agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC charged a housing unit correctional officer with failing to timely respond to an inmate\u2019s request for an extension of his or her administrative proceedings. The officer, Ramon Salazar, agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and to pay a $1,000 civil penalty. The judge also agreed to an order appointing a receiver to oversee the receiver. The receiver, Antonio Cruz, was not required to respond to the inmate. In addition, the receiver did not receive a copy of the BOP grievance procedure before filing his complaint.  On August 17, 2016, a federal district court in Atlanta, Georgia, granted the receiver a temporary restraining order and issued an order requiring him to submit a written response to the receiver within 20 days of the alleged misconduct. The order also requires the receiver to provide an accounting of the amount of time spent on the receiver before filing a complaint with the court.  A hearing on August 24, 2016 was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. The hearing was delayed until the receiver received the receiver's response, and the receiver called an ambulance."
