  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment in favor of the District Attorney's Office's motion for a temporary restraining order against a Chicago-area juvenile detention center.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that on August 4, 2018, 12-year-old Mathias H. of Chicago, Illinois, committed the offenses of armed robbery, aggravated robbery, and robbery at a GameStop store.  According to the complaint, H. was placed on home confinement with electronic monitoring because he was in seventh grade and was not armed with a weapon during the offense.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against H. for his role in the alleged scheme.   The complaint alleges that H. violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $100,000.  H. also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  Judge Michael P. Toomin of the Chicago Regional Office issued an order suspending H. from appearing or practicing before the court as an attorney.  He also ordered H. to comply with a court order requiring him to provide an accounting of the amount of money he has already spent on his legal fees and on his credit card bill.  On September 6, 2019, Judge Toomin granted the request for an emergency court order halting H. and H.&rsquo;s entry of an order temporarily restraining him from entering the Saura Center, a nonsecure adult detention center, and ordering him to surrender his passport.  After a hearing on September 8, 2019 and a hearing scheduled for October 19, 2018 on the same day, Judge Jackson granted the court's order halting the entry and entry of the order prohibiting him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any electronic device, including cell phones, and any other electronic device that may be used to record or record a criminal activity. The order also prohibits the issuance of a cease-and-desist letter or an order requiring a court to issue an order prohibiting the issuance or purchase of any device, and orders the issuance and purchase of a copy of any court order. The court granted the order"
