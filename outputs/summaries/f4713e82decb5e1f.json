  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Devon Delehoy, a South Dakota man charged with kidnapping, assaulting, and raping his girlfriend Kari Vaughn.  According to the SEC's complaint, on June 27, 2017, at approximately 2:00 a.m., the defendant and his girlfriend met at Common Cents in Belle Fourche, Minn., to pay for a carload of groceries. The complaint alleges that, after the two met at the Motel, the defendant allegedly recorded a phone call between the two of them, which was played for the jury.  The complaint further alleges that the recording was not played to the jury because the recording contained statements by Shepherd and Vaughn related to their methamphetamine use.  As alleged in the complaint, the recording did not appear to be a Brady violation because it was a recording of a recording, and the defendant did not use the phone to record the call.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against the defendant.  On March 8, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, charging DelehOY with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rules 206(3) and 206 (4)-8 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, however, the defendants have consented to the entry of judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and imposing civil penalties against each of them. The SEC is continuing its investigation into this matter.   The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the United States Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI Criminal Investigations, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Missouri Secretary of State's Office."
