  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a default judgment against Jayceon Taylor for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, in May 2015, Taylor took contestant Priscilla Rainey on an off-camera date at a suburban sports bar. As alleged in the complaint, during the course of the date, Taylor repeatedly lifted her skirt, grabbed her bare buttocks and vagina, and \u201cjuggled\u201d her breasts in front of a large crowd of onlookers.

The order also prohibits Taylor from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order, and prohibits him from associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The final judgment orders Taylor to pay disgorgement of $2,078, which is equal to the amount of his civil monetary penalties, and orders Rainey to pay $1 million in prejudgment interests.
