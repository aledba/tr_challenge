  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments in favor of parents who have failed to maintain a normal parent-child relationship.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Boise, Idaho, alleges that, from about the time Child was one year old, Grandparents abandoned her.  According to the complaint, the court found that, despite having limited financial means and having significant financial responsibility for Child, the parents failed to provide reasonable support to Child.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, filed on June 22, 2017, the magistrate court terminated the parents\u2019 parental rights on the basis of insufficient evidence to support the termination.  In its Judgment, the Court held that the termination was in the best interest of the children, and that it was in Child\u2019s best interest to terminate the parental rights.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  On June 29, 2017 the court issued its Final Judgment, which permanently enjoins the defendants from violating Section 16-2005 and Rule 16-2007, and orders them to pay civil penalties of $600,000 and $1.5 million, respectively, for each of the foregoing violations.  It also orders the Defendants to pay $1,200,000 in civil penalties and disgorge $1 million in prejudgment interest and a $500,000 civil penalty.  Separately, the SEC announced that it had obtained an emergency court order halting the Defendants' unlawful termination of parental rights, which included the issuance of an order suspending the Defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, and the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California."
