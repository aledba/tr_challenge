  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York yesterday entered a preliminary injunction against Florida Department of Corrections (DDC) and its former Director of Health Services, Carl Reimers, for failing to provide timely and appropriate treatment to a class of inmates with Hepatitis C virus.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Orlando, Florida, DDC and its then-director of health services, Dr. Carl Maier, failed to adequately assess the serious medical needs of the class.  The complaint alleges that DDC failed to provide adequate care to the class of patients who were infected with HCV.  As alleged in the complaint, Dewsnup told Dr. Maier that the only true curative treatment for HCV was a liver transplant.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins DDC from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders DDC to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against Mr. Mascianica, a former DIC, for his role in the DIC's failure to adequately treat HCV-infected inmates.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of Inspector General and the Division of Criminal Justice's Office of Health Education and Advocacy. The litigation will be led by Ms. Scoggins and supervised by Jennifer Chun Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.N. Office of Medical Education, and the Department of Health and Human Services."
