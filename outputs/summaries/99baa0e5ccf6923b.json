  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland today announced charges against a Baltimore man accused of stealing electronics, a home, and a kitchen stove.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore on January 13, 2017, Aaron Bradds was charged with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of this conduct, Bradd's bail was set at $25,000 and he was unable to pay the $50,000 bond.  In a parallel action, the Maryland Attorney General's Office today announced that it has issued a subpoena for a copy of Rule 4-216, which requires the court to determine whether or not to hold a defendant without bail.  On January 19, 2018, the court granted the subpoena and issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the defendant's assets, and ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to be permanently enjoined from violating the securities laws and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar against him. The court also granted the request for a preliminary injunction against further violations of Section 5-216 and Rule 5-3 thereunder, and ordered Bradd to pay an $80,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000, which is equal to the penalty imposed by the court on the other defendants.  Bradd has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating these provisions.  He has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to be restrained and restrained from appearing or practicing before the court as a matter of law.  To comply with the court's order, Mr. Bradd will be required to show cause and consent to the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Michael J. Basinger and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Baltimore Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Maryland Office of the Public Defender, the U. S. Attorney, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Maryland Department of Justice in this matter."
