The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle, Washington, alleges that the Washington State Liquor and Bancorp Board of Directors (WSHB) unlawfully imposed price differentials in the sale of wine and spirits in violation of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the WSHB previously issued price-differentials that were inconsistent with the federal law, and that the Board violated those provisions when it promulgated the new rules.

The court has also granted the SEC a temporary restraining order prohibiting the purchase, sale, or alteration of any liquor, wine, spirits, or liquor-related product, including, without limitation, the issuance of an order requiring the purchase of a copy of the proposed rule. The order also requires the purchase and sale of any wine or spirits product subject to the imposition of a price differential, which the Board determined to be reasonable and capricious. The Order also prohibits the sale or purchase of any alcoholic beverage in the state of Washington, including liquor. The Board has also issued an order suspending the sale, purchase, and alteration of liquor licenses. The Court has also ordered the"
