  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of Hobbs' motion for a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze against Hobbs. Hobbs, who lives in Ohio, sold Jaron Kirkling a used Chevrolet Suburban in September 2012. According to the court's order, Hobbs agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Hobbs to take the stand and testify that he was not at fault in creating the situation giving rise to the affray, nor did he have a bona fide belief that he possessed of a gun, and that he did not violate any duty to retreat or avoid the danger. The order also prohibits Hobbs from participating in the sale of any firearm, and Hobbs has agreed to be permanently barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas of the Chicago Regional Office and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Market Abuse Unit. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Department of Justice, and the Ohio State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
