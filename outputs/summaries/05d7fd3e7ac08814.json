  "summary": "On July 13, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment against three Pennsylvania-based companies for their roles in the Grenfell Tower fire.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, alleges that Arconic, Inc., Arconica Architectural Products, LLC, Saint-Gobain Corporation, and Whirlpool Corporation violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to adequately disclose to the court that the fire was caused by a defective fridge-freezer manufactured and sold by the three companies.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants knew or should have known of the risks of the manufacture of Reynobond PE cladding and its sale for use in the Tower fire, but failed to inform the victims of its dangers.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the three defendants are directly or indirectly liable under Pennsylvania law for the role that RS5000 PIR insulation played in the fire, and that they are liable as a successor for Indesit Company's sale of the Hotpoint fridge freezer involved in the refurbishment of the Tower.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Commission's order, the Arconics consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and officer-and-director and penny stock bars.  On August 29, 2018, the Court entered a judgment ordering the Arconsic defendants to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000 and ordering the defendants to disgorge their allegedly illusory gains with interest, pay civil penalties of $2,500 each, and pay officer and director bars of $250,000.   The judgment also ordered the ArConics to comply with the Rule 12(b)(2) and (3d Cir. 2011) requirements of the Exchange Act, and ordered the company to pay an $80,000 civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Philadelphia Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Office of Inspector General."
