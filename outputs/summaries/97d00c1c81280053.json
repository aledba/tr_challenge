  "summary": "On January 22, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois entered a final judgment against Arthur W. Wiggins Jr., a former mayor of Chicago Heights, Illinois, who, according to the court's order, filed a statement of candidacy and nominating petitions in November 2018 stating that he would not be included on the ballot as a candidate for the office of mayor in the upcoming municipal election.  The court also found that Wiggins failed to include the date of the primary election in his nominating papers.  As alleged in the court order, the petitioner failed to comply with the requirements of section 10-10 of the Municipal Code, which requires candidates to file for a primary election before they are required to appear on the primary ballot.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Wiggins consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal election laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the Illinois Secretary of State's Office today announced criminal charges against Wiggins.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, Wiggins violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(1) thereunder. The court granted the objectors' request for a temporary restraining order and ordered that Wiggins be barred from participating in the consolidated primary election and instead have his name placed directly onto the ballot for the consolidated election. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael A. Stebel and Ruben Reynoso of the Chicago Regional Office, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Michael B. Braunstein. The case is being supervised by Amy C. Welshhans. The examination that led to the discovery of the complaint was conducted in the Office of Inspector General's Analysis and Detection Center with assistance from the Chicago Office of Public Education."
