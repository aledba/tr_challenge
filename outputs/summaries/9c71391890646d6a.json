  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee today entered final judgments in favor of the federal government in a civil injunctive action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, on April 8, 2015, a Union City, Alabama officer unlawfully conducted a warrantless search of a residence without a warrant. The complaint alleges that the officer followed the officer's instructions to check the warrant and found that the warrant had been issued on an incorrect date. The SEC alleges that as a result of this conduct, the officer violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the officer was subsequently arrested and charged with violating Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  In a parallel action, on May 15, 2016, the SEC charged the officer with violating the good-faith exception, which requires a reasonable reliance on evidence obtained from a reasonable search warrant.  According to the SEC's order, the officers violated the good faith exception because they did not follow the officer\u2019s instructions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, both officers consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws and order them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a conduct-based injunction. The court also granted the officer a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security measure, including the issuance of a court order requiring him to surrender his passport or other documents, and ordered him to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  On May 16, 2016 the U. S. District Judge in Jackson issued a final judgment against the officer, ordering him to comply with the court order. The final judgment, which permanently enjoins the officer from future violations of the securities laws, orders him to disgorge his illusory gains with interest, pay civil penalties, and appoint a receiver to oversee the receiver. The order also orders the officer to provide a copy of the warrant to the receiver, which will be used to determine whether to issue an arrest warrant based on the information obtained pursuant to the search warrant, and to provide an accounting of the officers\u2019 actions in the event of an emergency. The officer complied with the order and was arrested without incident. The investigation was conducted by Scott A. McCole and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson, Ms. Burden, and Ms. McGole."
