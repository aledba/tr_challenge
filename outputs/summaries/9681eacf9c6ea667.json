  "summary": "On January 17, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment in favor of Porzecanski, who was diagnosed with systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS) in 2005. According to the court's order, the SCLS diagnosis was so severe that it required the use of an IVIG treatment. The court also found that the drug or biological treatment was not reasonable and necessary, and that a local coverage determination did not cover all of the treatments. In addition, the court also ruled that the treatment should be \"reasonable and necessary\" when used for a \"medically accepted indication.\" The court's final judgment, which is subject to court approval, permanently enjoins the payment of any civil penalty, including disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the payment to be made in the amount of $100,000. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges that the court violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws. The Court's order also orders the appointment of an administrative law judge to determine whether the settlement is reasonable and appropriate.  The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction, and ordered a hearing on the matter on January 24, 2017. The hearing will be conducted by Jennifer Chun Barry and Glenn S. Gordon. The litigation will be led by Ms. Barry and Ms. Basinger. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
