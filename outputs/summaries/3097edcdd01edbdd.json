  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a company that improperly consolidated two worker\u2019s compensation claims.  According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed on May 6, 2011, a jury found that Quest Aircraft, Inc. and its surety, Aerocet, Inc., violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  The Commission also found that, following the 2011 accident, McGivney was entitled to a 2% lower extremity impairment rating for his left knee, with no impairment assigned to his right knee.  As alleged in the complaint, the Commission improperly consolidated the two injury claims and apportioned responsibility for the total disability and medical benefits to Quest.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the Commission, Quest and its Surety consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins the Commission from violating these provisions, and orders Quest to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of any compensation it will receive.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Quest and McGivneys.  On May 19, 2015, the U. S. District Judge in the Northern District of Idaho entered a judgment against Quest, finding that the Commission violated its pre-judgmental order and ordering Quest to comply with the court order.  Quest and the Secretary of State agreed to settle the case by consenting to the issuance of a judgment permanently enjoining Quest from violating the antiligence provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering Quest and McInnis to pay civil penalties equal to $1,000 each, and imposing a $100,000 civil penalty against Quest for violations of the anti-fraud provisions.  A hearing on June 25, 2014, was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. for a hearing that was not conducted by the Commission.  After the hearing, the jury deliberated for approximately two hours before it concluded that Quest should be reimbursed by Quest for 50% of the total and permanent disability benefits, and that the amount due to Quest would be determined as of the date of the hearing by the court upon motion of the court.  Finally, the court granted the Commission\u2018s request for a temporary restraining order against further action by Quest, ordering a hearing in which it would determine whether to proceed with a related administrative proceeding, and ordering the appointment of a receiver to determine the appropriate amount of compensation to be distributed among the parties.    The SEC also issued an order appointing an independent receiver to evaluate the accuracy of the findings"
