  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Michael J. Appellant, Jr., a convicted felon, for his role in a 2016 double-murder of his girlfriend, Constance Nunnally.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Atlanta, Georgia, alleges that, from at least December 2011 through January 2013, Appellants engaged in a series of lies and omissions, including that he had just shot his girlfriend about a year before the fatal shooting, and that when the EMTs arrived at the scene, he asked him if he had shot Cox.  According to the complaint, the answer was no.  Appellantly, as the complaint alleges, because he had been through it before, he had never shot a woman.  As the complaint further alleges, after the trial concluded, the jury was instructed on accident and allowed the lead detective to answer the question.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia today announced criminal charges against Appelant.  On January 24, 2019, the Honorable J.B. J. Thorpe, Jr. of the Atlanta Regional Office issued an order appointing a receiver to oversee the investigation of the case.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the receiver has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.   The court also granted the receiver\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security measure, including in the purchase, sale, or promotion of a security measure.  Additionally, the court granted the widow and son-in-law requests for a preliminary injunction, and ordered the receiver to provide a copy of the final judgment to the receiver.  Finally, the SEC filed a motion for a conduct-based injunction, which is subject to court approval.  To determine whether to proceed with the investigation, the Commission requested that the jury consider the merits of the allegations in the SEC complaint, including whether to impose a penalty of 10 years, 10 months, and 10 years of supervised release, and whether to appoint a receiver for the receiver of the receiver, which would be required by the court to provide timely and accurate information about the receiver"
