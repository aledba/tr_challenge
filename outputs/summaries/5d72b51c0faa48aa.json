  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against Chad Cross, a Texas-based roofing contractor, and his brother, E.G. Helzer, for fraud, fraud by omission, and breach of fiduciary duty.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Dallas, Texas, alleges that, in 2011, Chad Cross and Eric Schmidt agreed to settle a civil action brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Texas Secretary of State's Office by agreeing to settle the SEC's fraud charges against them.  According to the complaint, Cross and Helzer knew that JEH was not complying with its obligations to segregate shingles from its inventory and to pay for the bulk buy.  In addition, the complaint alleges that when CLC made its bulk buy order in March 2012, it did not segregate the bulk buys.  Instead, as CLC alleges, when JEH made its order in June 2012 for anticipated roofing work in McAllen, Texas that it ultimately decided not to take on, it simply did not fill the bulk purchase orders.  As a result, CLC's bulk buy orders were never filled.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 551 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement of $1,078,857, the amount of their ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount owed to them by the court.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.  On February 22, 2019, the SEC filed an emergency action against Schmidt, Schmidt, and Schmidt, charging them with violations of the federal securities laws.  Schmidt and Schmidt are also charged with aiding and abetting each other's violations of Sections 551 and 551(2) of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b2-1 thereunder.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 551, No. 651 (Tex. 2003) and Litigation Alert No. 755 (Texas 2003).  The complaint also charges Schmidt with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 5(d) of\u00c2\u00a0the Exchange Act for violations of Exchange Act Section 5(b) and Rules 5a-5(a) and 5d-8(c).  Schmidt has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from violating Section 5"
