  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against Michael Eric Joaquin and Father and Sons Collectibles, Inc., for breach of contract, common law conversion, and fraud.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against Joaquin.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Michigan, Joaquin told Miller that he would like to sell his gold and silver coins at coin shows, but that he was not going to do so because he \"was in pain all the time, can hardly get in the courtroom,\" and that he \"knew he was going to coin shows when he had previously contracted with Miller.\"  The SEC alleges that, contrary to these statements, Miller failed to comply with the court's orders and failed to provide proof that he had signed the contracts.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Miller.  On May 27, 2019, the court granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction against Miller from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Miller to pay $180,000 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Miller consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest.  Miller also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay civil penalties of $160,000 and $100,000, respectively.  Joaquin has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a permanent injunction against future violations.   The settlement is subject to court approval.
