  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (\"Teva\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed on October 26, 2017 in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, Teva filed a motion for summary judgment against GSK, alleging that it induced doctors to prescribe generic carvedilol to treat CHF.  The complaint further alleges that GSK misrepresented to the jury that the company had developed a method of decreasing the risk of CHF through the use of a \"skinny\" label.  In fact, according to the complaint, the jury found that Teva had not developed this method of treatment and instead relied on Teva's label and marketing materials.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, GSK agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the federal securities laws, orders disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and orders the company to pay civil penalties of $234,110,000 and $1,400,000, respectively.  GSK also agreed to pay a civil penalty of $250,000.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Market Abuse Unit in the New York Regional Office, and is being supervised by Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in this matter."
