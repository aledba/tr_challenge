  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against Steve Combs, a Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources (KDFW) officer, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Frankfort, Kentucky, alleges that, from at least December 2016 through January 2018, Combs violated the federal securities laws by unlawfully handcuffing a Harlan County, Kentucky man who was refusing to leave his son's home.  According to the complaint, the arrest was so egregious that Combs refused to remove or loosen the cuffs and instead left the man in his vehicle.  In a parallel action, on February 13, 2017, the SEC dismissed all of Combs's charges against him for lack of evidence.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Estep consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws, and orders him to pay disgorgement of $1,038,078, plus prejudgment interest of $2,065, and a civil penalty of $100,000.  Combs also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years, and to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  Estep also agreed not to participate in the issuance of any officer-director or director-director bar in the future.  On March 13, 2018, the Court granted a temporary restraining order against Combs and ordered him to surrender his passport.  As set forth in the order, the court will determine whether to impose a permanent injunction, impose a conduct-based injunction, and issue an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5:11-cv-8221 (Jan. 21, 2013).  The Court's order also prohibits Estep from participating in any conduct that constitutes a reasonable arrest or malicious prosecution, and requires him to show that he has reasonable cause to believe that a reasonable person has reasonable reason to believe such an action has occurred.   The court's order, which is subject to court approval, reserves the right to determine whether a defendant is entitled to a hearing or a preliminary injunction, to issue a civil injunctive relief order, to appoint a receiver, to provide an accounting of the defendant's conduct, to conduct a background investigation, to determine the appropriate course of action, to identify any reasonable person who may have violated the charged provisions of the federal laws, to"
