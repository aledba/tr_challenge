  "summary": "On September 29, 2017, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) in an emergency action to halt the issuance of diversity visas.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Los Angeles, California, alleges that the DHS violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint also alleges that, in violation of Section 13(b)(1), the DSH issued a cable advising consular officers to hold unused visa numbers for future processing of visa applications. The court's order, which was entered without prejudice by the court, permanently enjoins DHS from issuing diversity visas after the September 30, 2017 statutory deadline. The order also prohibits the State Department from denying or denying any of the defendants' requests for a preliminary injunction, and from issuing or processing diversity visa applications until the end of the applicable fiscal year.  In addition, the court granted the defendants an asset freeze and an expedited hearing to determine whether to issue a final judgment imposing a permanent injunction against future violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from violating the charged provisions of Sections 13(a)(1)(A) and 13(B)(B)(C). The court also granted the parties' motion for an emergency restraining order, freezing the assets of the Defendants, and ordering the resumption of the litigation.  On October 15, 2017 the court issued an order requiring the DSS to process all of the applicants' visa applications, including those for which the court found the Executive Order to be unlawful. On September 24, 2017 a federal district court in Hawaii granted certiorari in a separate case against DHS in a related action, and on October 24 the same court granted a temporary injunction against the D.C. Attorney General's Office from issuing the diversity visa. The same day, the Honorable Sonia S. Chiong of the Court granted the DOJ's motion for preliminary injunction against issuing the visas, and issued an emergency court order halting the issuance and issuance of the visas. On October 31, 2017 DHS issued a cease-and-desist letter to DHS staff recommending that the court issue an order suspending the suspension of DSH's visa applications in the event of a court finding that the executive order was unlawful. DSH also issued an executive order requiring DSH to process DSH visa applications by September 30.  DSH has agreed to the settlement"
