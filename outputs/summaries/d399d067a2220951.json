  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against a New Jersey resident who sought to recover attorney's fees from a Porter County Airport property owner who had repudiated the purchase agreement.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Porter County, Indiana, on September 14, 2010, Robert Macmahon, a real estate agent based in New Jersey, and his wife, Theresa Iatarola, of New York, raised the issue of whether to grant Song's request to return his earnest money.  The complaint alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, Song violated the antifraud provisions of the agreement by failing to disclose that the property was zoned I-2 Industrial rather than Agricultural, and that he was entitled to recover the earnest money in the amount of $150,000.  On August 12, 2016, the trial court granted Song's motion for summary judgment against the Iatarolas and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $1.5 million.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of Pennsylvania today announced criminal charges against Song arising from the same conduct.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Scott Reitz and Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Mr. Gibson.

Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling them investments by using\u00c2\u00a0the SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify if there are any signs of fraud or a pattern of misstatements or omissions in the SEC filings.  For example, on June 20, 2011, a jury found Song liable for $1 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties of $100,000, and ordered Song to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Song consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently"
