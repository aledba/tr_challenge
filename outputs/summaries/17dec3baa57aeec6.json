  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Illinois today announced charges against a Springfield, Illinois woman for her role in a January 9, 2010, assault that left her with severe burns.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Springfield, Missouri, alleges that J.M. Cannady was the victim of an assault by Lance Hill, who was the father of two children.  According to the complaint, Cannady asked a neighbor to take her to where Hill was living, and she and Hill began smelling grease from the kitchen.  As the complaint alleges, as soon as Hill and Cannady entered the house, they encountered Cannady in the kitchen, throwing grease at each other, and then going outside to the car to search for the woman.  After Cannady confronted Hill about the grease, he allegedly began to beat her in the back of the head with a pot of hot grease, which he then used to smother her.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Cannady, ordering her to pay a civil penalty of $150,000.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders Cannady to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $250,000, $50,000 and $100,000 respectively.  Additionally, the court granted Cannady a temporary restraining order, which prohibits her from associating with any third party, and ordered her to surrender her passport and other personal information in order to obtain an officer-and-director bar.  Cannady also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and to be restrained and restrained from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the public company or by association with any registered broker or broker dealer.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Christopher Laughlin, John Rymas, and Eric Werner of the Chicago Regional Office, with the assistance of the Office of Professional and Risk Analysis, and supervised by Scott Frost, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Mr. Laughlin and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance in this matter of the U."
