  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against a former contractor who was found liable for violations of the federal workers\u2019 compensation law.  The SEC alleges that Christopher Pierce, who was employed as a service technician for Pella Windows & Doors, Inc., violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Denver, Pierce violated Section 8-40-202(2)(b)(i) and Section 9-10 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  In its judgment, the court found that the independent contractor test was not sufficient to determine whether a worker was an employee or an independent contractor, and that Pella was entitled to the right to seek a final judgment on the merits of the case.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Pierce consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  Pella also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $1,038, and to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively, to be determined by the court at a later date.   In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Colorado today announced criminal charges against Pierce.  On September 24, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Pierce, alleging that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) the Securities Act of 1933, Section 9(a)(1) and Rule 9b2-1 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of its Investment Adviser Program.  It also charged Pella with violating Section 10-b of the Exchange Act for his failure to comply with the SEC\u2019s order.
