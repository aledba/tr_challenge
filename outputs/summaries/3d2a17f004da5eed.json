According to the SEC's complaint, filed on May 30, 2002, Majors entered his home, hid inside the closet of the master bedroom, and awaited the Peckhams' return home. As alleged in the complaint, he used a ski mask and gloves to hide his identity and sought to avoid detection.

Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay a civil penalty of five years, and imposes a five-year officer-and-director bar against him.
