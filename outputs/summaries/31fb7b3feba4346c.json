  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan yesterday entered a final judgment against the trustee of a former manufacturing facility in Benton Harbor, Michigan.  The court found that the trustee breached his fiduciary duties with respect to one of the Debtor\u2019s assets and ordered him to pay $104,770.00 in attorney fees and costs and $61,417.50 to the third-party vendor that performed the electronic records searches.  According to the court order, Demorest served five subpoenas on the non-parties, and each sought the production of documents in 36 broad categories, including all communications, computer records and emails.  Demorest and another attorney, Christina McDonald, both of whom represented the subpoenas, consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating Rule 45(d) of the federal securities laws, and requires them to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $4,725.00.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Demorest.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, charges Demorest with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the trustee has agreed to settle the SEC's charges by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the above-mentioned provisions, ordering him to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay civil penalties, and impose a $150,000 civil penalty.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval.
