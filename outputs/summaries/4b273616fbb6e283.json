  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas yesterday entered a final judgment against a Tyler, Texas man who was convicted of criminally negligent homicide for causing the death of his girlfriend.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, alleges that James A. Appellant, a convicted felon who was sentenced to 10 years of probation for the same conduct in May 2016, caused Haile Beasley's death by driving into an oncoming car.  According to the complaint, after Beasley was hit by a car on May 14, 2016, the defendant returned to The Cascades Country Club to drink with friends and family members, causing Beasley to lose her life instantly.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 17(a)(1) and 17(b)(3) of Securities Act of 1933 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.

In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges.  On May 21, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the defendants to return to the scene of the accident and to pay a civil penalty of $150,000, which is equal to the amount of their prison time.   The court also granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against further violations of the charged sections of the securities laws and ordered a conduct-based injunction prohibiting them from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the issuance of any civil injunctive relief, including an officer-and-director bar, a penny stock bar, and an officer and director bar.  Judge McCole also issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221.  Separately, the SEC filed an emergency action in the case of Tyrell B. Williams, Jr., who was also convicted of the same criminal conduct.  Williams agreed to a permanent injunction prohibiting him from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and agreed to pay $75,000 in disgorg"
