  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Edward G. McDonough, the former Democratic Commissioner of the Rensselaer County Board of Elections, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Troy, New York, alleges that, during the 2009 municipal primary election, several individuals forged signatures and provided false information on absentee ballot applications and absentee ballots in order to affect the outcome of that primary election.  According to the complaint, the defendants then used the fabricated evidence to frame Mcdonough for the crimes by, among other things, fabricating evidence, offering false testimony, and using faulty DNA methods for analyzing materials used in processing the ballot applications.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Smith, as a prosecutor, was entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity based on his role as a defendant in the malicious prosecution claim.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, the false prosecution claim was based on the actions of Smith, a Special District Attorney, and McDonogh, a District Attorney who handled the investigation and potential prosecution.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the Complaint or the facts of the case, the court has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendants from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders them to pay disgorgement of $1,078.95 plus prejudgment interest of $2,077.95 and a civil penalty of $10,000. The court also granted the defendants the right to reapply after three years of being sentenced following a hearing in which they agreed to be permanently enjoined from future violations of the anti-fraud provision of the securities laws.  On May 2, 2018, the Honorable Rebecca M. Welshhans of the U.N. Office of Justice and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering the defendants to surrender their allegedly forged documents in the event of a court order or a judgment in their favor.  A hearing scheduled for June 5, 2018 is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the New York State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
