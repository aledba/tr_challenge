  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a former Caddo Parish Sheriff who was convicted of molesting a juvenile under the age of 13.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, Allen Richard Roth Jr. was convicted on August 15, 2006, and sentenced to 30 years to life imprisonment.  The SEC alleges that Roth began molesting the victim in the first grade and continued molesting her throughout his adult life.  As alleged in the complaint, Roth used his position as an uncle and caretaker to molest her, beginning at a very young age and continuing for several years until she was at or near age 14.  Roth also allegedly engaged in \"hand-to-genital\" contact with H.M., which occurred in the living room and in Roth's office at the time of the alleged molestation.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Orleans today announced criminal charges against Roth.  On August 19, 2016, the court granted Roth's request for a second assignment of error and imposed a penalty of 30 years at a time, with the first 25 years to be served without benefits.  After a hearing on July 6, 2017, the trial court ruled that Roth violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered Roth to pay a civil penalty of $5,000 and/or $10,000, respectively.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Roth agreed to a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, imposes a $25,000 civil penalty, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities for a period of five years.  He also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and to be restrained and restrained from associating with any person who is not a member of the public with securities laws violations.  Additionally, Roth consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(a) of The Securities Act of 1933, and ordering him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the amount of $2,965, which is equal to the penalty imposed by the court.   The court also granted Roth a temporary restraining order prohibiting him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney and from appearing before the court as a public figure. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Jennifer R. Lee, Mark V. Pyszka, and Eric R. Werner of the New Orleans Regional Office."
