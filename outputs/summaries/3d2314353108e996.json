  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against a convicted felon for failing to stop and give information to an officer in connection with a criminal case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Houston, Texas, alleges that Nicholas Jackson failed to comply with a court order requiring him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty.  According to the complaint, Jackson was driving recklessly while Simmons followed him, and was surprised when the officer said, \u201care you going to stop?\u201d  The complaint further alleges that Jackson did not respond to the officer's question about whether he had been involved in an accident.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Jackson violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the court order required him to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced criminal charges against Jackson.  On October 11, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the United States Court of Criminal Appeals in Houston issued a temporary restraining order and issued an order suspending Jackson from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the SEC, Jackson has consented to a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  Jackson has agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 517 (Aug. 30, 2018).  The case was supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Office of Inspector General in this matter."
