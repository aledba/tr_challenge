  "summary": "On September 18, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against Ford Motor Company (\"Ford\") for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, alleges that Ford violated the federal securities laws by failing to show that it had specific jurisdiction over its products liability claims in South Carolina.  According to the complaint, the SEC alleges that, contrary to Ford's representations, the defendants' claims arise from the extent and pervasiveness of Ford's contacts with other forums.  For example, the complaint alleges that a manufacturing or design defect in the front passenger seat of a 2014 Ford Edge caused Stanley to travel into the back passenger compartment and strike Marjorie, injuring them both.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Ford has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the securities laws and orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of any civil penalty it will impose.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California today announced criminal charges against Ford.  On September 19, 2020, the court granted Ford's motion for a temporary restraining order and entered an order freezing the assets of the company and imposing a $1.2 million civil penalty.   The court's order freezes Ford's assets and orders the company to pay a $500,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas of the Philadelphia Regional Office and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u00c2\u00a0 The litigation will be led by John M. Birkenheier and Ms. Mascianica."
