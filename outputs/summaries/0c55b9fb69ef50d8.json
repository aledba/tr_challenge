  "summary": "On October 11, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Connecticut, alleges that, in 2012, Alfredo Serrano, a registered state senator, and Leeta Reed, a former state treasurer, made illegal contributions to a campaign that raised more than $80,000 from at least 300 individuals residing in whole or in part in the candidate's district. According to the complaint, Serrano and Reed agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint. The complaint also alleges that Serrano waived his instructional challenge and, in a parallel action, agreed to be permanently enjoined from violating Section 9-622 of the Exchange Act. The court also ordered Serrano to pay a civil penalty of $10,000.  In its judgment, the court ruled that the amount of the alleged illegal contributions was insufficient to determine whether the defendant acted with intent to violate the federal securities laws, and that the penalty should be determined by the court at a later date.  On October 13, 2016, the Court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered the SEC to conduct an examination of the materials in its possession. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Connecticut Department of Justice, and the Connecticut State Corporation Commission in this matter."
