  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Louisiana today announced criminal charges against a Shreveport man for his role in an attempted armed robbery that went awry.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Bossier City, Louisiana, alleges that, on July 27, 2014, the defendant, Kinoy Damon Singleton, entered into a guilty plea without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. Singleton was convicted as a second-degree murderer in 2014 and sentenced to 40 years in prison. The SEC alleges that Singleton violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he aided and abetted Singleton's violations of Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of Exchange Act Rule 17a-3 thereunder. In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Central District of New York today entered a final judgment against Singleton that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains. The court also ordered Singleton to pay a $1,000 civil penalty.  On June 1, 2017, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  In its order, the court entered a temporary restraining order, which prohibits Singleton from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in connection with the alleged conduct of the alleged perpetrators. The order also requires Singleton and his co-defendant to provide depositions and testimony in the criminal case against them.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-0070 (La. 10/11/11).  In a related matter, the Court granted a preliminary injunction on June 13, 2017.  A hearing on August 31, 2016, was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. for Singleton. The hearing was adjourned for a later date to allow the defendant to present his own testimony at a separate trial. The jury deliberated for two hours before finding Singleton liable for the alleged misconduct. The final judgment, which was entered without prejudice to the defendant's motion to sever his trial, orders Singleton guilty of violating Section 10-b of the Exchange Act and ordered him liable for a total of five felony counts, including one count of aiding and abetting Taylor's violation of Section 15(b)(2) and Rule 15a-1. The trial court granted the defendant a hearing"
