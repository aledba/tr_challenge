  "summary": "On December 21, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania entered a final judgment in favor of the Board of Auditors of McKean Township, Pennsylvania, finding that it improperly appointed an independent and neutral auditor to determine the compensation and benefits of the Township's employees.  According to the court's order, on January 4, 2017, the board of auditors appointed Brian P. Cooper, Janice T. Dennis, and Ronald T. Bole to review the finances of a Second Class Township in Pennsylvania.  The court found that the auditors' decisions were arbitrary, capricious, and inconsistent with the statutory duties of the elected board.  In addition, the court ruled that the auditor should have believed and afforded greater evidentiary weight to their testimony, and that the trial court should have relied on the testimony of the other auditors.  As alleged in the court order, Cooper, Dennis, Bole, and Bole violated the antifraud provisions of Section 606(a) of the Pennsylvania State Auditor Code, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Cooper and Dennis consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoins them from violating the above-mentioned provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their salaries.  Cooper also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public school for five years, and to pay a civil penalty equal to his or her salary.  Bole agreed to a settlement where he will be permanently enjoined from future securities law violations.  Citing the findings of the court, Cooper agreed to settle the matter by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and ordering him to pay an $80,000 civil penalty.  Ditto for Bole and Dennis, who agreed to settlements that are subject to court approval.  A final judgment ordering Cooper to disgorge his ill-gotten gains and pay a penalty of $20,000 is pending final approval by the court.  Finally, the final judgments order Cooper to pay $14,000.  On January 2, 2019, the Pennsylvania Secretary of State's Office issued an order appointing an independent auditor to review finances of Second Class Townships throughout the Commonwealth.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas and Glenn S. Gordon of the Philadelphia Regional Office, with assistance from Joseph Szymanowski of the Office of Economic and Risk Analysis, and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. "
