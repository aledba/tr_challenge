  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas today entered a final judgment against the Town of Shady Shores for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Texas Open Meetings Act and Rule 5b-5 thereunder.  According to the court's order, on February 27, 2014, the Town filed a no-evidence motion for summary judgment in a civil action brought by the Texas Attorney General's Office alleging that Sarah Swanson was wrongfully terminated in retaliation for refusing to destroy a Town investment committee recording after she refused to do so.  The court also found that Swanson had not demonstrated a waiver of governmental immunity as to her claims under the federal securities laws, and that she was not required to file a separate petition for review.  In its judgment, the court found that the Town was entitled to governmental immunity on the basis of that waiver, but did not require the Town to show that it had a reasonable basis for a claim for relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court of appeals' judgment, Swanson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations, and orders her to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and an attorney's fee.  Swanson also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company and from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities in the public company or by participating in any offering of securities in connection with the sale or issuance of any security or other security, including the right to reapply after five years of service.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. McCole granted the Town's request for a temporary restraining order, an order requiring the return of certain county funds allegedly expended in violation of the Local Government Contract Claims Act, and a civil injunctive relief order.  McCole also granted the town's motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the civil injunctions, ordered a hearing on the matter, and issued an order appointing a receiver for the receiver of the receiver.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Eric R. Werner and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the Texas Secretary of State's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Department of Banking and Securities and Exchange Commission."
