  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Maryland today entered a consent judgment against Latashia Pettiford, a Baltimore City resident, for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Baltimore City on November 19, 2018, Pettifand raised a rent escrow claim against Next Generation Trust Service, LLC, a Maryland-based real estate development company, alleging that the company had failed to pay rent for five months (June through October 2018) and seeking repossession of the property.  The complaint alleges that, in reality, the defendants had not paid rent for the five months and owed $5,339.64 in late fees.  In addition, as alleged in the complaint, the tenants had not had working heat in the property since February and did not have sufficient heat to make rent payments.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Complaint, the Defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay a civil penalty of $4,799.64.   The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-17-2018.  On November 21, 2018 the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, charging them with violations of Sections 5(a)(1) and 5(c) and (3).  The SEC's Complaint charges the defendants with violating Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the Defendants.  It also charges the Defendants with violating Sections 9(a), 10(c), and 13(b)(2) of Exchange Act Rules 10b2-1 and 13a-14 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting the Defendants' violations of Section 15(a).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Maryland today announced criminal charges against both defendants.  To learn more about rent escrows, see Rules 9a-13, 10b6-1, 10a-11, and 12b20-1.  A hearing for the defendants is scheduled for January 1, 2019, and the SEC appreciates the assistance of the Maryland Office of Inspections and Examinations, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Baltimore Office of Inspector General, the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development and the Baltimore Police Department."
