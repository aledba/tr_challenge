  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Woodbury, a former employee of HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc., that permanently enjoins him from violating the company's noncompete and nondisclosure provisions.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Hampshire, alleges that Woodbury violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  In its complaint, HCC alleges that, shortly after Woodbury resigned from HCC, Woodbury began soliciting HCC's clients for a second round of hole-in-one promotions.  According to the complaint, after learning of Woodbury's plans to join HCC as an insurance agent, he contacted Woodbury and informed him that he would need to sign a new non-compete agreement.  Woodbury agreed, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of these provisions, ordering him to pay a civil penalty of $20,000, and ordering Woodbury to disgorge his ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest of $2,500.   The judgment also prohibits Woodbury from serving as an officer, director, or officer of a public company, and from participating in any offering of any type of insurance, including securities, in the issuance of a civil injunctive relief order.  Without admitting to the allegations in the court's order, the defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to permanent injunctions, disgorgement of $12,000 plus prejudgment interests, and to pay civil penalties of $5,000 each.  Additionally, the settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Boston Regional Office and supervised by Eric Werner of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The litigation will be led by Mr. Werner and Ms. Werner. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office, and the Connecticut Department of Insurance in this matter."
