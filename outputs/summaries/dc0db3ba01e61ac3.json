  "summary": "The Missouri Secretary of State's Office today announced that Spire Missouri, Inc. and its subsidiary, Laclede Gas Co., have agreed to settle a civil action brought by the Public Service Commission against them.  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri, alleges that, on June 7, 2018, Spire filed an application and petition with the Commission to change its Infrastructure System Replacement Surcharges (ISRS) in its East and West service territories.  According to the complaint, the Commission's order required Spire to recover costs incurred to replace cast iron and bare steel mains and service lines that were worn out or deteriorated.  Spire's request for an ISRS surcharge was approved by the Commission on August 6, 2018.  On August 16, 2018 the Commission issued a report and order that stated that, in its opinion, that the Commission had found that most of the cast iron, steel, and plastic pipes in Spire\u2019s service territory were worn and deteriorated and that the cost of replacing those pipes would be recovered through an increase to the ISRS revenue.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the Commission&rsquo;s opinion, SpIRE agreed to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders it to pay a civil penalty of $4,100,000.  In a parallel action, the Missouri Department of Commerce today announced criminal charges against Spire.  It also announced that it has filed a civil injunctive action against the company for violating the anti-ratemaking provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 17(a)(1) and (3) the reporting provisions of Sections 393.1009(5)(a) and 5(c) thereunder of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\") and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.   The complaint also charges Spire with violations of Section 5 of the Exchange Act and Rule 5b2-1 thereunder and seeks disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  Finally, the complaint seeks an order requiring the company to pay civil penalties in the amount of $2,607,610, $5,411,793, and a $1,000,000 officer and director bar.
