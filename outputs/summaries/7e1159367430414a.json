  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas on June 27, 2018 entered a final judgment against Monica Rodriguez, the mother of a Texas child who was charged with endangering the safety and well-being of two of her children.  The court found that Monica violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordered her to comply with the court order.  According to the court's order, Monica violated Section 161.001(b)(1)(E) and Section 206(1)(B)(2)(A) and Rules 206(2)(B) and 206(3)(B)-8 thereunder.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Monica.  On May 24, 2018, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order and ordered Monica to return the children to their mother.  Monica agreed to the entry of the final judgment without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, and agreed to a permanent injunction, to be followed by a conduct-based injunction, and to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Fort Worth Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Texas Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
