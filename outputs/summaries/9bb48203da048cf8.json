  "summary": "On June 21, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Company (PIIC) in a civil action brought by USA Gymnastics, the national governing body for gymnastics.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Colorado Springs, Colorado, alleges that PIIC violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  According to the complaint, PIIC was not in control of USOC's litigation defense when it obtained the insurance policies.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the insurance company misrepresented to the court that the policies would never have been issued but for the misrepresentations of the insured.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders PIIC to pay a $130,445.00 premium paid for policy number PHPK1330247, and $27,760.00 to cover policy number PHUB498238. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On June 14, 2020, the court granted PIIC's request for a preliminary injunction against future violations and ordered the company to return the insurance policy to PIIC, which it obtained as part of a settlement with the SEC.  PIIC has agreed to settle the case by consenting to a temporary injunction and to pay $150,000 in civil penalties, which will be determined by the court upon motion by the parties at a later date. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Colorado Office of Insurance Regulation, and the Colorado Division of Enforcement in this matter.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01984 (Feb. 14, 2008).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant the United States Olympic Committee's (USOC) obligations to recognize and stop abuse within both the governance, management and participation in Olympic sports through the NGBs and its obligations to protect the more than three million NGB members and tens of thousands of NGB staff and volunteers participating in the sports represented by PIIC. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov."
