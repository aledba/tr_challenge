  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against St. John Medical Center, Inc., a now-defunct Oklahoma medical center, and three radiologists in connection with a medical malpractice case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Norman, Oklahoma, on December 26, 2009, Dr. Michael J. Connor, a board certified radiologist, and John F. Mize, an emergency room physician, reviewed radiologic studies performed on Sanders and concluded that the failure to correctly diagnose Sanders' head and neck caused her permanent injuries.  The complaint alleges that Dr. Connor was not qualified to testify as an expert because he was not trained as a radiologist and was not authorized to provide medical care on behalf of the hospital.  Instead, the complaint alleges, he was the only radiologist who provided treatment to Sanders at the hospital, and he did not know or should have known that the hospital had not breached the standard of care for radiologists when they failed to detect Sanders' tumor.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and injunctive relief.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order and ordering the destruction of evidence in the case. The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of the Inspector General and the Division of Health and Human Services. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans."
