  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida yesterday entered a final judgment against Matthew Munksgard, a Florida resident charged with defrauding an FDIC-insured bank by making false statements in connection with a loan application.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, from 2013 to 2014, Munksgarden, a resident of Lake Worth, Florida, forged another person\u2019s name to a surveying contract that he submitted to a bank in order to obtain financing for his land-surveying business.  The complaint alleges that, as alleged in the complaint, the government failed to show beyond a reasonable doubt that Drummond Community Bank was FDIC insured.  In addition, the complaint further alleges that the bank failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove that the purported FDIC insurance covered by the FDIC was present at the time of the alleged bank fraud.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Munkgarden consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  Finally, the court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the bank, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 1028A-1014, July 17, 2018.  On August 2, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Burt of the U. S. District court for the Northern District of Mississippi entered a judgment against Munk, permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, and ordering a conduct-based injunction against him from further violating the charged provisions of the securities laws.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by David C. Hannan and supervised by Marc Blau of the Atlanta Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Florida Office of Inspector General, and the Florida Department of Banking and Securities."
