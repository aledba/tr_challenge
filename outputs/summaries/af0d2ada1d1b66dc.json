The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, between March 12, 2013, and May 31, 2016, Red Hook Windows, LLC (\"BEAW\"), formerly known as Bieber European Architectural Windows & Storefronts NY (\"Bieber European\"), violated the registration provisions of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, the defendants failed to demonstrate that they acted as the alter egos of BEAW and were not involved in the marketing, selling, or installing of windows or doors.

The complaint also charged the defendants with violating Section 17-a-3 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Rules 10b-5, 13a-11, and 13b-13 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and an officer-and-director bar against Defendants.
