  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia today entered a final judgment in favor of a West Virginia man who was convicted of drug and firearms charges and sentenced to a 120-month prison term.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Kanawha County, West Virginia, alleges that on June 28, 2016, a federal grand jury in Charleston returned a six-count indictment against Walker for possession of a.38-caliber Rossi handgun. The indictment alleged that Walker violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint alleges that Walker failed to show that the court improperly relied on the evidence presented to the jury in its decision to reject his plea agreement. The court also ruled that Walker had a reasonable chance of recovering the stolen firearm, which he claimed he had used to make the purchase of the gun. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of W.Va. today announced criminal charges against Walker. The SEC previously charged Walker with a felony for his role in a drug ring that included possession of an unregistered firearm. Walker pleaded guilty without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint and was sentenced to 120 months in prison. In his sentencing memorandum, filed on December 15, 2017, the court agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins Walker from future violations of the federal securities laws and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $150,000. Walker also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the SEC instituted a parallel criminal proceeding against Walker, which was conducted by a probation officer and supervised by a federal judge. The litigation will be led by J.A. Birkenheier. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter and Glenn S. Gordon of the SEC's Atlanta Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Kentucky Department of Criminal Justice, and the Kentucky State Corporation Commission in this matter."
