  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Missouri man who was convicted of third-degree assault in violation of the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Missouri, Curtis Johnson was found guilty by a jury of being a felon in possession of a firearm and sentenced to ten years in prison.  The complaint alleges that Johnson had only two prior felony convictions that qualified as violent felonies under the federal criminal laws, and that Johnson was not convicted of a violent felony for the purposes of the federal securities laws.  Johnson also was found liable for a felony conviction for attempted second-degree domestic violence.  In its judgment, the court found that Johnson violated the federal registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a)(2)(B) and that he was properly sentenced under those provisions.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Johnson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of 10 years and a $10,000,000 civil penalty, and bars him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in the United States, or any other federal financial institution.  On November 13, 2018, the Honorable Paul G. Sansone of the Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order against Johnson, ordering him to surrender his passport and return to Missouri, and imposing a $75,000 penalty against him.  To learn more about the SEC\u2019s complaint, see Press Release No. 17-5753 (January 24, 2019).
