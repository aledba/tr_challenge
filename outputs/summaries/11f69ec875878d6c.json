  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Ohio today announced criminal charges against Lakysha Sager for interference with custody.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Sager violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  In its complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio, Sager alleges that she violated Section 2919.23(A)(1) and Section 2920.23 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  Sager also alleges that as a result of her conduct, she was not eligible to have the records of her convictions sealed.  According to the complaint, the SEC's allegations were false and misleading, and Sager consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $50,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint or in the court's order, the defendant consented and agreed to the issuance of a second judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the charged sections of the securities laws, ordering him to pay $10 million in restitution, and appointing a receiver to oversee the receivership of the stolen children.  Finally, the court granted Sager's request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits her from associating with any person who is a victim of an interfering-with-custody offense with a person who has been charged with a felony or a federal felony, and ordered Sager to surrender her passport and other documents related to the alleged conduct.  On May 13, 2017, a jury returned guilty verdicts against Sager on both counts on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct and insufficiency of evidence, and sentenced her to a 30-day jail term and a lengthy period of \"probation.\"  In a parallel action, the Ohio Secretary of State's Office today announced that it has issued an order suspending Sager from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney, and ordering her to submit to the SEC a copy of the final judgment, which is subject to approval by the court upon motion of the SEC.  A hearing scheduled for June 21, 2018, is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  For further information, see State v. Tekulve, 188 Ohio St.3d 178, 2002-Ohio-4009, 772 N.E.2d 1172"
