  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a Montana company and its sole member in a maritime insurance case.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 2014, Galilea, LLC and Chris Kittler submitted to Pantaenius America Ltd. an online request for an insurance quote for a sixty-foot yacht. According to the complaint, the company's insurance policy, which is subject to federal preemption, was not subject to the arbitration provision of the federal maritime law. The complaint further alleges that Galilea and the Underwriters agreed to an arbitration provision that was not enforceable under the federal law, and that, instead, it was a choice-of-law provision. The SEC alleges that this arbitration provision violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the broker-dealer registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933. Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's Complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the federal securities laws, require them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and impose civil penalties. The settlements are subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Montana today announced criminal charges against Galilea.  On May 24, 2019, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against the defendants, charging them with violations of the above-mentioned provisions of the Federal Arbitration Rules. The defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a judgment that enjoins them from future violations of these provisions, imposes a civil penalty of $100,000, and requires Galilea to pay a $75,000 civil penalty. The settlement is pending final approval by the court.  Separately, a federal district court in Montana issued an order requiring the defendants to comply with court orders barring them from participating in any arbitration proceeding. The court's order also prohibits the defendants from imposing any monetary penalty or imposing any civil penalty on the parties.  A parallel administrative proceeding was instituted by the United Kingdom Attorney General, the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the British Columbia Securities Commission, the Canadian Securities Inspection Service and the Canadian Financial Conduct Authority. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The litigation will be led by Mr. Gibson, Ms. Gibson and Mr."
