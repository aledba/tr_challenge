  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against the Town Board of Shelter Island for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges that, from April 21, 2017 to July 1, 2017, the City and County of San Francisco entered into a temporary restraining order against certain vacation rental properties that were not subject to the mandatory registration requirements of the federal rental laws.  According to the complaint, Travis-Messer, who lives in the same permanent and principal Shelter Island home as Weisenberg, failed to comply with the required registration requirements for vacation rentals.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Travis Messer has consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating these provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $750, not to exceed $2,500.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending the suspension of the vacation rental registration provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of its website, and ordering him to provide an accounting of the number of vacation rentals that he has rented out to his or her family members.  On July 2, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against Travis- Messer.   The court's order also ordered Travis Messler to pay $1,500 in disgorging and prejudgment interests, and to pay civil penalties of $250,000 and $500,000, respectively. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Jennifer Lederman and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter in the New York Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency."
