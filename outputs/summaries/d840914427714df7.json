  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against a nursing home employee accused of lying to her employer about her severe back pain.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that on May 12, 2014, an administrative law judge incorrectly evaluated her treating physician\u2019s opinion and her credibility.  According to the complaint, Dr. Terry Horton, a resident of Oklahoma City, had previously worked as a medical case manager at a medical center and was laid off for financial reasons. The complaint alleges that Ms. Praytor was suffering from severe, debilitating back pain and arthritis in her right foot, and that she was being treated by a pain specialist at the time Dr. Horton issued his opinion, which he deemed \"unreasonably restrictive\" and \"not fully credible.\"  The complaint further alleges that the same day that Horton issued the opinion, he provided x-rays that corroborated her claims of severe pain, and he instructed her to use an electric shopping cart to buy groceries, limited her shopping to thirty minutes, no longer attended social events, and had difficulty bathing and dressing.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Horton consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a related administrative proceeding, the SEC charged a former medical center employee with lying to the SEC about her receipt of unemployment benefits during the time she initially claimed to be disabled. The SEC charged the former employee with violating Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Section 10-b) and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder.    In its complaint, the complaint charges Horton with violating Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and seeks permanent injunctions, civil penalties, and penny stock bars against him.  It also seeks a conduct-based injunction against future violations of Section 10 of the Exchange Act and Rule 12b-20, and a penny stock bar against him from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security deposit in connection with the issuance of any such security deposit. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John R. Rymas of the Fort Worth Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by Jennifer A. Barry. The litigation will be led by Mr. Barry and Ms."
