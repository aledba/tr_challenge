  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Montana today entered final judgments against Mustang Ranches Association, Inc., a Montana-based registered representative, and its principal, Tim Beardsley, in a civil injunctive action.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Montana, alleges that, in 1973, Mustang Ridge Ranch, Inc. (\"Mustang Ridge\"), a limited partnership, filed an unreviewed subdivision plat in which it claimed that it had the right to place and maintain a 60-foot-wide roadway easement over lots located along the southern edge of the subdivision.  According to the complaint, the plat, which was filed in the District Court, stated that, regardless of their easement rights, the Mustang Ridge lot owner had no right to remove a gate across the road to prevent unauthorized access by other subdivision lot owners.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the complaint further alleged that the property owner was liable for property damage resulting from a self-help removal and destruction of the gate.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,000,000.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the Denver Regional Office, and the litigation will be led by Mr. Mularoni and Ms. O'Keefe.
