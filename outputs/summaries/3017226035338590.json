  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky today entered a final judgment against Kentucky Utilities Co. (KU) for violating the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint alleges that KU violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, filed in federal court in Kentucky on January 27, 2017, KU failed to comply with certain of the requirements of the federal law, including that the Commission on Environmental Quality (CWA) requires that all materials be collected and disposed of in a manner consistent with the CWA.  KU also failed to adequately monitor the groundwater and surface water quality at the site.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against KU.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants agreed to the entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them from future violations of the charged provisions, ordering KU to pay a civil penalty of $25,000, and ordering the Commission to issue an order appointing a receiver to oversee the collection, disposal, and disposal of CWA materials.  Additionally, the Commission issued an order suspending KU's registration with the SEC, freezing the company's assets, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.   The Commission's order also prohibits KU from violating the reporting, reporting, or reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"), and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder, and from issuing or selling any security or other security advisory to a public company or individual.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-1362 (January 20, 2017).  The Complaint also seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  Finally, the complaint seeks a temporary restraining order, an injunction, and an officer-and-director bar.  On May 5, 2018, the SEC filed a complaint in the U.K. District court for the Eastern District of Michigan alleging that, in violation of the Commission's Rules of Practice (RDAP), KU has violated Section 10 of the Exchange Act, and that it has failed to provide reasonable explanation for why it has not acted aggressively enough to remediate the issues raised in the complaint.  Further, the Complaint charges KU with violating Section 17(a)(1) and Rule 17a-3, and seeks a preliminary injunction against future violations"
