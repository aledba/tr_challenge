  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Rasaan Price for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 5 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1940.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago on January 1, 2016 and unsealed on January 2, 2016, Rasaans was charged as an adult with first-degree murder and sentenced to a minimum of 15 years of incarceration.  The complaint alleges that, as a result of his failure to comply with the court's order, he was sent to juvenile court for a mandatory transfer from 15 to 16 years of age.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained an emergency court order halting the automatic transfer.  On January 3, 2017, the court granted a temporary restraining order and issued an order temporarily suspending the mandatory transfer, ordering the court to determine whether to issue an order imposing a preliminary injunction or a permanent injunction, and ordering the issuance of a court order requiring a hearing on the matter.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders them to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against them from serving as an officer or director of a public company.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Pyszka and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Department of Justice, and the Illinois Attorney General's Office. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Criminal Investigations has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0SEC's investor.gov website to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the SEC filed a complaint in federal district court in New York, alleging that a defendant with a prior felony conviction had a history of misconduct and that he had been falsely convicted of a felony. The complaint further alleges that the defendant had not yet been sentenced when the amendment to section 5-130 took effect, and that his trial counsel had failed to timely file a written motion for a hearing before the court appointed a receiver to determine if the sentence should be commuted to adult"
