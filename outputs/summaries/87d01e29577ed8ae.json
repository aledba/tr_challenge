  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was indicted on multiple counts of felony murder and attempted aggravated felony murder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, in 2011, a defendant approached a victim who was sitting in a car and asked him for his wallet. As alleged in the complaint, the victim refused to give the defendant his wallet, and the defendant then asked the victim to get out of the car and drive the short distance to his home. The complaint further alleges that the defendant had attempted to commit a first-degree robbery and attempted second-degree murder, and that the victim had engaged in a felony robbery.  According to the complaint filed in the SEC's New York office, the defendants had committed a series of felony murders, including first- and attempted first- degree robbery. The SEC alleges that defendants who were convicted and sentenced to prison for those crimes did not have sufficient evidence to prove the element of aggravation in the felony murder count.  In its judgment, the court found that the defendants violated the antifraud provisions of Section 161.067(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The court also found that defendants with prior felony convictions could not merge the charges under the same federal statutes.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  To learn more about how to spot a pattern of misconduct in the criminal justice system, see Criminal Justice Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (2014). The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the New York Police Department, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the United States Attorney's Office for New York and the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the U.
