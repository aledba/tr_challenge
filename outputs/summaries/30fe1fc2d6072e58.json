  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered final judgments in favor of The Game Place, L.L.C., a real-estate partnership, and its guarantor, Carl D. Silver, III, in a civil action brought by the Virginia Department of Commerce.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleges that, from at least 2000 through 2014, the Virginia Secretary of State and Attorney General's Office issued an order requiring the use of a seal in deeds of conveyance.  According to the complaint, the seal requirement, which is required by the federal securities laws, was not present in the 15-year lease.  In addition, the complaint alleges that the lease required the seal to be signed by a person so signing and acknowledging the same as the seal.  As alleged in the SEC complaint, however, that the seal was void because it did not comply with the common-law seal requirements.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the common law seal requirements and ordering them to pay $68,610.44 in unpaid rent, $17,152.61 in attorney fees, and a civil penalty of $20,000.  Finally, the court issued a final judgment ordering the defendants to disgorge their ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and to pay civil penalties in the amount of $100,000, $30,000 in disgorgement, and $7,500 in interest.   The court's order also ordered that the defendants pay $1,100 in civil penalties and a $500,000 civil penalty, and that they will be barred from serving as officers or directors of a public company for a period of five years. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation was conducted by John B. Minor, Robert T. Devlin, and Richard A. Lord of the Virginia Office of the Attorney General, and supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The litigation will be led by William Waller Hening and Mr. Hening. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Virginia State Corporation Commission in this matter."
