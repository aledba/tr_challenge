  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington today entered a final judgment against Grant County Auditor Michele Jaderlund in an election fraud case.  The court entered the final judgment on the merits of the case, which is subject to court approval.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Seattle on February 14, 2017, the Grant County auditor failed to timely file a notice of an election for which she was not certified as a registered voter. The court found that the auditor violated the antifraud provisions of the federal election laws and ordered her to send a letter and a correction form to each of the uncalled voters. The complaint also alleges that the Auditor did not timely respond to the letter or to the correction form.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the auditor for his or her role in the alleged misconduct.  On March 8, the court granted the court's motion for a preliminary injunction and ordered the auditor to return a copy of the certified election result to the court. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Korsmo and Graham Loomis of the Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Justice in this matter.  For further information, see Press Release No. 17-cv-01-2017."
