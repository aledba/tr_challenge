  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Randall H. Broussard, a Louisiana man who was charged with orchestrating the breakup of his wife's marriage.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, from October 2013 through January 2014, Randall H., a husband and father of four, and his wife, Linda Waggoner Broushard (Linda), were married on August 8, 2008. The complaint alleges that Randall and Linda split up on October 20, 2013, shortly after Randall moved out of their home and began renovating the home. The SEC alleges that Linda and Randall began dating as early as 2015, but Randall never moved his wife into her home.  The complaint further alleges that on the night of October 20 2013, Randall left the home and went and picked up her boss, whom he met at the farm, and brought her to the \"house\" where he and Linda spent most of the evening together.  As alleged in the complaint, Randall's conduct alone was the proximate cause of the separation of the parties and Randall was solely responsible for the breakup.  In a parallel action, on February 20, 2018, the SEC charged Randall with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and charged Linda with aiding and abetting Randall's violations of Section 13(a) of Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, orders him to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and imposes a civil penalty of $1,000,000. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-11-14.
