  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2012.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, alleges that defendant Ronnie Eugene Appellant violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's order, filed on October 20, 2012, Appellants, then a resident of the Oklahoma City suburb of Enid, told a jury that he had been recruited by fellow members of the 107 Hoover Crips street gang to find Brittany Dillard and kill her.  He also allegedly told the jury that the group was going to \"handle it on the streets\" and that the \"girl\" was getting up or reaching for something.  As alleged in the complaint, the jury was told that the defendants were going to kill the decedent, but the jury could not determine whether or not to believe them.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced that it had obtained an emergency court order halting the execution of a previously-convicted felon who had been sentenced to death for his role in the Rhoda County murder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s Complaint, the court granted the court's motion for an asset freeze and ordered the defendant to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000. The court also issued an order suspending the defendant from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  On October 21, 2018, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action, seeking a preliminary injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar. The SEC &rsqua;s complaint seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.   In its order, the Court also granted the motion for a hearing on October 24, 2018.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-01-2019. \u00c2\u00a0On October 26, 2019, the Honorable Judge Robert C. Hannan of the U. S. District Judge's Office in Oklahoma issued a temporary restraining order, ordering the defendant not to violate the federal securities laws, ordering him to surrender his passport, and requiring him to provide an accounting of his prior criminal history. The order also requires him to show that he has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area of the crime, and to provide a reasonable explanation for why he has not done so."
