  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a defendant for violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Orlando, Florida, alleges that, in 2015, the Florida state legislature passed a law that prohibited the possession of a concealed handgun in a vehicle.  According to the complaint, the legislature intended that a vehicle with a driver be concealed and readily accessible to the public, even if the driver is not.  In reality, the complaint alleges, a driver could not see the gun because the driver was in the driver's seat and the gun was hidden in the interior pocket of the car.  As alleged, however, the defendant had left the car door open and did not attempt to shut it, allowing the officers and any onlookers to see the handgun.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 166.250(1)(b) of the Securities Act of 1933, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  Additionally, the court granted the SEC\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, which prohibits the defendant from violating the charged provisions, and ordered the defendant to pay a $1,000 civil penalty in the amount of $100,000, which is equal to the amount that he has already paid in restitution to the victims of the alleged crime.  On August 2, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in Orlando entered a judgment against the defendant, permanently enjoining him from violating or violating the registration provisions of Sections 166(1) and 166(2)(b).  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida today announced criminal charges against the driver of a car who allegedly concealed his or her handgun in an interior pocket.   The court also issued an order requiring the driver to provide reasonable notice of the gun's presence, through ordinary observation, to a person \"standing next to defendant's closed vehicle door.\"  The Court of Appeals also ordered the driver not to attempt to obstruct or obstruct the view of a person in the vehicle, including a police officer, gas station attendant, or other person who may come into contact with the driver through an open window.  Finally, the SEC charged the driver with violating Section 17(a)(1) of The Securities Act, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Section"
