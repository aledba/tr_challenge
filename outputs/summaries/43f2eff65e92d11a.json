  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on May 21, 2020, entered a final judgment against a Texas-based company that refused to pay market-based rates for its natural-gas storage services.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that, in 2012, FERC granted authorization to charge \"just and reasonable\" rates for the services of two of DTE Energy Company\u2019s subsidiary companies, Washington 10 Storage Corporation and Michigan Consolidated Gas Company. The complaint alleges that FERC failed to adequately distinguish between DTE and its principal competitor by including market share and concentration in the relevant product and geographic markets.  According to the complaint, DTE was the largest competitor in the market for working gas, and its market share was substantially higher than those of its largest competitor.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's order, the company consented to the final judgment, which permanently enjoins it from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The final judgment also prohibits FERC from imposing a price-based rate on a publicly traded company.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against DTE. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil money penalties.  On May 22, 2019, the Honorable Judge Timothy J. Mascianica of the Federal Bureau of Investigation entered an order granting the SEC preliminary and permanent injunctions against future violations of Section 5 of the federal securities laws. The court granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, an order appointing a receiver, and an order requiring the receiver to conduct an independent examination of the market. The order also prohibits the receiver from making any prejudgment judgments against the receiver based on his or her prior actions.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 538 (January 21, 2019).  The Commission's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Karpel and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by David A. Schiff. The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FINCA) and the U.K. Department of Justice in this matter."
