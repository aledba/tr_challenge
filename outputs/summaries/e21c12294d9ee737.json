  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio today entered final judgments against two parents who were found liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Columbus, Ohio on September 11, 2017, Rachel M. and Joel M. of Ohio, who are married and have four children, made false statements to a trial court regarding the status of their children.  The complaint alleges that the defendants failed to adequately consider the needs of the children, including the need for permanent custody of S.M. and H.M., and failed to provide sufficient evidence to support their claims that the children were in the best interests of their families.  In addition, the complaint alleges, Joel and Rachel were not permitted to participate in the reunification process when the trial court granted a final judgment granting permanent custody to LCCS on March 16, 2018, without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  As alleged, the defendants' statements to the court were inconsistent with the evidence presented in the case.  For example, Rachel's first assignment of error, which was overruled, stated that she did not observe the children interacting with their parents, and that Joel was not present to observe or participate in any of the activities required by the court to determine whether to grant permanent custody.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted in the Office of the United States District Judge in Columbus by Scott A. Thompson and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Department of Children and Family Services, and the Ohio State Department of Health and Human Services in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Inspector General has issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage parents to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0Securities.gov\u00c2\u00a0On\u00c2\u00a0January\u00c2\u00a020, 2019, the Department of Justice announced that it had obtained an order appointing a temporary restraining order against Joel, Rachel, and Joel from violating the charged provisions of the federal securities laws.\u00c2\u00a0In a parallel action, the U.
