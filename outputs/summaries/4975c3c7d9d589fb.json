  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Central District of Texas today entered a final judgment in favor of a Texas man who was previously indicted for two felony counts of capital murder and three counts of aggravated robbery.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Taymor Travon McIntyre, who was sixteen when he was arrested in Texas, violated the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws by cutting off his ankle monitor and fleeing while under house arrest.  According to the complaint, Appellant was arrested and placed in the juvenile detention facility in Tarrant County, Texas, on July 4, 2016.  Appelleant was later charged with capital murder in the capital murder case and later convicted in the Arlington aggravated robbery case.  In a parallel action, the Texas Attorney General's Office today announced that it has obtained an emergency court order to hold a hearing on a pretrial writ of habeas corpus seeking a temporary restraining order and other emergency relief.  On May 25, 2017, the trial court granted the SEC's request for a preliminary injunction and ordered that the defendant be held without bail for a total of three months.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $500,000, which is equal to the amount of his disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties to be determined by the court at a later date.  Additionally, the court issued an order suspending the pretrial release order for Appelant, and ordering him to surrender his passport and other documents.   The court also granted the request for an expedited hearing on June 30, 2017.  As set forth in the order, the pendency of the hearing is based on the facts in the light of the evidence presented to the court by the defendant and the court.  For further information, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 151157 (D.W.2d 549, 550).  The complaint also names as a relief defendant a person who has served time in prison for a felony or an offense involving family violence and who was subsequently certified as an adult who had served time pretrial for a violation of a condition of release related to the safety of a victim of the alleged offense or to the community.
