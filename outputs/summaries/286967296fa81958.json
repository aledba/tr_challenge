  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered final judgments against Brisean Esprit and Mark Jones in a parallel criminal case.  The SEC's complaint alleges that, on September 10, 2008, Esprit was involved in the shooting of a 14-year-old boy at Stevenson's apartment complex in Houston, Texas.  According to the complaint, after Esprit told his cousin that he would turn himself in to the police to take responsibility for the shooting, he and Esprit allegedly engaged in an armed robbery of Stevenson, telling Esprit that he had a $3,000 pistol and that he wanted to buy some crack from Stevenson but did not have any money.  Esprit also allegedly told the complaint that he did not know that Stevenson had been carrying the gun, that he never had a conversation with Esprit about robbing Stevenson, and that Jones had told him not to rob Stevenson after he thought he had secured his own plea deal.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Esprit.    The case was investigated by the SEC's Office of Criminal Justice, which issued an\u00c2\u00a0Investigative Abuse Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage defendants to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment using the free and simple search tool on\u00c2\u00a0SEC.gov. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Atlanta Regional Office, with assistance from Eric Werner of the Office of Market Intelligence, and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Atlanta Office of Financial Regulation, and the Georgia Office of the Attorney General's Office in this matter."
