  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of the Hopfners, finding that they violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that Robin and Philip Hopfner violated Section 17(a)(1) of that federal securities laws and ordered Robin to relinquish her parental rights.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Little Rock, Arkansas, Robin agreed to be terminated from her parent's custody without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint.  Robin also agreed to participate in family counseling and to cooperate with the Department of Human Services in its investigation of the alleged abuse and neglect of the children.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Arkansas today announced criminal charges against Robin.  On March 27, 2018, the court entered an emergency order that terminated Robin's parental rights, ordering her to remain in Department custody and to comply with court orders to remove her from the agency's custody.  As part of the emergency order, Robin consented to the entry of a consent judgment that permanently enjoins her from future violations of the federal parental rights and orders her to pay a civil penalty of $100,000, and requires her to provide for a $75,000 officer-and-director bar and a $50,000 conduct-based injunction against her from participating in any future family counseling.  Additionally, the order requires Robin to remain drug-free and to clean the home, which is not in the children's best interest.   The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by Kelly L. Gibson and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry in the Atlanta Regional Office. \u00c2\u00a0The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson, Ms. Boggs, and Mr. Gibson under the supervision of Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI, the U.N. Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Arkansas Department of Health and Human Services."
