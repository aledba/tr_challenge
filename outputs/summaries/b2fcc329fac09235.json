  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a motion by the New York State Attorney General's Office to remove the defendant from the criminal justice system.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that on October 24, 2018, the defendant, together with an unapprehended accomplice, approached a New York City woman and demanded her personal property including her cell phone and wallet. The complaint further alleges that the defendant and the accomplice then surrounded the woman, who was later arrested and charged by the court.

Separately, the court granted the defendants' request for a temporary restraining order against further violations of Section 15(a)(1) and 15(b)(2)(A).  The court also ordered the defendant to comply with the court's order, ordering him to pay a $75,000 civil penalty, and requiring him to cooperate with outside entities, including the Department of Probation as well as social welfare agencies, to engage the defendant in efforts to help him address his criminal and otherwise anti-social behavior.
