  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Ohio yesterday entered a final judgment against HSBC Bank USA, National Association and its guarantor, Business Loan Center, LLC, in a civil action brought by the Gills.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Columbus, Ohio, the defendants-appellants agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders HSBC to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $461,477.44 plus interest of $14,033.66.  The judgment also imposes a $400,000 civil penalty against the other guarantors.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendants.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, HSBC has agreed to settle the charges against it by consenting to a judgment permanently enjoining it from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, ordering it to pay civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date, and ordering the payment of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  HSBC has also agreed to a settlement that is subject to court approval.  On May 17, 2018, the U. S. District Judge in Columbus issued a temporary restraining order and ordered HSBC to comply with the court's order.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the Public Finance Abuse Unit in the Miami Regional Office, and the case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Ohio Department of Insurance, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice, the Internal Revenue Service, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Office of the Ohio Secretary of State and the Ohio Division of Banking Regulation."
