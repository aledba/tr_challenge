  "summary": "On March 29, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a temporary restraining order against the construction of a new snowmobile bridge over the Adirondack River.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Buffalo, N.Y., alleges that, in 2012 and 2013, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) issued an order approving the construction and operation of a proposed Cedar River Bridge over the river. The order also ordered DEC to prepare a unit management plan for the project. The complaint alleges that DEC failed to adequately classify its proposed action, prepare an EIS, identify and thoroughly analyze potential adverse environmental impacts, make a significance determination, and prepare an Environmental Quality Review (EQR) before issuing the final EIS. The court also found that, on the basis of the EIS prepared, DEC failed not to adequately consider the potential impact of the proposed bridge on the river and on nearby properties. In addition, the court found that the Commission failed to consider the benefits of granting the variance against the adverse impacts to protected river resources, including the potential aesthetic impact of snowmobiling. The Court also found, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, that DEC violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that it violated Section 15-2701 of the Commission's Rules of Practice. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Michigan today announced criminal charges against the defendants. The case was supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Public Finance Abuse Unit. The litigation will be led by Kristin M. Brunner and supervised by Amy C. Barry.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
