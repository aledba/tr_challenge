The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that, as a result of defendants' misconduct and malfeasance, the trusts became insolvent, requiring it to assume administration of NYMIT and PATH in March 2006.  The complaint also alleges that the trustees, Jennifer Bartlett and Alice Nykaza, fraudulently concealed or misrepresented the financial condition of the trusts, the danger of operating deficits and issues associated with underwriting deficiencies, and common-law indemnification against all defendants.

On September 5, 2014, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against CRS, the trustee defendants, and two insurance brokers, alleging that, in violation of Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 5b2-1, that they breached their duty to the covered employees by failing to disclose material facts about the trust that were relevant to their duties and responsibilities as trustees.
