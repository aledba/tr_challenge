  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Arizona on July 9, 2015 entered a final judgment in favor of divorcee Billy William Buckholtz, finding that he violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The court also found that the parties entered into a separation agreement without a binding agreement concerning the payment of the home equity to Wife.  According to the court's order, the parties did not enter into a written agreement that did not include any provision for equitable distribution of the house equity.  Instead, the court found that Husband and Wife violated Section 5 of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for Arizona today announced criminal charges against Husband.   The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Phoenix, charges Buckholt with violating Section 5(a)(1) and Rule 5b2-3 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, Buckholtt consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of Section 5, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $127,435, which is equal to the amount of his military pension, and bars him from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  He also agreed to be enjoined from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any securities, other than for his own personal benefit, and to be barred from serving in the securities industry.  On July 17, 2015, the Arizona Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining order, freezing the assets of the parties, and ordering the court to determine whether the parties had a reasonable understanding regarding the allocation of the community property and whether the agreement was unfair.  It also issued an order requiring the parties to jointly consent to the issuance of judgments that impose civil penalties of $100,000 or more, and imposing a $75,000 civil penalty.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5-317 (January 24, 2019).  The Court also ordered the parties not to violate Section 5 and to pay civil penalties in the amounts of $125,435 each.  This order also prohibits the parties from imposing any civil penalty, and requires the parties pay a $25,500 civil penalty and a $50,000 joint bar.  Additionally, the order prohibits the defendants from destroying or selling any property, including"
