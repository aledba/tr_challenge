  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant in a case brought by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) against Perez. The court held that the agency had the right to determine whether to grant or deny a U visa to a defendant based on the facts alleged in the USCIS complaint. In its judgment, the court found that, in its opinion, the agency lacked jurisdiction to review a USCIS decision denying Perez\u2019s application for a visa. In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of International Affairs (OIEA) today announced that it had obtained a temporary restraining order against Perez from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The SEC also issued an order suspending the issuance of any U visa for a period of three years.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in New York, charges Perez with violations of Section 1252(a)(2)(B) and (c) thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. Perez has agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case is being handled by Kelly L. Gibson, John R. Rymas, and Eric R. Werner of the SEC's Boston Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Ms. Gibson and Ms. Werner. The Commission appreciates the assistance of the UIEA, the Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this matter."
