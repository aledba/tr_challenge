  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against three individuals who were convicted of wire fraud in connection with a $77 billion tax credit scheme.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Orleans, alleges that Peter Hoffman, Michael Arata, and Susan Hoffman violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the complaint, Hoffman and Arata violated the anti-fraud provision of the federal tax credit program.  In addition, the complaint alleges that Arata defrauded the state by falsely claiming that tax credits were property of a state agency when, in fact, they were not.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the charged provisions of Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 5(d) and of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and from participating in the issuance, purchase, or sale of any tax credit.

Sansone agreed to settle the case by consenting to the issuance of a Rule 29 injunction, which requires the defendants to show cause and effect in the case that they are liable for the violations of Section 5(b)(5) and (c) thereunder, and that they will be permanently enjoined from further violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of The Securities Act, and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder; and that the defendants will be jointly and severally liable for any civil penalties imposed by the court upon motion by the parties.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 206 (1), No. 207 (2) and No. 208 (4).  The court granted the defendants' motion for a preliminary injunction against future violations, ordered Arata to surrender his passport, and ordered him to"
