  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho today entered a final judgment against defendant Jesus Manuel Garcia, Jr., who was found guilty of second-degree murder, aggravated battery, use of a deadly weapon during the commission of the former crimes, and possession of a controlled substance.  The court found that Garcia violated the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\") and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\").  According to the court's order, Garcia consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the securities laws and orders him to pay $162,285.27 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his restitution.  Garcia also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of California today announced criminal charges against Garcia arising from the same conduct alleged in the SEC's complaint.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s findings, Garcia agreed to the imposition of a permanent injunction, a conduct-based injunction, and an officer-and-director bar against him from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney or as a judge in a case involving a defendant who had been convicted of a similar felony, and to a five-year prison sentence. The court also ordered Garcia to pay a $160,000 civil penalty, which is subject to court approval.  On August 2, 2019, the U. S. District Judge in Boise issued a temporary restraining order against Garcia, ordering him to comply with the court order, and ordering a hearing on August 4, 2019. The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Hahn and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry of the Denver Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Gregory A. Kasper. The case is being supervised by C.J. Kerstetter.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Idaho State Attorney General's Office, the FBI, and the Idaho Department of Criminal Justice."
