  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment in favor of Rebecca Benjamin, a South African citizen who was charged with defrauding her half-siblings in a custody case.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, Benjamin was initially the primary caregiver for P.J.K., who was born in 2012. In 2017, Benjamin informed Klundt she intended to move with her fianc\u00e9 to South Africa for roughly two years and planned to take the child with her.  The complaint alleges that Benjamin was not induced by an erroneous view of the law and instead acted as a pawn in the child\u2019s decision to be separated from his half-brother.  As alleged in the complaint, the court erred in finding that Benjamin had a history of drinking and driving and that he had changed his lifestyle and did not believe there would be issues going forward.  In addition, the complaint alleges Benjamin failed to notify the police or request supervised visitation though she was aware of the issue.  Benjamin also allegedly failed to inform his mother and siblings of the impending departure of their son, despite being told by the court that he would be able to move back to North Dakota after the court granted Benjamin a temporary restraining order preventing him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, Benjamin consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $1,000,000. Benjamin also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years and ordered to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest of $2,038, and to be restrained from associating with any third party.   The settlement is subject to court approval. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
