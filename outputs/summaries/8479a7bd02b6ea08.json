  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Kecole Dukes.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New York, alleges that, between August 2015 and March 2016, Dukes and his identical twin brother, Kemeca Dukes, conducted a series of controlled buys of cocaine base from defendant Dukes through a middleman named Xavier Johnson.  According to the complaint, Johnson told Johnson that he was going to see the Dukes brothers at a gas station and that he needed to go through Johnson and give her some crack cocaine.  Johnson replied that he had been breaking off small pieces from his customer\u2019s slab to sell for himself, and told Johnson he would try to find a gun for protection.  After Johnson left the apartment, the complaint alleges that Johnson returned with.6 grams of crack cocaine, which he gave to Goss.  On March 9, 2016, the SEC filed a civil injunctive action against Johnson, charging him with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and with aiding and abetting Dukes\u2019 violations of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the charged provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $10,000, which includes disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a $1,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney\u2019S Office for New York announced criminal prosecutions against Dukes in the parallel criminal case.
