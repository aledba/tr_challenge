  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Missouri today entered a final judgment in favor of a defendant who was found guilty of three felony counts of sodomy in the second degree, assault in the third degree, and felonious restraint entered by the Circuit Court of Jackson County following a jury trial.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, on July 21, 2016, Jerrill Green was charged with three counts of felony sodomy and one count of attempted kidnapping. The complaint alleges that the jury was presented with evidence of more than a single instance of strangulation against D.H. Green, who had been found guilty only of manslaughter and had been \"implicitly\" acquitted of the greater offense of first degree murder and could not be retried for murder. The SEC alleges that Green violated the antifraud provisions of Section 558.026 of the United States and Missouri Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and that he violated the pre-judgment provision of the federal securities laws.  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Mississippi today announced criminal charges against Green.  The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by John Rymas of the SEC Enforcement Division's Public Finance Abuse Unit and is being supervised by Marc Blau of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Blau. The case has been supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Missouri State Attorney General's Office, and the FBI in this matter."
