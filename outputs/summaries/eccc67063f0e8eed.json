  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana today entered a final judgment against M.C., a delinquent delinquent who was sentenced as an adult to the Department of Juvenile Justice (DOC).  The court's order, which was entered on March 19, 2019, finds that, in violation of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, Inc. (\"Advisers\").  The Court also found that, contrary to the stated intent of the court, M.c. was not a suspect class because he was not treated as a criminal and had received counseling and medication for that condition.  In addition, the court found that M. c. was a \"discrete and insular minority\" who had experienced life as a juvenile delinquent.  The Judge also ruled that, under Section 23 of the federal securities laws, a defendant can essentially control the length of his incarceration and the amount of time he spends in the institution.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's final judgment, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 13(b)(5) and 13(a)(2)(B)(3) and orders him to pay a $1,000 civil penalty and a $100,000 officer-and-director bar. The court also granted the defendant a temporary restraining order prohibiting him from associating with any third party, including an attorney, from participating in any offering of a penny stock or offering of any penny stock.  On March 20, 2020, a federal district court in Indianapolis issued an order granting the defendant wardship to the DOC.  According to the order, the pendency of the litigation will determine whether to proceed with a permanent injunction, impose a conduct-based injunction, and determine the appropriate amount of money to be spent on the child's education and rehabilitation.  For further information, see Litigation Release Order No. 17-cv-8221 (Feb. 26, 2020).  In a parallel action, the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the defendant for his role in a scheme to steal a pizza and two drinks from a Pizza King restaurant. The SEC's complaint charges the defendant with violating Section 13 of the Exchange Act and Rule 13a-14 thereunder. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. The case is being handled"
