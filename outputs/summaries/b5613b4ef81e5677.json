  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Michigan today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was convicted of arson in April 2017.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, alleges that Craig J. \"Craig\" Whitt was the first insurance counselor to respond to a fire at a Memphis, Tennessee, pawn shop.  According to the complaint, Whitt and his father, Christian J. Whitt, co-owned the pawn shop called Pawn Max, which was purchased in 2012 for $125,000 on a five-year-land contract, and was paid off within six months of the fire.  As alleged, the complaint alleges that defendant was staining a guitar with linseed oil on a rag to finish a guitar the day before the fire, which affected the progression of the blaze and the conclusion about the point of origin.    The complaint further alleges that, after being alerted by the insurance company that there was a fire, defendant returned to the storage room and entered the room alone and forced entry into the room, locking the door behind him, and then entering the room with the fire chiefs.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay a penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Whitt.  On May 31, 2017, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an officer-and-director bar against him from appearing or practicing before the court as an insurance counselor. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Justin J. Pyszka and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Chicago Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Federal Office of Inspector General in this matter."
