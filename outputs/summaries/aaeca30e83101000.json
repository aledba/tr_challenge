  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered summary judgment in favor of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) in a civil injunctive action brought by Sebesta.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Chicago, alleges that, in September 2010, a social worker at the University of Illinois Medical Center in Chicago raised concerns about the welfare of her newborn daughter, Elizabeth Marie.  According to the complaint, the social worker told her that she had a reasonable suspicion that her daughter was being abused or neglected.  She also told her mother, Gloria Bean, that the child had been hospitalized in the wake of what she described as a \"psychiatric break\" just weeks before her delivery.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC's complaints, the Social Worker consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins her from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders her to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York today announced criminal charges against SeBesta. The SEC also announced that it had obtained a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze.  On November 24, 2011, the court granted summary judgment against Sebestas, ordering her to comply with the court's order, and ordered her to surrender her passport and other documents related to her alleged history of abuse and neglect. The court also issued an order suspending her from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney.  A hearing scheduled for October 15, 2015, is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-0117 (January 20, 2016).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Chicago Regional Office.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Kasper and supervised by Eric R. Werner.  Litigation Counsel Robert C. Hannan will lead the litigation under the supervision of Amy C. Hershfang. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Illinois Attorney General's Office, and the Illinois Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
