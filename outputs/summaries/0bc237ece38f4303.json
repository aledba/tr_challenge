  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia today entered a final judgment against a Kansas City, Kansas man who was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for disseminating child pornography.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Va., on February 22, 2015, Daniel E. Cookson, a convicted felon, used Tor anonymizing software to access the internet without disclosing his prior criminal history and felony convictions.  The complaint alleges that, in 2015, the FBI obtained a search warrant for Cookson's home and used the software to obtain a copy of a court order that imposed a five-year prison sentence on him.  As alleged in the complaint, Cookson was the only defendant in the United States convicted of possession of child pornography, and the court found him liable for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 3553(a) of the federal securities laws.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the court's judgment, Mr.Cookson consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of these provisions, and orders him to pay a civil penalty of $75,000, which is equal to the amount of his prison sentence.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation today announced that it has issued an order imposing a temporary restraining order against Cookson and ordering him to comply with the court order.   The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Eric R. Werner of the Boston Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the FBI in this matter. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's Office of Investor Education and Advocacy has issued a\u00c2\u00a0Investor Alert\u00c2\u00a0to encourage investors to check the background of anyone selling or offering them an investment in an investment using the free and simple search tool on Investor.gov.  Investors can quickly and easily check the backgrounds of people selling investments by using the\u00c2\u00a0instant search tool\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0investor.gov to quickly identify whether they are registered professionals.\u00c2\u00a0In a related matter, the Office of Inspector General today issued an\u00c2\u00a0Adviser to the Department of Justice's Cyber Unit, which uses data analysis tools to detect suspicious patterns of activity in the real world. The Office has also issued an Investor Alert about the dangers of using this tool to spot suspicious patterns in the digital content of a website.  For example, the SEC alleges that the FBI misled a magistrate judge about the nature and circumstances of a network search, failed to consider the relevant factors, and failed to provide a reasonable explanation for the timing of the network search. The complaint also alleges that\u00c2\u00a0the FBI misled the magistrate judge\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0"
