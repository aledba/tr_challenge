  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment in favor of the couple, who were married in Richmond, California, on January 23, 1990.  The court found that Frederick and Audrey Pettersen were entitled to equitable distribution of marital assets and liabilities.  According to the court's order, the couple purchased a marital residence in Gautier, Mississippi in 1990. The court determined that the property was acquired during the marriage and was subject to property division.  In its judgment, the court also found that the couple had \"substantially contributed to this property by serving as bookkeepers\" and that Frederick had provided financial support to the purchase of the property.  Frederick also agreed to be responsible for any expenses associated with the purchase and management of the properties.  As alleged in the complaint, however, that the court did not consider the marital assets as a sufficient basis for ordering Frederick to pay child support.  Instead, Frederick was ordered to pay a one-time payment of $1,484,573.03 and then $2,500 per month until further order by the court.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the court, Frederick consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay $922,448.23 in disgorgement, $178,535 in prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $250,000.  Finally, the judgment orders Frederick to be liable for the amount of any civil penalties he will pay.    The SEC's investigation was conducted by Michael J. Mascianica and supervised by Jennifer C. Barry. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Office for the southern District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Department of Banking and Securities."
