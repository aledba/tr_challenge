  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against a Tennessee-based attorney who was barred from practicing law while on bedrest due to a history of poor performance and high absenteeism.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Memphis, Tennessee, alleges that Andrea Mosby-Meachem, an attorney for Memphis Light, Gas & Water Division, was unlawfully barred from performing her job as an attorney while on the job. The complaint also alleges that Mosby Meachem was not qualified to perform her job because her law license was suspended and she was required to work from home for the 10-week period during which she requested to telework. The SEC alleges that, contrary to the SEC's representations to the court and to the jury, the complaint was not supported by the facts presented at trial. In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Tennessee today announced that it filed a civil injunctive action and obtained a temporary restraining order and an asset freeze. The court also denied the complaint, which was filed under seal on March 14, 2017.  In its order, the court entered a judgment that permanently enjoins the defendant from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders the defendant to pay $18,184.32 in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and the defendant must pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of her earnings.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, the defendant has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining her from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering her to pay a $92,000 civil penalty, and imposing a $10,000 officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval.  For further information, see Litigation Release No. 17-cv-8221 (March 14, 2011).  The case is being supervised by Kelly L. Gibson, Chief of the Market Abuse Unit, and Amy S. Cotter of the Atlanta Regional Office.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Tennessee Department of Justice, the Federal Office of Inspector General, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Tennessee Office of the Attorney General's Office."
