  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Mexico today announced criminal charges against Helen Benally for her role in a medical negligence claim.  According to the SEC's complaint, on November 23, 2008, Ms. Benally underwent surgery for a fractured femur at Gallup Indian Medical Center in Gallup, New Mexico. The surgery aimed to repair the broken femur by using a plate and screws to hold the bone fragments in place and to give proper alignment to the upper femur. The complaint alleges that the surgery was performed negligently and above the standard of care, and that, in addition to failing to mention the potential failure of the hip hardware during the surgery, Benally failed to mention that the hip replacement equipment had failed, causing severe pain and serious mobility problems.  The complaint also alleges that, after the procedure was performed, the surgery equipment gave way and separated from the hip, causing Benally severe pain, serious mobility issues, and she ultimately received a total hip replacement from a different facility.  In a complaint filed in federal court in New Mexico, the SEC alleges that Benally violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and the reporting provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Investment Advisers, LLC (\"Advisers\"), and Rule 206(3)-8 thereunder. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the federal securities laws, orders them to pay civil penalties in the amount of $1.1 million, and bars them from serving as officers or directors of any public health organization. The settlement is subject to court approval.  On March 24, 2013, a federal district court in Albuquerque, N.M., granted the SEC request for a temporary restraining order, ordered a preliminary injunction, and ordered a conduct-based injunction against future violations.  A hearing on March 26, 2013 was scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern.  An SEC examination that led to the investigation was conducted by David A. Staggs and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson of the Atlanta Regional Office. The litigation will be led by Mr. Stags and Ms.Benally. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of Health and Human Services, the U."
