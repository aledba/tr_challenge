  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Utah today announced criminal charges against a Utah man accused of orchestrating the kidnapping of two individuals (Middleman and Victim).  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, Chris Leech, a convicted felon, and his accomplice, Viliamu Seumanu, lured Middleman and victim to a remote location in Weber Canyon, Utah.  The complaint alleges that, on the night of the kidnapping, Leech told Middleman to lie face down, side-by-side on the floor, and instructed him to clean, vacuum, and shampoo the truck. The complaint further alleges that when Middleman refused to cooperate with the investigation, he was shot and killed by Leech. The SEC alleges that the defendants then hid the bodies of the victims, who were later identified as victims.  In a parallel action, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Leech that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and an officer-and-director bar. The final judgment also orders the defendant to pay a $75,000 civil penalty.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, Seumanus has consented to the entry of a judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to disgorge ill-advised gains with interest, and imposing a $50,000 penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The SEC also obtained a temporary restraining order and an order freezing the assets of the defendants and ordering the destruction of any evidence that may be relevant to the case. The court also granted the SEC request for a preliminary injunction, which is pending final approval by the court. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Utah Attorney General's Office and the Utah State Corporation Commission in this matter."
