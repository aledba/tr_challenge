  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois today entered a final judgment against Clare Oaks, Inc., a nursing home, and its former director of nursing, Thomas M. Pignatiello, on charges of violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 17a-3 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Chicago, alleges that, from at least March 2011 through March 2015, Clare Oaks and Pignattiello violated the standard of care provisions of the federal securities laws by failing to disclose to the court that the nursing staff at Clare Oaks did not perform the standard care required of a physician when evaluating a patient with atrial fibrillation. The complaint further alleges that Pignatallo violated Section 5 of the Nursing Home Care Act of 1940 and Rule 5b-5 thereunder, and that, as a result of her failure to comply with these provisions, she was barred from appearing as an expert witness on the matter. The court also denied Clare Oaks' motion for a hearing on the merits of the case.  In its order granting the SEC's motion, the court found that Clare Oaks violated the pre-judgment provisions of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4)-8 of the Exchange Act and Rules 206(3)-8 thereunder and that the court was entitled to a judgment ordering Clare Oaks to pay $4,111,477.66 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty of $1,500,000.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the charged provisions and orders them to pay a $5,000 civil penalty. The settlement is subject to court approval. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the U. S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of New York, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Illinois Department of Health and Human Services in this matter."
