  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas yesterday entered a final judgment in favor of summary judgment against Robert J. Stawarczik, Jr., the decedent\u2019s nephew, and four other individuals in a parallel action for summary judgment on the estate of Annie Ruth Danford.  According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in federal district court in Houston, Texas on December 23, 2010, the date Danford executed the 2010 Will, the first Will she executed the will.  The complaint alleges that, at the time of the will's execution, Danford had a fiduciary relationship with her executor and sole beneficiary, and that she signed the will on the same date she executed it.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties in amounts to be determined by the court at a later date.  In addition, the court granted the Hunolds a temporary restraining order, which prohibits them from making or selling any offering of securities, and ordered them to provide depositions and testimony in support of the judgment.  On January 24, 2016, the Honorable Amy C. Welshhans of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) entered final judgments against the defendants, finding them liable to disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interests, and ordering them to be enjoined from future securities law violations.
