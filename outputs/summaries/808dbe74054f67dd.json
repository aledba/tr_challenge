  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against an officer who resigned from the New Jersey Police Department to settle pending drug-related disciplinary charges.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in New Jersey, alleges that the Board of Trustees of the Police & Firemen's Retirement System (PFRS) acted arbitrarily by refusing to process Cardinale's application for ordinary disability benefits.  According to the complaint, the Board's refusal to process the application was based on its finding that the officer had suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and was unable to perform his duties as a police officer.  As alleged in the complaint:  The Board's finding, which was accepted by the court, is that a person with a disability can never return to duty as a result of a disciplinary action arising out of a disability.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint in the SEC's Complaint, Cardinales consented to the entry of a final judgment that permanently enjoins him from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders him to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, a civil penalty, and a bar against him from serving as an officer or director of a public company.  In a parallel action, the U.N. Office of Inspector General today announced that it has issued an order suspending CardinALE from working as a member of the PFRS for a period of five years.  It also issued a preliminary injunction, which prohibits cardinale from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any security, including the right to reapply after five years of service.  On March 4, 2014, the Police Department issued a Preliminary Notice of Disciplinary Action (PNDA) and removed him as a PFRS member on the basis of his irrevocable resignation from active duty.  A hearing officer conducted a disciplinary hearing on March 21, 2014. The hearing officer also conducted a drug and alcohol examination the following day, which showed that he had tested positive for a substance abuse-related drug.  Finally, the hearing officer made a recommendation to the Board not to process his application, which the Board approved without admitting or denied the allegations in the Complaint.  After the hearing, the board agreed to a permanent injunction and to the issuance of an order permanently enjoining him from future violations of the federal securities laws, ordering him to submit to a random drug test, and requiring him to participate in a supervised release"
