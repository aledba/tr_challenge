  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered an equitable distribution order against a husband and wife who were married for 18 years.  The SEC's complaint alleges that the trial court improperly classified and valued a portion of the marital property and in granting an unequal distribution of the property.  According to the complaint, filed in federal district court in Charlotte, North Carolina, Husband and his wife had only a few assets and a home acquired a year before the marriage. The court found that the property was separate property and that it was not subject to equitable distribution. The complaint also alleges that Husband took out a Cadillac El Dorado, which is marital property, but the court found there was insufficient evidence to value the property as such, and that the value of the equity in the home was not valued.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina today announced criminal charges against Husband. The SEC also announced that it would conduct a civil injunctive action against Husbands.  To determine whether to proceed with a proper equitable distribution, the court ordered Husband to pay a civil penalty of $1,880.00 and ordered him to remove his name from the deed and pay the HELOC, which was secured by the marital residence during the marriage, in a timely manner.  Husband also agreed to pay an $8,920.00 civil penalty and to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement is subject to court approval.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of the final judgment permanently enjoining them from future violations of the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and ordering him to pay disgorgement of $42,689.58 with prejudgment interest of $2,829.58, and to pay civil penalties of $10,000 each. The final judgment also prohibits Husband from participating in the issuance, purchase, offer, or sale of any investment in any financial instrument other than the investment in a home or a 401K plan. The defendants agreed to settle the case by consenting to a final judgment that permanently enjoins them from violating these provisions, and orders them to jointly and severally disgorge their allegedly ill-gotten gains with each other. The settlements are subject to Court approval. The litigation will be led by Mr. and Ms. Williams, and the case is being supervised by"
