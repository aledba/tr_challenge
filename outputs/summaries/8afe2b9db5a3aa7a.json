  "summary": "On April 30, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington entered a final judgment against Heritage Baptist Church v. City of Seattle, finding that the church violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Seattle, alleges that Heritage violated the federal securities laws by failing to adequately evaluate the potential adverse environmental impacts of certain of the city\u2019s plans and development plans.  According to the complaint, the Board improperly required Heritage to provide a detailed analysis of the possible adverse environmental consequences of its actions in its 2016 order.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC complaint, Heritage consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins the city from violating the securities laws, and orders Heritage to pay a civil penalty in the amount of $10,000.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Heritage for its role in the alleged scheme.  On April 24, 2017, the court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, an asset freeze, and an order appointing a receiver to oversee the rezone of the property.   The court's order, which is subject to court approval, requires Heritage to comply with the requirements of Sections 206(1), 206(2), and 206(4) of Exchange Act Rules 206(3) and 206 (4)-8 thereunder, as well as with the issuance of an order requiring Heritage to submit an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in response to a finding of invalidity by the Commission on the subject of the Commission's 2014 order. The court also granted Heritage the right to apply for a preliminary injunction against future violations of the Exchange Act, and to appoint a receiver for the receiver of the receiver. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's continuing investigation is being conducted by John Rymas and supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay in the Seattle Regional Office. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Seattle Office of Inspector General, and the Office of the Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
