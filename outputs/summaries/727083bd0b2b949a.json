  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Utah today entered a final judgment in favor of the Utah State Tax Commission against the company.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Salt Lake City, Utah, alleges that the Utah Department of Revenue (SDRA) improperly allocated income between related entities in violation of Section 59-7-113 of the federal tax code.  According to the complaint, the SDRA requires the federal government to allocate income when it deems it necessary to prevent evasion of taxes or to reflect the income of related entities.  For example, the complaint alleges that, in 1997, the Utah Legislature passed a federal tax law that required allocating income between unrelated companies on terms that were favorable to the interests of the unrelated companies.  In addition, the SEC alleges that in 2010, the federal district court in Utah issued an order requiring SDRA to determine whether a certain amount of income should be allocated as a business expense.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, SDRA has agreed to settle the matter by consenting to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins SDRA from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. SDRA also agreed to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief. The settlement is subject to court approval.   The case is being handled by John Rymas of the Salt Lake Regional Office, under the supervision of Joseph G. Sansone, Chief of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the United States Attorney's Office for Utah, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Utah Secretary of State's Office in this matter."
