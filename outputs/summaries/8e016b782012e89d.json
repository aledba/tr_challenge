  "summary": "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota today announced criminal charges against a Minnesota man accused of selling methamphetamine to a confidential informant.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Minnesota, alleges that Donald J. Strobel, who was in custody since January 2016, sought a speedy trial based on his 2012 fifth-degree controlled-substance offense. The complaint alleges that Strobel sought a trial on the basis of his prior criminal history, and that the state did not meet its burden to determine whether Strobel had a prior felony conviction. Instead, the complaint alleges, Strobel demanded that the trial be delayed until the end of the 60-day period for the state to prepare for trial. The SEC alleges that, despite Strobel\u2019s demand, the delay in bringing his case to trial resulted in substantial restrictions on his liberty, including his ability to work or see his family or friends as a result of the delay.  Strobel also alleges that the delay delayed Strobel from appearing before the district court for a rule 5 hearing, which was scheduled for March 20, 2017, when Strobel was originally scheduled to appear before the court. The district court agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint. The settlement is subject to court approval.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney for Minnesota today filed criminal charges in federal district court in Minneapolis against Strobel. The court granted the SEC's request for a temporary restraining order, ordered Strobel to surrender his passport, and ordered him to pay a civil penalty of $200,000. The case was supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Division of Criminal Investigations. The litigation will be led by Jennifer C. Barry and supervised by Amy C. Welshhans.\u00c2\u00a0 The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Minnesota Department of Justice, and the Minnesota State Attorney General's Office in this matter."
