  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against The First Presbyterian Church of Tulsa, Oklahoma and its minister for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Oklahoma City, alleges that The First Presbyterians of Tulsa (FPC) and James D. Miller of Osage, Oklahoma (Miller) violated the federal securities laws by publishing notice of Doe's baptism on the world wide web.  According to the complaint, Doe simply asked to be baptized, not to become a member of the church, and only sought baptism if this process could be private and not publicized.  As alleged, Doe's conversion placed him squarely under the rules of the Presbyterian Church and its denomination.  Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently restrains and enjoin them from violating the above-mentioned provisions.  In its order, the court also ordered the defendants to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties equal to the amount of their profits.   The court's order also imposed a temporary restraining order against the defendants from further violating the charged provisions, and ordered Miller to disgorge his ill-gotten gains plus interest, pay a civil penalty, and pay a $10,000 civil penalty to be determined by the court at a later date. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, is being conducted by Michael J. Burt and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Oklahoma Office of Inspector General."
