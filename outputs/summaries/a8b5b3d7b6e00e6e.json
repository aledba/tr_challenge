  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York today entered a final judgment against Rockstar Games, Inc., a New York-based video game company, and its former CEO for violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  The SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Rockstar and former CEO Michael R. Shank raised the issue of whether a person's likeness should constitute a \"portrait\" within the meaning of the federal securities laws.  According to the complaint, Shank and Shank used the \"Stop and Frisk\" image on the packaging for the game, and the \"Beach Weather\" image in the video game disc.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New York announced criminal charges against Shank.  As alleged in the SEC's Complaint, Shank violated Sections 5(a), 5(c), and 17(a) of The Securities Act of 1933 (\"Securities Act\").  The complaint also alleges that Shank violated Section 15(b)(5) of Exchange Act Rule 10a-5 and Rule 15b2-1 thereunder, and that Shank, Shank, and Shank violated Rule 15a-3 thereunder in violation of Section 5 of the Exchange Act.  Shank agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins him from future violations of the charged provisions, and orders him to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty equal to the amount of his ill-gotten gains plus interest, in amounts to be determined by the court upon motion by the SEC.  On May 24, 2018, the Honorable Joseph G. Sansone of the New York Court of Appeals entered an order permanently enjoining Shank from violating the charged sections of the securities laws, ordering Shank to disgorge $1,038,768, plus prejudgment interests of $2,065, and ordering Shank and Schumacher to pay civil penalties of $100,000 and $50,000, respectively, for violations of Section 50(b).  The court also issued an order suspending Shank from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an attorney in a case involving a defendant who had been convicted of securities fraud and sentenced to 10 years in prison.   The Court's order also ordered Shank to pay a $1.5 million civil penalty. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Ann-Margret and Graham Loomis of the SEC Enforcement Division's Cyber Unit and the Division of Enforcement's Retail Strategy Task Force.\u00c2\u00a0"
