  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of New Hampshire today entered a final judgment against a defendant who was charged with three drug-related charges.  According to the SEC's complaint, Christina A. Hill, a resident of Grafton, New Hampshire, engaged in the conduct while on bail on three of the charged charges. The complaint alleges that, by possessing and selling controlled drugs, the defendant violated the bail provisions of the federal bail laws.  The complaint further alleges that the defendants violated the pre-arraignment or pretrial detention provisions of RSA 597:2, III(b)(1) and IV(a) of the bail laws, which require a trial court to set unaffordable bail based upon the court's determination that the defendant poses a flight risk.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, Hill consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins her from violating the bail provision, and orders her to pay a $10,000 civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for New Hampshire announced parallel criminal charges against Hill.  On March 2, 2019, the U. S. Attorney's office for the Eastern District of Connecticut announced criminal charges and a temporary restraining order against Hill, who was later sentenced to prison.  To learn more about the court-ordered release of a defendant, see Litigation Release Release Release Order No. 597-2 (Supp. 2018).
