  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Massachusetts today entered a final judgment against a Boston man who was charged with insider trading in the illicit sale of more than 200 grams of marijuana.  The court also entered a temporary restraining order against the defendant.  According to the court's order, on June 9, 2014, the Boston Police received a tip about a possible drug transaction involving a green Volvo station wagon containing approximately $11,000 in illicit drugs. The tipster allegedly provided the information to the police, who focused their search on the defendant's vehicle because of a tip he had received from an unknown source. The court found that the tipster provided no corroboration of the police's findings, and the officer followed the defendant out of the vehicle.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against the individual. The SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Boston, charges the defendant with violating the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks a permanent injunction, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty. Without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations, the defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment, which permanently enjoins him from future violations of the federal securities laws, and orders him to pay a $25,000 civil penalty and a $10,000 officer-and-director bar. The settlement is subject to court approval. The case is being supervised by Chedly C. Dumornay, Chief of the Boston Division of Criminal Investigations. \u00c2\u00a0The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Massachusetts Department of Banking and Securities, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Department of Homeland Security, the Internal Revenue Service's Criminal Investigations Division, the FBI's Retail Strategy Task Force, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the Massachusetts Secretary of State's Office."
