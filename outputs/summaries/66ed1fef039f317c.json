  "summary": "On February 1, 2019, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas entered a final judgment against RCX Solutions, Inc., a licensed motor carrier that contracted with a driver to transport a load of L'Oreal freight across Texas.  The court found that RCX violated the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal district court in Dallas, Texas, on January 18, 2013, RCX's driver, Ronald Brown, crossed the median into oncoming traffic and crashed into Alexandro Puga's truck.  Brown did not survive the accident, and his wife, Norma Puga, suffered significant injuries.  As alleged in the complaint, Brown was not employed by RCX and was acting negligently when the accident occurred.  In a parallel action, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York today announced criminal charges against Brown.  To learn more about liability under the federal securities laws, see Litigation Release No. 5, No. 13-20, and No. 17-1.  For further information on liability under Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(c) thereunder, see Rules 12b-20 and 13a-1, and Rules 13b2-2, 13b-3, and 13d-1 thereunder; Rules 13a through 13(e) and 13e through 13e-14; Rules 14b-15, 13e under 13e; Rules 16a through 16e-17; Rules 17a through 17e-1; Rules 15a through 15e-3; and Rules 16b through 16.  Without admitting or denying the SEC\u2019s allegations, the court has agreed to the entry of a judgment that permanently enjoins RCX from violating the charged provisions of the federal laws, orders it to pay disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, and orders the company to pay a civil penalty equal to the amount of its profits.  RCX also agreed to be barred from associating with any broker, dealer, municipal, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.   The SEC acknowledges the assistance of the Texas Department of Insurance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Texas Office of Insurance Regulation in this matter."
