  "summary": "The U.S. District Court for the District of Mississippi today entered a final judgment against Mississippi resident David J. Vitkauskas for alienation of affections.  According to the SEC's complaint, filed in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi on December 22, 2017, Vitkauskaus filed a motion to dismiss, inter alia, for insufficient service of process under Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 4(c)(5), which requires a court to determine whether a defendant has the requisite minimum contacts with a state.  The complaint alleges that, in a parallel action, the Mississippi Court of Appeals granted the motion for a temporary restraining order and issued a preliminary injunction, freezing the defendants' assets, and ordering the defendants to pay disgorgement of ill-gotten gains plus interest, penalties, and injunctive relief.  Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants consented to the entry of final judgments that permanently enjoin them from violating the antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 10(b) of Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and orders them to pay prejudgment interest and civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 each.  In a separate administrative proceeding, the court issued an order suspending the defendants from appearing or practicing before the SEC as part of a case-by-case review.  On January 10, 2018, the trial court entered an order finding that the defendants violated the Due Process Clauses of the federal securities laws, ordering them to comply with the court's order suspending them from appearing, practicing, or practicing in the public square.   The SEC's investigation, which is continuing, has been conducted by Michael J. Hannan and supervised by Kelly L. Gibson. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the Mississippi Office of the Attorney General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Mississippi Department of Justice in this matter."
